# Senate Committee Video Scraper


## Requirements

A `requirments.txt` file is linked in the repository. While more then 3 packages are listed, the main 3 packages
to work with the scraper are:

* Beautiful Soup
* Pandas
* Requests

To run the scraper, the main option is to run `MergeSenateVideoFiles.py` which will run all the scrapers for the committees and then merge them into
a master CSV file.
