Encouraging Entrepreneurship: Growing Business, Not Bureaucracy1 
 
Tim Kane 
 
Testimony before the Joint Economic Committee 
U.S. House of Representatives 
July 12, 2016 
 
Chair Coats, Vice Chair Tiberi, Ranking Minority Member Maloney, and 
members of the Joint Economic Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify at this 
hearing on “Encouraging Entrepreneurship: Growing Business, Not Bureaucracy.”  
I am Tim Kane. I am a Research Fellow of the Hoover Institution, a nonpartisan 
research institute at Stanford University. I represent my own views only. 
The topic you have assembled to consider is the single most important issue that is 
holding back potential growth in gross domestic product, jobs, and real wages. It is a 
bipartisan concern, so allow me to express my respect for your joint work on improving 
the entrepreneurial climate in the U.S., despite the incentives you have in an election year 
to fight instead. 
Entrepreneurship – the birth of new firms – remains poorly understood by 
economic theory which often oversimplifies it out of existence in macroeconomic 
models, but it is well understood by farmers, struggling small business owners, and idle 
workers with big dreams. What I’d like to do with my time is set theory aside, and to 
connect three points using empirical data.  
Point number one is that the U.S. economy has been experiencing what I call a 
Great Deceleration for half a century. Each period of recovery has been slower than the 
past – a trend that transcends political terms of Presidents and partisan majorities, not to 
mention economic fads on campus. In the first figure in my written testimony, I showed 
the average annualized growth rate of GDP as well as the percentile contribution of its 
components. I only counted data for expansionary periods, yielding five expansions that 
include the current expansion, as well as expansionary periods in the late 1970s, the 
1980s, the 1990s, and the 2000s.

Force intelligence officer, and former senior economist at the Joint Economic Committee. 
Figure 1 
 
Each expansion trough and peak is determined by the business cycle dating 
committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and of course those expansions 
are different lengths of time. For example, the 80s expansion started in the first quarter 
(Q1) of 1983 and lasted until Q2 of 1990, for a total of 30 quarters. The Late 1970s 
expansion lasted only 19 quarters, whereas the 90s expansions was 39 quarters long. 
Currently, the U.S. is in the 27th quarter of expansion.  
What surprised me when I assembled this data is how clear the deceleration in 
average growth rates has been. Each expansion is slower than the one before, by just 
under 1 percentage point per period. The growth rate was 4.5 percent during the 1980s 
expansion (note this is not the same as the 1980s decade, nor the Reagan years). The 
1990s expansion saw slightly slower growth at 3.8 percent per year. Then 2.8 percent 
during the 23 months of expansion from 2002-2007. Which brings us to our current era 
with an average GDP growth rate of 2.1 percent. 
Americans can feel this slowdown and are looking to us with questions, and I wish 
I had easy answers for you. These growth rates count only real GDP, meaning after 
correcting for price inflation. These past 50 years have been marked by a technological 
boom like nothing in human history. International trade has boomed. Patents have 
boomed. Food is cheaper and safer. Mortality is lower. Material quality of life is better in 
every – almost every – way. Yet growth is slowing.  
Figure 2 
 
A common reaction among my fellow economists is that the current slowdown is 
an illusion of demographics. This is incorrect. My second figure merges government 
GDP data with government population data over the past 50 years. The average yearly 
growth rate of GDP per capita peaked at 4.15 percent during the Early 1970s expansion. 
Then the deceleration hit: 3.5 percent in the next two expansions, then 2.5, then 1.9, and 
for the past 27 quarters the growth of GDP per capita is at a low 1.4 percent per year. If 
this trend continues, the U.S. economy will stop growing around 2030. 
I believe this trend can be reversed. A rebirth of the American economy should be 
the government’s top priority. And I believe that can happen if the government does less 
regulating rather than more.

Point number two is that the dynamism of the U.S. economy has been slowing for 
decades. Dynamism is a term I learned from Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business 
School and co-author of my book, BALANCE.  In recent decades, there have been 
declines in the number of new startups, in gross job creation, and worker mobility. It is a 
trend appearing in a variety of data sources including the Job Openings and Labor 
Turnover data, the Bureau of labor Statistics’ Business Employment Dynamics data, and 
business dynamics measures from the Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics.  
Figure 3 shows that the percentage of U.S. firms that are startups, a term I use to 
define a newly founded company in its first year of existence. During the Carter 
administration, roughly 14 percent of U.S. companies were startups. That rate declined by 
one percentage point during the Reagan years, two points during the recession of the 
George H.W. Bush presidency, held steady under Bill Clinton, dropped a percentage 
point under George W. Bush, and then dropped two full points during the first term of 
President Obama. The most recent data available are for 2013, yet this startup ratio has 
held steady at 8.0 percent, down slightly from 2011. 
New companies create roughly 3 million jobs every year, while existing 
companies tend to shed 1 million jobs net. A study I published back in 2010 found that in 
most years startups create 100 percent of all net new jobs. Older firms create fewer jobs 
in gross terms, and tend to be net job destroyers. The bottom line is that net job creation 
is literally nothing without startups. Even in gross terms, start-ups punch above their 
weight, with 16 percent of all new jobs created by start-ups.  And with the decline in 
startups, there has been a decline in gross job creation and destruction, documented in 
many papers by many economists. The decline is associated with reductions in 
productivity, real wages and employment. 
I should emphasize that immigrants are a vital source of entrepreneurial talent. 
Research shows that immigrants to the United States are significantly more likely to 
create new startups than native-born workers are.  
Twenty percent of the workforce was employed by young small and medium 
enterprises in the early 1980s according to data collected by professor John Haltiwanger, 
but today fewer than ten percent are. Perhaps the growing concentration of larger firms 
isn’t a threat to GDP growth if it represents a process of merely weeding out 
unproductive mom and pop shops. Silicon Valley tech firms are booming, no? No. In 
March of this year, Haltiwanger and three other economists published a report showing 
the overall decline in entrepreneurial activity since the 1980s has spread to high-growth 
young firms since 2000, even in technology sectors. This is not a false alarm. 
Weak startup dynamism highlights a labor market problem: government is 
discouraging entrepreneurship. It’s passive, maybe even unintentional, but the 
institutional hostility to entrepreneurs is very real. 
This is point number three. Taxes are more complex. Regulations are thicker. 
Employment law is more dangerous. The instinct for elected leaders to protect voters 
from the consequences of economic change and economic fluctuations may well be 
counterproductive. Mandatory benefits cost a typical employer half of total wages and 
salaries. This burden raises costs and depresses wages. For example, employer-provided 
health insurance was initially sparked as an optional perk by favorable tax treatment 
during the 1940s, but is now mandatory under the Affordable Care Act. Today, workers 
are less willing to leave current jobs for alternatives (including entrepreneurship), known 
as ""job lock.” 
The negative relationship between regulation and entrepreneurial activity seems 
obvious, but I must warn you that scholars have not settled the issue. George Mason 
University economists Alex Tabarrok and Nathan Goldschlag combined data on 
dynamism with a novel industry-level measure of regulation that combs the Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) for restrictive terms and found, counterintuitively, that more 
regulated industries had slightly more startup activity. I disagree with their finding, and 
caution that their regulation variable is new and superficial, but highlight their research to 
show that root causes remain unresolved. 
I would suggest that a better measure of regulatory burden on startups is 
occupational licensing.  When an individual chooses between working for an established 
firm or as an entrepreneur, they must weight the extra costs and risks of starting their own 
company. Incorporation is daunting. Even establishing an LLC requires paperwork and a 
fee.  Perhaps the biggest (and growing) burden is occupational licensing. More than one-
in-three workers today need a government license to work, compared to one-in-twenty in 
the 1950s. Occupational licensing not only hinders employment levels, but hinders 
occupational mobility, and has been criticized by liberals and conservatives alike, 
including the Obama administration. 
It is tempting to believe that regulations are well-intentioned and save lives. Surely 
some do, but this is a naïve rule of thumb. Adam Smith himself noted the tendency of 
older firms to conspire for regulatory protections from the government against new 
competitors. Horse buggy makers were the greatest supporters of car safety regulations. 
As a general rule, without any government guidance or regulation, the market itself exerts 
the greatest discipline for safety as one of the many desirable features of a product. I 
would urge the members to support efforts to trim federal regulations, to put sunset 
clauses into new regulatory legislation, and to provide more oversight of anti-competitive 
state and local licensing.

Chairman Coats, Vice Chairman Tiberi, Ranking Member Maloney and 
members of the Joint Economic Committee, thank you for the opportunity to 
provide testimony regarding “Encouraging Entrepreneurship” Growing 
Business, Not Bureaucracy”.  My name is Tom Walker, CEO of Rev1 Ventures, 
located in Columbus, Ohio.   
 
Rev1 Ventures is a seed-stage investor that combines investment capital and 
strategic services to help entrepreneurs build products people want and 
companies that succeed.  
 
Rev1 Ventures was established to focus solely on identifying, supporting, and 
funding the most promising high-tech, high-growth businesses in the 15-
county central Ohio Region. Rev1 Labs accelerator is home to more than 50 of 
the region’s most promising companies. 
 
As a public-private partnership, Rev1 is a dedicated vehicle for accelerating 
startups and high growth businesses in the region. 
 
CCCCOOOONNNNNNNNEEEECCCCTTTTEEEEDDDD    AAAASSSSSSSSEEEETTTTSSSS    PPPPRRRROOOODDDDUUUUCCCCEEEE    RRRREEEESSSSUUUULLLLTTTTSSSS    
 
The Columbus region has had a strong mix of assets with a rich corporate 
base, major universities, led by powerhouse The Ohio State University, and 
large research institutions such as Nationwide Children’s Hospital and Battelle.   
 
As the fifteenth largest state, Ohio benefits from a strong and growing 
economy. Back in 2012, these assets were strong, but the startup economy 
 
 
was not. In 2011, the Columbus region was not on the map for generating new 
businesses based on research by the Kauffman Foundation.  
 
Fast forward to 2016. In a just a few years, we’ve accomplished what some 
regions have taken decades or more to do. 
 
The Columbus region is now seen as a case study for how to connect the 
assets in a region to generate the capital and support startups need to prove 
their idea, build the product and grow market share.  
 
In just three short years, Rev1 Ventures has received national validation, 
including: 
 
-  Columbus is the #1 region in the country in 2016 for scaling startups on 
a per capita basis and the fastest-growing city for startup activity in the US in 
2015 by the Kauffman Foundation. 
  
-  Columbus ranked #4 in the U.S. for Growth Entrepreneurship in 2016 in 
the overall Kauffman Index 
 
-  Rev1 named the most active venture investor in the Great Lakes Region 
between 2012-2015 by Pitchbook.  
 
-  Rev1 named the #1 investor in Ohio in 2016 by CB Insights. 
 
-  Ohio was in the Top 10 States in the 2015 Inc. 5000. Three of the 175 
firms on the Inc. 5000 ranking leveraged Rev1’s services: Capture Education 
(#295/1552% growth); Plug Smart (#339/1391% growth), and Updox 
(#254/886% growth) 
 
-  Central Ohio is home to the only JPMorgan Chase and UP Global 
Startup Week in Ohio.  Launched in 2015 Start-Up Week has grown to over 
2300 attendees. A huge success for the region, the Rev1 social campaign 
alone netted over 240,000 impressions. 
 
This has put Rev1 and the Columbus region on target to generate $2B in 
economic impact through the combined revenues generated and capital 
attract to the companies we assist. 
 
 
 
 
 
HHHHOOOOWWWW    DDDDIIIIDDDD    WWWWEEEE    DDDDOOOO    IIIITTTT????    
 
The Ohio Third Frontier Bond Renewal Amendment (also known as 
Amendment 1) was approved on May 4, 2010 and authorized the state to 
spend $700 MM in bonds over five years on the Ohio Third Frontier program. 
Rev1 Ventures is part of the Ohio Third Frontier statewide network of 
resources providing access to business expertise, mentorship, capital, and 
talent. 
 
All entrepreneurs need help, even the entrepreneurs with the best ideas and 
the most potential to scale. They don’t have enough hours in the day to do 
everything that it takes to start a business. They have gaps in their 
experience. They need capital and mentoring and professional services.  
 
Rev1’s seasoned, data-driven team delivers a one-two punch of advanced 
venture advisory services and access to a continuum of investment capital 
managed by Rev1.  
 
-  Connected the region’s corporate and research base to launch more 
than $60MM of new capital (a 400% increase over the previous 3 years) 
 
-  Funded more than 47 companies, which is more Columbus startups 
funded than the previous 6 years combined.  
 
-  Served a portfolio that is both high-growth and filled with diverse 
leaders: 29% of the investments made in 2015 were to women or minority-led 
companies 
 
-  Created or retained more than 1096 jobs that pay an average annual 
salary of $74,000. 
    
OOOOUUUURRRR    SSSSTTTTRRRRAAAATTTTEEEEGGGGYYYY    
 
1.  The centerpiece of our strategy is our Backyard Effect to accelerate 
deal flow and deliver a continuum of early stage, seed, and seed+ capital.  
 
Rev 1 is the catalyst for bringing together the assets (mentoring, advising, 
capital, and first customers) in the region to benefit entrepreneurs and startup 
companies. We have built true collaborations with groups like Columbus 2020 
(regional economic development organization) and The Columbus 
 
 
Partnership (Group of the top 50 regional CEOs), as well as innovation 
partnerships. 
 
-  Through innovation partnerships with the Ohio State University, 
Nationwide Children’s, and OhioHealth, we have launched dedicated early 
stage investment funds with each entity, the most recent being Nationwide 
Children’s.  
 
In 2014, Rev1 made three investments in spinouts from these innovation 
partners. In 2015, we made thirteen – this equates to 46 percent of our 
engagements, 28 percent of our investments, and a 9X leverage on private 
investment. 
 
-  Seed Angels: Ohio TechAngels Funds is one of the largest angel funds 
in the US. We just launched the group’s fifth fund, OTAF V at $5MM. Angel 
investors provide more than money. The serve as mentors, advisors, and 
board members to our portfolio companies. 
 
-  Seed Plus: Corporate Sector: Columbus has more than 14 Fortune 1000 
companies. Rev1 developed an outreach strategy to land corporate investors 
into the Rev1 Fund, announced at $22MM. This fund allows us to increase the 
average size of our investment in Seed Stage Plus companies to $1,000,000.  
 
-  Opening doors to big corporations: Corporate partners want more than 
just to provide money. They want access to the innovation economy—from 
seeing disruptive technologies before they disrupt to providing their team 
new ways to get involved in the community. Some of these companies are 
also in the process of locating their innovation arms in our Rev1 Labs space. 
 
2.  We deliver comprehensive venture advisory services.  
 
-  Through our Concept Academy, we help entrepreneurs validate the 
market and their value proposition, making sure their ideas are sound. This 
helps create a firmer foundation for each new company and it is a way to 
identify early those concepts that do not demonstrate the potential to scale. 
 
-  The Ohio State University and Nationwide Children’s Hospital access 
federal grants, through sources such as the National Institutes of Health, to 
create new technologies. Turning more federally funded research into 
commercially viable products doesn’t happen on its own. It takes a dedicated 
 
 
support program to help a promising startup achieve the milestones it takes 
to get the business on a growth trajectory. 
 
-  We bring together mentors, experts, and advisors. Columbus is the 
most connected city in the Midwest. Our unique connections and 
collaborations giving startups direction and advise from those who have been 
there, leveraging the top minds in legal, accounting, HR, and more.  
 
Experts (90+) have delivered more than $2MM in discounted services. 
Advisors (120+) have donated more than 1500 hours of mentoring. 
 
-  Rev1 Labs is the place in Columbus for entrepreneurs to work. Currently, 
more than 50 portfolio companies are headquartered there, including nine 
OSU spinouts. Rev1 Labs companies leverage 12X more funding and 7X more 
expert services than comparable portfolio firms. 
  
3.  We help companies access talent.  
 
From customer service rep to CEO, help our portfolio companies find the 
specific talent they need to start successful companies.  
 
-  The Rev1 Jobs Board is specifically for startups to post open positions 
and for individuals who are seeking jobs in startups to post resumes or apply. 
We’ve helped companies fill more than 210 new jobs through 2015. 
 
-  Through our targeted senior leadership and succession plan, we have 
matched seven CEOs with seven portfolio companies. 
 
4.  We help companies access customers.  
 
Through our innovative First Connect program, we tie in our corporate base 
to provide feedback on products, serve as first beta customers and, 
ultimately, serve as first customers.  
 
We have connected more than 80 qualified opportunities and are on target to 
helping our portfolio close more than $1M in contracts through corporate 
partners.

Entrepreneurs need a lot of help. The private sector won’t bear 100 percent of 
the cost; so public sector has to invest. There is a dramatic gap in capital for 
startups outside of Silicone Valley, New York, Boston and Austin.  
 
As we’ve proven in Ohio through the Ohio Third Frontier Program (a state 
bond financed program that invests in start-up activities), there are proven 
ways that government can be a catalyst for new company start-ups and 
growth, by providing early stage capital that attracts matching capital from 
angels, VCs, and private corporations. 
 
The Federal Government has done this before with State Small Business 
Capital Incentives (SSBCI). That program helped regions raise capital they 
couldn’t otherwise get. SSBCI no long exists, but it’s something the federal 
government could explore doing again.  And recognizing the need for fiscal 
constraint, the Committee may be able to identify other underutilized 
resources within the Small Business Administration. 
 
If Congress were to pursue this type of program, Rev1 would suggest 
following best practices of states like Ohio, that include stringent metrics to 
ensure positive return on investment.  We might also suggest that rather than 
having the Small Business Administration run another program; it might be 
more effective to create a competitive grant process directed towards the 
states, which would encourage public-private collaboration and require 
private sector and local government matching funds to spur innovation.   
 
Previously I mentioned innovation in our region that is being derived through 
work partially funded through federal entities, such as the National Institutes 
of Health.  One consideration might be to explore encouraging federal 
agencies, when appropriate, to include some portion of their scoring process 
focused on commercialization of technology.  The idea being that we should 
maximize existing federal investments in research to incent development of 
new businesses.   
 
A few final thought on areas of federal policy this committee may wish to 
consider: 
   
•  Continue to evaluate and make less bureaucratic the FDA approval 
process for medical technologies.  An increasing number of our portfolio 
companies at Rev1 are start-ups from the biomedical sector. These companies 
 
 
face a unique set of challenges in garnering federal approval through the FDA 
before getting their products into clinical trials, and ultimately to the 
marketplace. 
 
•  Continue to monitor recent federal changes to the US Patent system.  
One of the biggest threats to entrepreneurs and those that invest in them is 
adequately protecting the intellectual property of start-up companies, and 
also continuing to make the process more streamlined.   
 
 
Chairman Coats, Vice Chairman Tiberi, Ranking Member Maloney and 
members of the Committee, thank you again for the opportunity to testify 
before you today.  I would happy to answer any questions you might have.

Still,WhiteCastle,alongwithrestaurants throughout thecountry, continues toencounter
theunchecked growthof regulatorybarriers andburdens whilefacingunprecedentedeconomic
challenges. Thesechallenges must be addressedinorderforrestaurants to grow. Weare
committedtoaddressingthosechallenges ina waythat enables us tocontinueservingour
customers withexcellence. But todothat effectively,weneedCongress to address ournation’s
growingbureaucracy.
Implementation of theAffordableCareAct
Underthelaw,WhiteCastleis subject totheSharedResponsibilityprovisionofthe
AffordableCare Act (ACA). Theemployermandate,as it is commonlyknown,requires
employers likeWhiteCastletooffertheir full-timeteam members, defined intheACAas those
employees working30hours ormoreperweek,healthcarecoveragethat is affordableandof
minimum value,orface potential penalties.
TheACA’s definitionoffull-timeemployment as 30hours perweekis not inlinewith
thetraditional full-timeemployment standardof40hours perweek. Manyemployees inour
industryarealreadylosingwages andhours, duetothelaw’s perverseincentives. This is
particularlytrue forpart-timeemployees who,until now,werethoseworkingbelowthe
traditional 40hours per week.
Datais alreadyavailable todemonstratethat theACAis incentivizingsomeemployers
tolimit thehours part-timeemployees canwork. Beyondprivate-sectoremployers, evensome
states, cities, counties, publicschools andcommunitycolleges aroundthe countryarebeing
forcedtolimit orreduce thehours part-timeemployees can work. Thesedecisions are
necessitatedbyaneconomicreality—that formanyemployers andemployees, it is not feasible
tobeareitherthecost of healthcarecoverageorthepenalties for failingtodoso.
Thelawis also incentivizingmanyemployees tocontinuetoworkpart-time.That’s due
inpart towhat’s knownintheinsuranceindustryas the“spousal exclusion”—meaningthat a
person who gets offered coveragethroughhis orheremployer will automaticallybekickedoff
theirspouse’s healthinsurance coverage. This spousal exclusionmakes it verydifficult for a
familytobe coveredunderoneplan andbenefit from thelowerfamilycoverage cost. Many
employees have raisedthis issuewiththeiremployers andhaverequestedtoremainas part-time
employees.

TheACAis leadingtosignificant workforce restructuring. Inthepast three years, the
proportionofpart-timeemployees workingjust below30hours aweekhas beenrising. At the
sametime,theproportionofthoseworkingjust over30hours a weekhas beendeclining. The
reason is simple: TheACA’s 30-hour,full-timedefinitionis nowforcingemployers and
employees aliketomake different choices tocomplywiththis newstandard.
Employers facetremendous potential financial liabilities undertheACA’s employer
penalties. As aresult,employers withvariable-hourworkforces andflexibleschedulingmust be
increasinglydeliberateabout thehours ouremployees work. That’s havinganegativeimpact
onourabilityto giveemployees thehours andschedules theyseek.
Oneoftheattractivebenefits foremployees inourindustryhadbeen flexiblescheduling.
Employees can changetheirhours tosuit theirpersonal needs and evenpickupadditional hours
toearnextraincomewhenneeded. Part-timejobs withflexibleschedulingarenot only
appealing,but oftencritical forstudents, singleparents, andotherindividuals strugglingto
balancevarious obligations andcommitments.
Harmonizingthedefinitionoffull-timeemployment intheACAwiththetraditional 40-
hour-per-weekdefinitionwouldbenefit employees, throughmorehours andincome. It would
also let employers focus ongrowingtheirbusiness andcreatingjobs, ratherthanontakingon
newadministrativeburdens andfindingways torestructuretheirworkforce. Aligningthe
ACA’s definitionoffull-timeemployment withthetraditional 40-hourstandardwouldhelp
avoidfurtherdisruptions toemployees’wages and hours, andprovidefinancial stabilityand
significant relief.
ForWhiteCastle,theuncertaintyofthelast several years associatedwiththehealthcare
lawinparticularhas impactedour abilitytocreate jobs byforcingus topostponeexpansion
plans intonewmarkets. Thegrowththat drives jobcreationinourindustryis put onhold,and
so arethejobs.
TheOvertimeRegulations
Whilebusinesses arestill workingtomanagethe ACAandits regulations, the
Department of Laborjust publishednewfinal Fair LaborStandards Act (FLSA) “overtime
regulations”that become effectivebeforethe end ofthe year. Theseovertimeregulatory
burdens onlyaddtothetremendous amount ofuncertaintythat new andexpandingfederal
regulations have created overthelast five years.
At thesametime,theovertimeregulations will haveanegativeimpact on many
employees that nowbenefit from themanyadvantages ofexempt status. Nonexempt employees
oftenhaveless workplaceautonomyandfeweropportunities forflexibleworkarrangements,
careertrainingandadvancement thantheir exempt counterparts. Inaddition,theFLSA’s rigid
rules withrespect toovertimepayalso makeit complicatedforemployers toprovidehourly
employees withcertainincentivepayandbonuses. Thus,inmanycases employees, whoare
reclassifiedorclassified as hourlyduetothis rule, mayloseimportant benefits and
opportunities.

Yet despitethebroadimpact,thetimeperiodallowedfor comments was inadequate for
aproper economic analysis. It wouldhavebeenhelpful fortheregulated communitytohave
hadmoretimetoreview andcomment ontheproposedrules. Indenyingthousands ofrequests
foranextension—from theU.S.Small Business AdministrationOfficeof Advocacyas well as
thousands ofemployers—the LaborDepartment saidit hadheldenough“listeningsessions”
withstakeholders priortopublishingtheproposedregulations. Theproposedchanges were
lengthyand complicated andaninsufficient time was allowedforthedata tobegathered and
analyzed.
Moreimportantly,the Department’s newminimum salarylevel is inappropriateforour
industryandmakes theovertimeexemptioninoperativeinmanyparts ofthecountry. The
Department claims thenewsalarylevel threshold will not excludefrom exemptionahigh
numberofemployees whomeet therequiredduties tests. Whenappliedtomyindustry,the
contraryis true. Theproposedrules arearadical departurefrom thetraditional formulausedto
set theminimum salary. Theynot onlydoublethe current salarytarget but also serveto
eliminatetheconsiderationofregional economies.
Most managers and crew supervisors inourindustrywouldnot meet thenewsalarylevel
of$47,476a year. Historically, akeypurposeof aset salarylevel has beentoprovideamethod
forscreeningout obviouslynonexempt employees. Inotherwords, thesalarythresholdshould
beset at alevel at which theemployees belowit wouldclearlynot meet aduties test. With
thesechanges, theDepartment is upendingthis historicrationaleand settingthesalarylevel at a
point at whichall employees abovethelinewould beexempt. This will greatlylimit the
numberofemployers intherestaurant industrywhoareabletousetheexemption.
Forexample,themedian annual basesalarypaidtocrew andshift supervisors inour
industryis $38,000. Eventhoseintheupperquartileat $47,000wouldberight at thethreshold
forexempt status undertheDepartment’s newsalarylevel. Likewise,the medianbasesalary
forrestaurant managers is $47,000,whilethelowerquartilestands at $39,000.
Theseemployees meet theduties tests but will becomenon-exempt underthenewsalary
level. It is clearthat,at least inreferencetotherestaurant industry(thenation’s second-largest
private-sectoremployer), thenewsalarylevel will excludefrom exemptionanunacceptably
high numberofemployees whomeet theduties tests. Theimpact wouldbemagnifiedinmany
regions ofthecountry.
Fortheemployee,a changetononexempt status canleadtofeweropportunities for
career advancement. Again,changingtononexempt status requires employers—and
employees—towatchthe clock. Forexample,employees whohavereachedorarenear40
hours ofworkinaweek mayneedtoskipadditional trainingorothercareer-enhancing
opportunities, becausetheemployeris not ableto payovertimerates forthat time.
Inourindustry,theproposedminimum salarylevel wouldrepresent anoutsizedincome
formid-level managers. Theseinclude assistant managers, sous chefs and otheremployees
learningthepositionand movingup. Theincrease wouldbetoolargeformanyemployers to

absorb,so thosepositions wouldendupbeingmovedbacktoanhourlyrate—aratethat would
net them theequivalent ofwhat theyearntodaywithovertimeaccountedfor. This maybean
easytransitiontomakefrom amanagement andbookkeepingstandpoint,but it removes akey
part ofthereason that exempt status was originallycreated—toencourage above-averagefringe
benefits, greaterjobsecurityandbetteropportunities foradvancement.
TheDepartment estimatedthat 75percent ofnewlyovertime-protectedemployees will
seenochangeincompensationandnochangeinhours workedbasedonthe newregulations.
However,intherestaurant industrysalariedemployees enjoyanumberof benefits not available
tohourlyemployees. Thus, inadditiontogettingpaidasalaryregardless ofthefact that they
maynot be workingover 40hours aweek,thesenewlyovertime-protected employees could
loseflexibilityas well as benefits, includingsubstantivebonuses, paidvacation,flex time,paid
holidays, andhealthinsurance.
Withregardtobonuses, undertheexistingrules, employers that provideincentive
payments tohourlyemployees must includethose payments intheemployees’“regularpay
rate” forpurposes ofcalculatingovertimepayrates, evenifthebonus is providedmonths after
theovertimetakes place. Facedwiththedifficult recalculationofovertime rates—sometimes
foreverypayperiodina year—employers oftensimplyforgotheseincentivepayments to
nonexempt employees ratherthanattempt toperform therequired calculations.
Finally,throughout its overtimeregulations, theDepartment createdtheimpressionthat
salariedemployees feel theyarebeingtaken advantageofbyvirtueoftheirexempt status. That
is farfrom thetruth. In reality, employees oftenviewreclassifications tonon-exempt status as
demotions, particularlywhereotheremployees withinthesamerestaurant continuetobe
exempt. Most employees viewtheirexempt status as asymbol oftheirsuccess withinour
industry.
Whenemployees havebeenreclassifiedfrom exempt tononexempt,thereis veryoftena
declineinemployeemorale,as this changeis generallyseen as aloss of“workplacestatus.”
Employees oftenbelieve theyarebeingpunished ordemoted,andsome evenlosetrust that their
employersees them as professionals. Inanindustrysurvey,fortyfivepercent ofretail and
restaurant managers believeachangeinemployment status from salariedto hourlywouldmake
them feel theyareworkingajobratherthanpursuinga career; 86%believetheirperceptions of
themselves as managers woulddeteriorateinsomeway.
Tomakematters worse,inthefinal regulationthe Department forthefirst time
announcedits plantoautomaticallyincreasethesalarylevel bypublishinganewthresholdin
theFederal Register—without anotice-and-comment period,without aRegulatoryFlexibility
Act analysis, andwithout anyoftheother regulatoryrequirements establishedbyvarious
ExecutiveOrders. Webelievethese automaticsalarylevel increases arenot onlyillegal but will
perpetuatebadpolicy.
Inshort,hourlypayand nonexempt status is appropriatefor certainjobs, but it is not
appropriate forall jobs; otherwise,therewouldbe noexemptions totheovertimepay
requirements.

TheCumulativeCostof theRegulatoryBurdens
Above, Ipresent merelytwoexamples onthewiderangeof federal laws andregulations
that hinderbusiness growth. Arecent studyfortheMercatus Centerat GeorgeMason
UniversitybyDukeUniversityeconomics professors BentleyCoffeyandPietroPerettofound
that thecumulativeeffects offederal regulations between1977 and2012createda considerable
dragontheeconomy. Theyfoundthat ifregulations hadbeenheldconstant at levels observed
in1980,theUS economywouldhavebeenabout 25percent largerthanit actuallywas as of
2012. This means that in2012,theeconomywas $4trillionsmallerthanitwouldhavebeenin
theabsenceofregulatorygrowthsince1980.
Thus,thereareplentyof additional examples outsideofthemajorhurdles createdbysome
oftherequirements oftheACAandthenewovertimeregulations. For example:
1) TheAmericanwithDisabilities Act (ADA)has noallowance foraviolationtobe
resolvedbeforeit literallybecomes a “federal case.” As theADAis currently
structured,aperson who alleges anADAviolationcanimmediatelyfilea complaint in
Federal Court without priornoticetothebusiness owner. Even aminorviolation—one
that abusiness wouldhavegladlyaddressed—cannowrequire abusiness topay
attorney’s fees and compensationtotheplaintiff.
2) ThenewOccupational SafetyandHealthAdministration(OSHA)recordkeepingrule
limits anemployer’s abilitytoconduct adrugtest post-accident. Testingis allowed,but
managers will first needto“determine”iftheybelievedtheaccident was causedbythe
presenceofdrugs. The mainreason foracross-the-boardtestingwas toeliminate
subjectivity.
3) TheEnvironmental ProtectionAgency’s (EPA)refrigerant bans arecostingbusinesses in
bothequipment andmaintenancebypushingnewrefrigerants whenthetechnologyis
not readilyandeconomicallyavailable. TheEPA changedrefrigerants inthe1990s,
againinthe2000s, andagaininthe2010s. Eachtime,theregulations have drivenupthe
cost ofdoingbusiness,insteadofwaitingfortheright technologytobe readyandthen
makingthe changes—savingeveryonemoney. The“Wedonot carewhat it costs”
attitudeis also hinderingbusiness growth.
Conclusion
As stated,restaurants run onnarrowmargins, and WhiteCastleis noexception. Inan
environment wherehard-workingAmericans arestill strugglingtomakeends meet,weare
facingrecord costs forlaborandfood—ourtwobiggest investments—and nowwearestaring
downthebarrel ofa widerangeofregulatorycosts. Beyondthedirect costs, thereis anequally

In closing, Iwouldliketostatethat wearenot against increasingtheovertimesalary
threshold,oragainst the ADA,OSHA,EPA,or regulations ingeneral. We understandthat
individual regulations sometimes haveabeneficial impact. However, regulations shouldmake
senseandencourageentrepreneurship,not just growthebureaucracy. Policymakers should
always considerthecumulativeimpact ofnew regulations andthepotential detrimental effect on
business growth,which, ultimately,wouldhave animpact onAmerican families andemployees.
Wearebothproudof andgrateful fortheresponsibilityofservingAmerica’s

Chairman Dan Coats, Ranking Member Carolyn Maloney, Vice Chair Pat Tiberi and 
distinguished members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to speak on behalf of the 
National Women’s Business Council before the Joint Economic Committee for today’s hearing 
titled Encouraging Entrepreneurship: Growing Business, Not Bureaucracy.  
 
My name is Carla Harris and I am the Presidentially-appointed Chair of the National Women’s 
Business Council (NWBC). The Council is a non-partisan federal advisory council created to 
serve as an independent source of advice and counsel to the U.S. Small Business Administration, 
Congress, and the White House on issues of impact and importance to women business owners, 
leaders, and entrepreneurs. The NWBC was established via the Women’s Business Ownership 
Act of 1988 (HR. 5050), a landmark piece of legislation that most notably eliminated individual 
state laws that required women to have a male relative cosign a business loan. We act as 
convener, collaborator, and councilor; it is our mission to be a resource, to put forth actionable 
policy recommendations, and then to engage and support influencers, stakeholders, and decision 
makers in the implementation.  
 
State of Women’s Entrepreneurship 
According to the most recent US Census Bureau’s Survey of Business Owners (SBO) there are 
over 27 million privately-held businesses in the United States. These firms generate $12 trillion 
in annual receipts and employ 56 million people.  
 
Women-owned firms represent an important segment of the business sector. As of 2012, women-
owned businesses comprised 36%, or nearly 10 million, of the country’s privately-held 
businesses. These firms generate over $1.4 trillion in sales and employ over eight million people. 
Between 2002 and 2012, the number of women-owned firms increased at a rate 2-1/2 times the 
national average (52% vs. 20%), employment in women-owned firms grew at a rate 4-1/2 times 
that of all firms (18% vs. just 4%), and the growth in revenues generated by women-owned firms 
paralleled that of all firms (up 51% compared to 48%).i  
 
Some of the most dynamic changes since the 2007 SBO can be witnessed for women of color, 
specifically Black and Latina women. For example, in 2007 there were about 900 thousand 
Black women-owned businesses; now they stand strong at over 1.5 million and represent almost 
60 percent of all Black owned businesses. Since 2007, Black women-owned firms have added 
over 71 thousand jobs to our economy while Black men-owned firms have added almost 11 
thousand jobs to the economy. Latina-owned businesses increased at even greater numbers. In 
2007, there were fewer than 800 thousand Latina-owned firms; now there are nearly 1.5 million.  
 
These numbers demonstrate that women-owned businesses are thriving, thanks to a combination 
of supportive initiatives and policies and a strong entrepreneurial spirit. However, inequities and 
disparities still exist that inhibit many women-owned businesses from reaching their full 
economic impact or scaling effectively. Women are behind, in earnings and receipts, and in the 
amount of venture capital and other forms of equity investment they receive. Women continue to 
lack access to some of the most crucial assets, capital and markets, necessary to launch and grow 
their businesses. All of us here today can agree that we want regulations as efficient and effective 
for our small businesses, including those that are women-owned, to continue to start, sustain and 
grow as a strong force in our economy.

We often describe our work at the National Women’s Business Council as divided among four 
pillars, which include: data collection and analysis; access to capital; access to markets; and job 
creation and growth. Commonsense regulation plays a role in each and any of these areas; today, 
I specifically focus on access to capital and job creation and growth, by describing how 
women—and others—stand to gain from full transparency in the area of marketplace lending, as 
well as minimized or consolidated regulation in the area of occupational licensing. Most 
importantly, however, we want to acknowledge the value of early and frequent involvement of 
women business owners, and all stakeholders, in developing and refining regulation.  
 
Women’s Access to Capital 
Access to capital continues to be a challenge for too many women. NWBC’s work focuses on 
changing the infrastructure, and on increasing and improving resources, so more women can 
access the capital they need to start and grow their businesses. Per Council research, on average, 
men start their businesses with nearly twice as much capital as women - $135,000 vs. $75,000. 
This disparity is slightly larger among firms with high-growth potential - $320,000 vs. $150,000; 
and it is much larger in the Top 25 firms - $1.3 million vs $210,000. Babson College has 
concluded the lack of sufficient capital funding for women entrepreneurs will cost the economy 
nearly six million jobs over the next five years, so it is in the best interest of the economy to 
understand any barriers to these firms’ success.ii 
 
Fortunately, the marketplace is responding to the challenges that women have faced in accessing 
capital, in the forms of both loans and equity investment. Thanks to great innovation in the 
capital space, with crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, microfinancing, and more, women have 
greater opportunities to pursue and raise the capital they need.  
 
Debt 
Beginning with an examination of debt, it is important to understand that women business 
owners take traditional business loans far less frequently than the overall population of business 
owners. Council research has found that women were more likely to be discouraged from 
applying for loans due to fear of denial, particularly during the financial crisis of 2008 to 2010. 
This research has also demonstrated that women are more likely to go to their community banks 
for assistance.iii Unfortunately, the growth of federal regulation presents challenges to 
community banks, threatening lending to small businesses. As a result, the U.S. Small Business 
Administration has introduced a pilot program, Community Advantage (CA), to meet the credit, 
management, and technical assistance needs of small businesses in underserved markets. The 
pilot program is scheduled to last until 2020 unless extended or made a permanent part of the 
SBA’s financial assistance programs. We believe that the Community Advantage program brings 
great value to women entrepreneurs.  
 
Beyond the Community Advantage Program, the SBA Microloan Program, which is the single 
largest source of funding for microfinance institutions in the U.S., provides direct funding to 
qualified community finance organizations, who then issue the loans to borrowers. Recall that 
one component of the Women’s Small Business Ownership Act of 2014 was to expand and 
improve the SBA Microloan Program to reach more women borrowers who need business loans 
of up to $50, 000. It would have also reauthorized the SBA Intermediary Lending program to 
3 
 
provide more women access to loans between $50,000 and $200,000, helping to fill this gap that 
is currently unmet by traditional private lending.  
 
Women entrepreneurs have historically been underserved by lending institutions, so these 
programs, as well as private marketplace lenders, are stepping in with capital and technical 
assistance, enabling stronger performance by these women’s businesses by increasing their 
available capital, including in the lower dollar values commonly sought by women business 
owners. According to a study done by ACCION, one of the largest microfinance institutions in 
the U.S., there are an estimated 13.1 million micro-entrepreneurs in the U.S., including 2.4 
million African-Americans and Hispanics.  
 
Women business owners—and all borrowers—must be able to meaningfully assess the risks and 
benefits associated with various loan options. Many private microfinance and marketplace 
lending programs already do an excellent job with transparency of loan terms; it is important that 
all marketplace lending institutions, across the board, make the terms transparent and accessible.  
 
Equity 
Women-owned businesses also continue to lag behind those owned by men in terms of equity 
investment. Research conducted by Babson College has found that of the nearly 7000 companies 
funded by venture capital between 2011 and 2013, only 2.7% of the companies had a woman as 
the CEO. When more than a third of all business is women-owned or women-led, and they 
receive less than three percent of the available venture capital, the flag is raised. Women stand to 
benefit greatly from a more balanced venture capital landscape.  
 
One hypothesis for the disparity in available equity is that the number of women in the upper 
echelons of investment firms is down – in 1999 it was at 10%; and as of 2014 only 6% of top 
management and investment firm partners are women.iv Venture capital firms with female 
partners are reportedly two and one half times more likely to invest in companies with women on 
the management team (34% vs. 13%).v Based on the argument that women investors would be 
more likely to invest in women entrepreneurs, an argument that merits further investigation, the 
declining number of women investors is a concern. 
 
We are pleased to see that women are establishing funds for women. Examples include: Golden 
Seeds– a woman-focused early investment fund; Astia – a nonprofit dedicated to identifying and 
supporting high-growth women entrepreneurs; and Texas Women Ventures – an investment firm 
giving millions to women entrepreneurs in Texas. Golden Seeds has invested over $70 million in 
more than 65 women-led businesses since 2005.vi And I am sure that you are all familiar with the 
Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program, a public-private partnership that helps 
meet the needs of small businesses administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The 
SBIC Program harnesses the talent of professional investment fund managers to identify and 
finance promising small businesses. From 2011 through 2015, 7% of the small businesses 
financed through SBIC were women-, minority- or veteran- owned. vii We know there is a focus 
to increase that percentage within these underserved populations and the Council is assisting to 
make sure women entrepreneurs are aware and leveraging this additional program.  
 
4 
 
The Council is committed to improving women business owners’ capital access through a 
multifaceted approach, involving all components of the entrepreneurship ecosystem, and 
recognizes the value of government involvement as stakeholders develop innovative solutions to 
address this gap.  
 
Occupational Certification 
One additional area of concern for the growth of small business—and, in particular, the growth 
of women-owned small businesses—is the constraint that occupational licensing often imposes 
on entrepreneurs seeking to launch their enterprises. Recently, the United States Bureau of Labor 
Statistics released figures on occupational licensing in the US, which revealed that over one in 
five American workers hold a government-issued occupational license. As identified by the 
White House in a recently released statement, while licensing is commonplace in high-earning 
fields, such as medicine or law, licensing is also “prevalent in services such as healthcare 
support, protective services, and personal care.viii”  
 
Women’s business ownership is strongest in the industries that comprise both personal care and 
healthcare support services. In other words, the industries in which women most frequently own 
businesses are also those areas strongly subjected to occupational licensing. There are, of course, 
important reasons to require licensure—we want to ensure consumers’ protection, just as we 
would like for qualified individuals to have a competitive edge. However, the cost associated 
with obtaining a license may serve as a barrier to women starting businesses in these industries, 
as well as their ability to hire qualified employees. Women business owners stand to benefit from 
resposible regulation that minimizes financial barriers to launching and growing enterprises. 
 
We encourage commonsense licensing requirements, echoing the Licensing Best Practices 
outlined by the White House in their report, “Occupational Licensing: A Framework for 
Policymakers,”  including the charge to “[m]inimize procedural burdens of acquiring a license, 
in terms of fees, complexity of requirements, processing time, and paperwork.ix”  
 
Further, we applaud the Department of Labor’s recently announced intent to award up to $7.5 
million to “one or a few national or regional organizations that will establish consortia of states 
to design and implement strategies that enhance the portability of occupational licenses and to 
otherwise reduce overly burdensome restrictions.x”  
 
Conclusion 
As the government’s only independent voice for women entrepreneurs, the Council’s mission is 
two-fold: to 1) support and conduct groundbreaking research that provides insight into women 
business enterprises from startup to success, and to 2) share the findings to ultimately incite 
constructive action and policies. The numbers confirm that the full economic participation of 
women and their success in business is critical to the continued economic recovery and job 
growth in this country, and we are committed to sustaining the potential that women 
entrepreneurs present. We believe that early and frequent involvement of women business 
owners in the development of business regulation is critical to developing strong and 
commonsense rules to promote and protect business ownership across our nation. 
 
Thank you for this opportunity to testify, and I look forward to your questions.

The Economic Burden Caused 
by Tax Code Complexity

Executive Summary
To pay taxes, the costs taxpayers actually incur are far greater than the net sums the government collects. Indi-
viduals and businesses as taxpayers must pay substantially more than $1 in order for government benefi ciaries to 
receive $1 of federal government services. Before individuals and businesses pay their tax liability (TB in Figure ES 
1), they must fi rst spend time collecting records, organizing fi les, and wading through the tax code (B in Figure ES 
1) to determine exactly what their tax liability is. In addition, individuals purchase products and services, such as 
tax soft ware or an accountant, to assist them in determining their tax liability. Th  ese are tax compliance outlays (C 
in Figure ES 1). Th  irdly, in eff ect, taxpayers must also pay the administrative costs needed to run the IRS etc., solely 
for tax collection purposes (D in Figure ES 1). Still there is more.
Businesses, large and small, hire teams of accountants, lawyers, and tax professionals to track, measure, and pay 
their taxes. Th  is tax infrastructure is also used to optimize the tax liability of the business. Individuals and busi-
nesses change their behavior in response to tax policies, hiring tax experts to discover ways to minimize their tax 
liabilities. Th  e effi  ciency costs from both legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion are diffi  cult to quantify, but 
could be the highest costs of all (A in Figure ES 1). 
Th  is is their story.
Th  is study creates a comprehensive estimate of the total administrative costs, time costs, and direct tax compli-
ance costs created by the complex U.S. federal income tax code. Th  is paper deals only with Segments B, C, D and 
E from Figure ES 1. One can only imagine what the full burden of government on the well-being of society might 
be. In our analysis we estimate that U.S. taxpayers pay $431.1 billion annually, or 30 percent of total income taxes 
collected, just to comply with and administer the U.S. income tax system.* Th  is cost estimate includes:
•  Approximately $31.5 billion in direct outlays (e.g. paying a professional tax preparer such as H&R Block or 
purchasing tax soft ware) (2010 data).
•  Total IRS administrative costs of $12.4 billion (2010 data). 
•  Th  e Taxpayer Advocacy Service of the IRS estimates that individuals and businesses also spent 6.1 billion 
hours complying with the fi ling requirements of the U.S. income tax code. We estimate the dollar value or cost 
of these hours to be $377.9 billion as of 2008. Th  e 6.1 billion hours number was estimated by multiplying 
the number of copies of each form fi led in tax year 2008 by the average amount of time the IRS estimated it 
took to complete the form. 
•  Individuals spent 3.16 billion hours complying with the income tax code, which weighted by time spent 
by income group, costs the U.S. economy $216.2 billion annually.
•  Businesses spent 2.94 billion complying with the business income tax code, which costs the U.S. econo-
my $161.7 billion.
•  Comprehensive audits also impose an additional taxpayer burden of at least $9.3 billion annually.  
* According to the IRS, total gross individual income tax collections in 2008 were $1.4 trillion; http://www.irs.gov/pub/
irs-soi/08db01co.xls. Although as of this writing total tax collections from 2010 are available, the detailed breakdown of 
income taxes paid by adjusted gross income are only available through 2008. For consistency, data on tax collections from 
2008 are used throughout this study.
People will also alter their work and leisure, savings and consumption, as well as their investments in response to 
tax incentives. Th  e estimated $431.1 billion in tax compliance costs does not include any of these behavioral changes 
that misallocate resources from their most economically-effi  cient uses toward their most tax-effi  cient uses. Nor do 
these costs account for the lost economic opportunities caused by the uncertainty and confusion of our complex tax 
code. Goodness knows what the costs would be if taxpayers’ pain and suff ering were included. Th  ink of how you feel 
when you go to your mailbox and there is a letter for you from the IRS.  
Th  is study also outlines what the potential benefi ts to economic growth could be from a reduction in tax com-
plexity. Large reductions in taxpayer compliance costs are more than feasible under comprehensive tax reform, 
namely a low rate fl at tax on a broad tax base. Th  e administrative costs, time costs, and compliance outlays resulting 
from a low rate broad based fl at tax would be substantially lower than they are today, while ineffi  ciencies caused by 
tax code complexity would be greatly reduced. As a result, overall economic effi  ciency would increase, capital and 
labor would fl ow to more highly valued uses, and the growth in income and wealth in the U.S. would increase sub-
stantially. Over 10 years, an increase in our annual economic growth rate between 0.45 percent (the low-end estimate

from a 50 percent reduction in tax complexity) and 0.9 percent (the high-end estimate from a 90 percent reduction 
in tax complexity) becomes signifi cant. By the 10th year, per capita incomes would be $2,800 to $6,000 higher. Not 
too shabby. 
Of course, higher economic growth by itself would raise tax revenues as well. Due to enhanced economic growth, 
over the entire 10-year period, increased tax revenues at current tax rates are between $650 billion and $1.4 trillion 
in net present value terms. For perspective, based on President Obama’s FY2012 budget, the estimated FY2011 net 
national debt is $10.9 trillion.* Th  e benefi t from reduced tax complexity would signifi cantly reduce our national 
debt. 
Government Overhead and Beneﬁ ciary Considerations
Th  e actual separation between the dollar taken away from the taxpayer and the dollar spent by the government is 
even further than the above analysis indicates. A complete accounting of the costs of administering any tax system 
must also include the money that the federal government must spend on overhead and other administrative costs to 
simply reallocate the resources from the tax collection process to the appropriate disbursement venue (F in Figure ES 
1). Th  ese allocation costs are present in any tax system; however such costs further increase the amount of money a 
taxpayer must pay in order to provide $1 of government services to the recipients.
And, while beyond the scope of the current analysis, even at the tail end of the process where benefi ciaries actu-
ally receive their benefi ts there are usually lots of hurdles the potential benefi ciaries must overcome to “qualify” for 
the money. As anyone who watched the FEMA fi asco following hurricane Katrina in New Orleans can tell you, quali-
fying costs can represent a signifi cant reduction in the value of government benefi ts.
Accounting for these costs to provide $1 of net government services, individuals and businesses must pay the $1 
plus their own time costs, the IRS administrative costs, government overhead costs, direct tax compliance outlays by 
individuals and businesses, effi  ciency costs, and the costs of qualifying.
And fi nally, there are the costs associated with changes in the behavior of government benefi ciaries. On a dynam-
ics basis this last cost may well have the greatest impact of all on economic growth. For the very existence of pay-
ments for people who don’t work or who otherwise use their time less productively is conceptually no diff erent than 
paying people to work or otherwise to use their time more productively. Th  e volume and effi  ciency of work can be 
impaired signifi cantly by how and to whom benefi ts are distributed. On the end of the spectrum—all the way to the 
other end—if government taxes work, output, and employment and pays people not to work and businesses not to 
produce, the country will end up with less work output and employment.
*According to the Ofﬁ ce of Management Budget, Historical Tables the “Gross Federal Debt” of the federal government in 2011 
is estimated to be $15.5 trillion. $4.6 trillion of this debt is estimated to be held by the federal government itself. The total debt 
held by the public—or the net national debt—is estimated to be $10.9 trillion. Total debt held by the public represents the out-
standing liability that the federal government must pay to someone else and represents the federal government’s actual ﬁ nancial 
liability. See the Ofﬁ ce of Management and Budget; http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals.

The Economic Burden Caused by Tax Code Complexity
Th  e “Patient Protection and Aff ordable Care Act” (ObamaCare), as passed, requires by 
law tucked away a footnote forcing all companies to submit a 1099 form to the IRS for all 
annual business-to-business transactions over $600. Attempting to raise an estimated $17.1 
billion in taxes, this mandate is the poster-child for the economic burden caused by the tax 
code. Th  e 1099 requirement covers all the basics of bureaucratic ineffi  ciency: increased time, 
administrative, and overhead costs, as well as uncertainty over future tax liabilities. Any 
revenue that this mandate could possibly raise will surely be accompanied by comparable 
compliance costs and effi  ciency losses. Th  e compliance costs to the private sector from the 
1099 mandate is but a drop in the bucket compared to the compliance costs associated with 
the full U.S. tax code. 
In the intense global race to attract factories, jobs, cutting edge technologies, and corpo-
rate headquarters, the winners are determined in part by the attractiveness of their econom-
ic environment. Th  e friendliness, or hostility, of a country to labor and capital as refl ected 
in its tax, regulatory, and legal environment play a key role in a business’ resource allocation 
decision. Among these, tax policy is one of the most important factors, directly impacting 
aft er-tax income, profi tability and return on invested capital. Many factors contribute to the 
total taxpayer cost of taxation in any particular country, one of which should not be the self-
infl icted and largely unproductive cost of complying with the tax system. 
Individuals and businesses can change the composition of their income, the location 
of their income, the timing of their income, and the volume of their income in order to 
minimize their tax liabilities. But each of these strategies to minimize tax liabilities comes 
at a cost. In order to be worthwhile for the individual, the costs can rise up to, but cannot 
exceed, the level of the tax savings. Th  e more complex a tax system is, the higher the com-
pliance costs will be. Higher compliance costs increase the returns from tax minimization 
strategies. It’s hard to range these costs, but they most likely represent a sizeable percent of 
the taxes the government actually collects. One thing is sure, the magnitude of the taxpayers’ 
actual cost is far greater than the net taxes the government collects.
Individual and business taxpayers must pay much more than $1 in order for government 
to receive $1 of tax revenues. Individuals and businesses must devote a signifi cant amount of 
time collecting records, organizing fi les, and wading through the tax code in order to deter-
mine their actual tax liability. Th  ey must also spend time to physically pay their taxes.
Taxpayers must also pay the administration costs of the IRS. Th  e greater the administra-
tion costs of the IRS, the higher taxes must be in order to provide $1 in net taxes. Th  ere is, in 
eff ect, an internal government tax collection wedge separating tax receipts from the govern-
ment’s usable funds. 
Still there is more. It has become commonplace for taxpayers to spend money, on prod-
ucts and services such as tax soft ware or an accountant, to assist them in determining their 
tax liability—tax compliance outlays. Th  ese tax compliance outlays are clearly undertaken 
for the sole purpose of paying taxes and would not exist otherwise. Our running total is 
now the actual $1 spent on the government service plus taxpayers’ time costs, government 
administrative overhead costs, and tax compliance outlays by individuals. Businesses face 
tax compliance costs as well. Businesses, large and small, hire teams of accountants, lawyers 
and tax professionals to track, measure, and pay their taxes. Th  is tax infrastructure is also 
used to optimize the tax liability of the business. Considering only the compliance aspect of 
the job, in order to provide $1 of government services the private sector must spend $1 plus

taxpayers’ time costs, government tax collection costs, and direct tax compliance outlays by 
individuals and businesses.
Finally, individuals and businesses change their behavior in response to tax policies.

of all. Accounting for these costs to provide $1 of government services, individuals and  tax collection costs, tax

and efﬁ ciency costs.
If the compliance costs for an income tax are minimal, then their impact on gross output 
will also be minimal. However, as is the case with the United States, when compliance costs 
compose 30 percent of the current tax receipts collected and these taxes are ineffi  ciently col-
lected, they represent a totally unproductive economic force that drives down the returns on 
labor and capital while producing no additional revenue for the government.
A reduction in the tax burden, including the cost of compliance, reduces the cost of do-
ing business in a country. Lower costs of doing business increase the demand for the now 
less-expensive goods and services produced within the country. Th  is higher demand will 
result in increased profi tability for businesses located within the country. Business failures 
will decrease in countries with declining relative tax burdens and business starts will rise. If 
all else remains the same, a reduction in the tax burden increases the return to capital and 
work eff ort, leading to increases in the supplies of capital and labor within the country.
Complex tax systems increase the costs of doing business and diminish the incentive to 
work, produce and invest. Th  e costs incurred by tax complexity are similar to the costs of 
actual taxes, burdening workers, savers, and investors, only without the tax revenues. Tax 
complexity, per se, is detrimental to a country’s economy and every individual adhering to 
the tax code. Th  e consequence of this “complexity tax” is a diminished ability to compete 
in the global economy. Th  e complexity tax is particularly problematic because it creates all 
of the negative incentives of a high tax burden, but nets the government no additional tax 
revenues.
We estimate that the annual compliance cost of the U.S. tax code for income taxes alone 
is approximately $431.1 billion.* Th  ese annual expenditures could be directed toward pro-
ductive activities, but are currently being wasted. Th  e growing tax complexity problem in 
*In the 2008 National Taxpayer Advocate Service’s (TAS) report to Congress, the TAS estimated that 
“U.S. taxpayers and businesses spend about 7.6 billion hours a year complying with the requirements 
of the Internal Revenue Code;” see (2008) “2008 Annual Report to Congress” National Taxpayer 
Advocate, Volume 1, December 31. Based on the estimated 7.6 billion hours we estimated the total 
annual compliance costs were $521.20.  Based on the 2010 TAS report to Congress, (2010) “2010 
Annual Report to Congress” National Taxpayer Advocate, Volume 1, “Most Serious Problems, #1,” the 
total estimated compliance hours fell to 6.1 billion hours. Even with this large reduction in compliance 
hours, our estimate for the total tax complexity costs remains excessively large.

the United States is literally “de-stimulating” the economy at the same time that the govern-
ment has spent hundreds of billions of dollars in an attempt to stimulate the economy. Be-
low, we illustrate the adverse economic impact on the U.S. economy caused by unnecessary 
tax code complexity. Our results indicate the enormous power tax simplifi cation would have 
on our tax-burdened economy.
And, while beyond the scope of the current analysis, the actual separation between the 
dollar taken away from the taxpayer and the dollar spent by the government is even larger 
than indicated above. A complete accounting of the costs of administering any tax system 
must also include the money that the federal government must spend on overhead and 
other administrative costs to simply reallocate the resources from the tax collection process 
to the appropriate disbursement venue. Th  ese allocation costs are present in any tax system; 
however such costs further increase the amount of money a taxpayer must pay in order to 
provide $1 of government services to the recipients.  
Even at the tail end of the process where benefi ciaries actually receive their benefi ts there 
are usually lots of hurdles the potential benefi ciaries must overcome or dollars recipients 
have to spend to “qualify” for government benefi ts. As anyone who watched the FEMA 
fi asco following hurricane Katrina in New Orleans can tell you, qualifying costs can repre-
sent a signifi cant reduction in the value of government benefi ts. As another example, to get 
unemployment benefi ts you do aft er all have to be unemployed. Th  at’s one heckuva cost to 
one and all.

discussion in no way suggests the lessening of its importance.”2
Consider the following facts from the IRS Taxpayer Advocate’s 2010 report to Congress, 
which again called tax complexity the number one problem facing taxpayers:3
•  In the last 10 years there have been approximately 4,428 tax code changes including 
an estimated 579 changes in 2010 alone.
•  As of an analysis in early 2010, the tax code contained 3.8 million words, which is 
dramatically higher than the 1.4 million words the tax code contained in 2001. 
Tax code complexity also negatively aff ects overall taxpayer compliance. Th  e tax gap 
is the amount of taxes the government believes it should have collected but didn’t and is 
viewed as a proxy for declining voluntary compliance with the tax code. Despite one hun-

dred thousand IRS workers employed to enforce the tax code with a 2010 budget of $12.4 
billion (Figure 1),4 the latest estimate of the tax gap was $345 billion (as of 2001).5

Th  e U.S. tax code is so complex that even experts disagree on the correct tax liability. Th  e 
“correct answer” to questions about the liability of any specifi c taxpayer is becoming diffi  -
cult to calculate. In 2002, the IRS help centers provided wrong answers to taxpayers 29 per-
cent of the time.6 According to the 2010 TAS report, “Despite the fact that about 90 percent 
of taxpayers rely on preparers or tax soft ware packages, the IRS received 110 million calls in 
each of the last two fi scal years. Th  at is a staggering number, and not surprisingly, the IRS 
was unable to answer more than 25 percent of them.”7
And, it is not just the IRS that does not understand the tax code. Because of the tax code’s 
complexity, even hiring a tax professional does not guarantee that your tax returns will be 
fi lled out correctly. In the 1990s, when the tax code was less complex than it is today, Money 
Magazine conducted an annual survey of professional tax preparers. In the 1996 survey, the 
magazine asked 45 diff erent professionals to prepare a tax return for the same hypothetical 
family. Th  e fi nancials for this hypothetical family were not simple—for instance, the husband 
received both self employment income and retirement income during the year—but not nec-
essarily uncommon for many families. Th  e details on the hypothetical family were:
[Curt Baker, the husband, made]… $30,831 in 1996. He also received a $60,000 lump-sum 
payout from his 401(k) when he retired. Ann, a lawyer, switched from one corporate job to 
another in ‘96. Her income for the year: $80,900. She also inherited $30,500 from her uncle. 
Th  e Bakers’ investments include a mix of stocks, bonds and mutual funds that threw off  
$21,298 in interest, dividends and capital gains. Th  e couple, whose joint income put them in 
the 36% tax bracket, own their own home, which they refi nanced in February 1996.8 
www.laff ercenter.com    9
Th  e 45 diff erent professional tax preparers estimated 45 diff erent tax liabilities that this 
hypothetical family would owe that ranged from $36,000 to $94,000. USA Today did a 
smaller survey in 2007 of only fi ve professionals asking these professionals to calculate a hy-
pothetical family’s tax bill. Consistent with the Money Magazine survey of the 1990s, each of 
the fi ve tax professionals provided diff erent personal income tax liabilities for the exact same 
family. USA Today’s commentary from their experiment says it all: “As the Tax Code turns 
ever more unwieldy, deciphering it has become more art than science…”9  
The Root Cause of Complexity 
Our tax system is  Our tax system is in part so complex because taxes are not levied simply to raise rev-
enues. Policymakers use tax policies to achieve other goals that are, ultimately, unrelated to

common approaches to fairness in taxation oft en confl ict”.11
Th  is desire to alter people’s behavior and advance social agendas pervades the tax code.  
For instance, as of 2008 the tax code had at least 11 diff erent education incentives and 16 
diff erent retirement incentives.12 To advance social and equality causes, the tax code now 
contains the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), 
numerous tax advantages for home ownership, as well as progressive tax rates. Each one of 
these provisions increases the complexity, and thus the compliance costs, associated with 
our tax code.
Complexity also arises because the tax code is an ever moving target—never stationary 
long enough to be understood. New amendments and changes to the tax code are made 
every year. Th  e last time Congress passed major tax simplifi cation was in 1986. In 2006, 
President’ Bush’s Commissioner of Internal Revenue testifi ed to Congress that “since the 
adoption of 1986 tax reform, Congress has passed 14,400 amendment to the tax code. Th  at’s 
an average of 2.9 changes for every single working day in the year for 19 years.13 Even as 
recently as last year, President Obama’s Commissioner of Internal Revenue said “Th  ere have 
been an astonishing 4,400 changes to the Code from 2000 to September [2010].”14 On aver-
age, this means one change per day for 10 years. 
Th  ese constant changes increase the overall complexity of the tax code. Also, federal tax laws 
sometimes confl ict with state tax laws, other federal laws (securities law, labor law, GAAP 
Accounting Standards), or even foreign tax treaties. Nothing is ever easy when it comes to 
the tax code.
Consequences of Tax Code Complexity 
As the analysis demonstrates below, tax complexity is diminishing the potential eco-
nomic growth of the U.S., Tax complexity as oft en as not works against the very groups and 
societal goals it intends to assist.15 Some criteria for judging the effi  ciency of a tax system 
were summarized by the 19th century American Economist Henry George:
10    The Laff er Center for Supply-Side Economics
Th  e best tax by which public revenues can be raised is evidently that which will closest con-
form to the following conditions:
1.  Th  at it bear as lightly as possible upon production—so as least to check the increase of 
the general fund from which taxes must be paid and the community maintained.
2.  Th  at it be easily and cheaply collected, and fall as directly as may be upon the ultimate 
payers—so as to take from the people as little as possible in addition to what it yields 
the government.
3.  Th  at it be certain—so as to give the least opportunity for tyranny or corruption on the 
part of offi  cials, and the least temptation to lawbreaking and evasion on the part of the 
taxpayers.
4.  Th  at it bear equally—so as to give no citizen an advantage or put any at a disadvan-
tage, as compared with others.16 
Complex tax systems violate all four of Henry George’s principles. Complex tax systems 
impose large burdens on taxpayers in excess of their tax liability, thus violating the fi rst two 
principles. Complex tax codes also create opportunities for individuals to hide their taxable 
income in ways that may or may not be legal. As Krause (2000) illustrates, tax “complexity 
undermines the IRS’s ability to distinguish among intentional evasion, honest misinterpre-
tation of the tax code, and legitimate tax avoidance.”17 Th  erefore, tax complexity violates 
principle three. Complex tax codes contain provisions that favor one constituency over 
another. For instance, our current tax system off ers a tax break to homeowners but not to 
renters. As a consequence, a homeowner can pay less tax than a renter even if both indi-
viduals earn the exact same income and face the exact same expenses. Complex tax systems, 
therefore, violate principle four, which is also referred to as horizontal equity or the notion 
that the tax system should treat similar taxpayers in a similar manner.
Th  e President’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform found evidence that the complex-
ity of the current U.S. tax code actually hurts low-income individuals as opposed to helping 
them.18 For instance, low-income individuals must fi le tax returns in order to receive the 
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) payments, but, nearly three-fourths of the families claim-
ing an EITC had to hire a tax preparer in order to receive their payments because the EITC 
is one of the most complex parts of the tax code.19
A 2001 study by the Joint Committee on Taxation identifi ed four adverse consequences 
from tax complexity:
•  Decreased levels of voluntary compliance,
•  Increased cost for taxpayers,
•  Reduced perception of fairness, and
•  Increased diffi  culties in tax administration.20 
Other organizations have also expressed concern. For instance, according to the Ameri-
can Institute of Certifi ed Public Accountants (AICPA), “many tax professionals believe that 
signifi cant simplifi cation is needed to ensure the continued viability of our self-assessment 
approach.”21 
www.laff ercenter.com    11
Th  e AICPA illustrates how tax complexity undermines the principles of a sound tax sys-
tem. Specifi cally, excessive tax complexity erodes the following principles:
“Equity and fairness: Complexity contributes to public perceptions that the tax law is 
unfair. 
Certainty: Complexity due to constant change and lags in administrative guidance 
heighten taxpayer uncertainty. 
Economy of collection: Complexity increases the costs of tax administration, including the 
costs associated with collecting taxes, examining returns, and resolving disputes. 
Neutrality: Complexity may cause similarly-situated taxpayers to pay diff erent amounts 
of tax. 
Economic growth and effi  ciency: Complexity diverts resources from productive activities 
and investments to excessive and nonproductive compliance costs. 
Transparency and visibility: Complexity leaves taxpayers perplexed about how the tax 
law applies to them and others. 
Minimum tax gap: Complexity increases the size of the tax gap by making taxpayers less 
willing and able to comply. Th  e tax gap is the diff erence between taxes that are owed and 
taxes that are voluntarily paid.”22 
Both the actual tax burden and the costs associated with tax complexity diminish the 
aft er-tax returns to work, savings, and investment. Oft en, tax complexity and the size of the 
tax burden will go hand in hand. As a result, we can apply our understanding of the impact 
on the economy from the tax burden to create an estimate of the economic costs created by 
tax complexity. Th  e negative economic consequences from excessive taxation arise because 
taxes create a wedge between what it costs to hire a worker (invest) and how much that 
worker receives (investment returns). A tax wedge occurs anytime there is a separation of 
eff ort and reward. It is intrinsically an economic variable that operates at the margin where 
incentives come into play and the decisions are made to, say, allocate capital between one 
project and another or work one more hour. Consequently, understanding the economic im-
pact of the tax wedge provides the proper framework in which to assess the economic costs 
created by the complexity of our tax system.
SECTION II: THE MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF TAX WEDGES
The essential tenet of  Th  e adverse economic impact created by tax wedges begins with the basic tenets of clas-
classical economic  sical economics. Th  e essential tenet of classical economic analysis is that people alter their 
behavior when economic incentives change. If the incentives for doing an activity increase 
analysis is that people 
relative to the incentives for doing alternative activities, more of the now more attractive 
alter their behavior 
activity will be done. Likewise, if impediments are imposed upon an activity, less of the now 
when economic 
diminished-incentive activity will be forthcoming. Basically, people have both time and 
incentives change.
resource constraints. With limited resources and time, the explicit attainment of objectives 
necessitates prudent management within the structure of constraints imposed by nature 
and man. Th  us, government, with its full power of enforcement, has the ability to alter the 
constraints aff ecting economic factors. Changes in the structure of these governmentally 
imposed constraints alter the economy’s behavior.
12    The Laff er Center for Supply-Side Economics
Firms base their decisions to employ workers or acquire capital assets, in part, on the 
total cost to the fi rm of employing workers or acquiring capital, always with an eye to en-
hancing the value of the fi rm. Holding all else equal, the greater the cost of employing each 
worker, the fewer workers the fi rm will employ. Conversely, the lower the cost per worker, 
the more workers the fi rm hires. Incorporated in the decision making process are all costs 
associated with each worker’s employment, including payroll taxes and fringe benefi ts. For 
the fi rm, the decision to employ is based upon gross wages paid, a concept which encom-
passes all costs borne by the fi rm.
In a Wall Street Journal editorial, Michael Fleisher, President of Bogen Communications

of this economic environment.
A life in business is fi lled with uncertainties, but I can be quite sure that every time I hire 
someone my obligations to the government go up. From where I sit, the government’s mes-
sage is unmistakable: Creating a new job carries a punishing price.23  
A similar set of criteria can be applied when contemplating whether or not to acquire 
capital. Again, from the perspective of the fi rm, the explicit objective is to create surplus 
value from each decision by choosing investments whose returns exceed the cost of capital. 
Th  e tax wedge reduces return and thus reduces the number of attractive investment oppor-
tunities.
Th  e worker and the saver, on the other hand, care little about the cost of either employ-
ing a new worker or acquiring new capital. Th  e worker’s primary concern is how much he 
receives for providing his work eff ort, net of all deductions and taxes. Conversely, the savers 
abstain from consuming in order to earn an aft er tax return on that savings. Within the 
classical framework, workers concentrate on net wages received, while savers are preoccu-
pied with their yields aft er tax. Th  e greater net wages received, the more willing the worker 
is to work; the higher the net yield on savings, the greater total savings will be. Conversely, if 
net wages received fall, workers will fi nd work eff ort less attractive and they will do less of it.  
Savers will also save less if the net yield to savings declines.
Th  e diff erence between what it costs a fi rm to employ a worker or acquire a unit of capi-
tal, and what that worker or saver receives net, is the tax wedge (Figure 2). From the stand-
point of a single worker or a single unit of capital, an increase in the wedge has two eff ects.  
An increase in the wedge raises the cost to the employer in the form of higher wages paid 
for workers or higher costs paid for capital. Clearly, fi rms will employ fewer workers and 
acquire less capital. On the supply side, an increase in the wedge reduces net wages received 
and the net yields savers receive. Again, less work and savings will be supplied.

In sum, an increase in the wedge reduces the demand for, and the supply of productive 
factors. An increase in the wedge, therefore, is associated with less employment, less invest-
ment and lower output. In dynamic formulations, as the wedge grows, output growth falls, 
and vice versa. Within the context of classical economics, regulations, and restrictions, along 
with explicit taxes, are all parts of the wedge. Th  is is the theoretical foundation to our em-
pirical assessment of the costs imposed on the U.S. economy from excessive tax complexity.
Th  e government fi nances itself in diff erent ways leading to various estimates of the tax 
wedge created by our current tax system. On the most general level, the U.S. federal govern-
ment can fi nance its spending by imposing a tax on people working today. Alternatively, 
if the federal government is running a budget defi cit then only a portion of the spending 
is fi nanced by taxes on people working today. Th  e remainder of this spending is fi nanced 
by shift ing resources from the future into the present. Th  is defi cit spending is empowering 
current workers to levy a tax on future workers—some of which will still be current workers 
(i.e., the younger current workers) while others will not (i.e., the older current workers).  
As a consequence, the broadest measure of the total tax burden being created by the gov-
ernment is the government tax and expenditure wedge.* Th  is wedge measures the total value 
of the current government taxes on current and future workers (total current federal, state and 
local government spending) relative to the private sector’s current ability to fi nance that spend-
ing. Th  e private sector’s ability to fi nance that spending is the value of the production of all 
private businesses—an approximation of the private business contribution to GDP.
*The government tax and expenditure wedge is deﬁ ned as the cost of government relative to the size 
of the private sector economy. The size of the private sector economy is based on the production of 
all businesses in the domestic economy—or net domestic business income adjusted for inﬂ ation. The 
cost of government is deﬁ ned as total federal, state and local government expenditures. The govern-
ment tax and expenditure wedge is calculated by dividing total government expenditures by net 
domestic business output.  
This measure of the tax wedge is a measure of the average tax burden. While an accurate measure 
of the marginal tax burden is ideal, in practice accurately measuring the marginal tax burden is 
difﬁ cult. However, when the total costs of the tax system are above the cost minimizing level, as they 
are in our current tax system, the marginal costs of the system will be higher than average costs—the 
further above the cost minimizing level, the greater marginal costs will be over average costs. As a 
consequence, our calculations based on the average cost burden will likely understate the estimated 
economic impacts based on the marginal costs.
14    The Laff er Center for Supply-Side Economics
As of 2009, total government expenditures were $5.0 trillion.24 Th  e value of the produc-
tion of all businesses (corporate and non-corporate income adjusted for depreciation) for 
2009 was $9.0 trillion.25 Dividing the value of the production of all businesses in 2009 ($9.0 
trillion) by the total government expenditures ($5.0 trillion) results in the government tax 
and expenditure wedge for 2009 of 55.2 percent (numbers do not add due to rounding).  
Figure 3 tracks the growth in this government tax and expenditure wedge between 
1950 and 2009 (the latest full data set available). Figure 3 also labels the sub-periods where 
changes in the path of the government tax and expenditure wedge are evident. Total govern-
ment expenditures were relatively fl at to slightly growing between 1950 and 1961. 
Between 1961 and 1965 (the Kennedy era) the slight growth in expenditures that had 
been occurring since 1950 was arrested for fi ve years. Beginning in 1966, there is a dramatic 
change in the rate of expenditure growth that continued until 1983. Th  e growth in govern-
ment expenditures then slowed until 1989. A renewed, but short-lived, pick-up in govern-
ment expenditures occurred between 1989 and 1993. Th  e trend toward lower government 
expenditures then resumed until 2001, following which there has been a renewed increase 
in total government expenditures.

Table 1 summarizes the primary negative impact that a high and growing government 
tax and expenditure wedge has on private sector activity, as well as the positive impact of a 
lower and declining tax and expenditure wedge. Of course, missing from these data are the 
indirect costs born by the private sector that have never been collected via taxes past, pres-
ent, or future. Table 1 combines the 1950-1965 and 1983-2000 eras in order to create three 
relatively similar time periods in which to judge the relationship between the government 
tax and expenditure wedge and economic growth. We break out the noteworthy sub-peri-
ods as sub-bullets.

•  During the fi rst period (1950-1965) the government tax and expenditure wedge is 
relatively low (32.5% in 1965) and growing slowly (rose 5.5 percentage points during 
the entire period). Total business output (adjusted for infl ation) grew, on average, 3.5 
percent per year during this period.
•  During the 1961 to 1965 period the relatively low government tax and expen-
diture wedge fell 0.9 percentage points and total business output adjusted for 
infl ation grew, on average, 5.8 percent per year during this period.  
•  In the second period (1966-1982), the government tax and expenditure wedge grew 
robustly by 16.5 percentage points to 49.0 percent by 1982. Total business output 
(adjusted for infl ation) grew a much slower 2.2 percent per year.
•  In the third period (1983-2000) the government tax and expenditure wedge fell by 
7.4 percentage points ending at a low of 41.5 percent in 2000. Total business output 
(adjusted for infl ation) grew a robust 3.9 percent per year during this period.
•  Following the full implementation of the Reagan tax cuts in 1983 the tax and 
expenditure wedge fell 3.3 percentage points and total business output adjusted 
for infl ation grew, on average, 5.0 percent per year during this period.

Since 2000, the government tax and expenditure wedge has once again been on the rise. 
As expected, average real business output growth has been only 1.9 percent per year. One 
can conclude that during periods of a growing government tax and expenditure wedge the 
growth in the private sector is below average. During the periods when the government tax 
and expenditure wedge was either low or declining, growth in the private sector is above 
average. Below we provide a more rigorous analysis that provides further support for this 
relationship.
SECTION III: ESTIMATING THE TOTAL COMPLEXITY COSTS CREATED BY THE 
U.S. TAX SYSTEM
Th  e total government tax and expenditure wedge is an accurate proxy for the total cur-
rent and future tax burden on the private sector. But, these fi gures do not address the ad-
ditional negative impact created by the tax code’s complexity.
16    The Laff er Center for Supply-Side Economics
Th  e fi rst step to estimating the complexity tax wedge is a defi nition of the dollar payments 
(including the monetary value of time). Remember that this wedge only estimates the impact 
from the federal income tax system and as such is a lower-end estimate of the total complexity 
burden. Th  e total tax burden can be broken down into four categories: actual tax payments, 
government administration costs, compliance costs and effi  ciency costs.
Th  e most straightforward portion of the total tax burden is the actual tax payments made 
by taxpayers. In the wedge model of Section II we use total government spending as the mea-
sure of all current and future tax liabilities created by government actions.*
Also straightforward are the administration costs of the income tax system—the cost to 
physically administer the IRS. Figure 1 illustrated that these costs have been steadily growing 
since 1980 and were $12.4 billion in 2010. Of course, total tax revenues collected by the IRS 
have also been growing. As a result the administrative costs relative to total tax collections 
have been fairly constant. Between 1980 and 2009 total administrative costs have been around 
$0.48 per $100 collected; and a lower $0.45 per $100 collected between 2000 and 2010, see 
Figure 4. Th  e collection costs relative to tax collections in 2009 and 2010 rose signifi cantly 
due to the large drop in total tax collections caused by the national recession.

Th  e last two components of the tax burden are the compliance costs—the cost a taxpayer 
incurs in order to pay his or her taxes—and the effi  ciency costs—the lost economic opportu-
nities resulting from the complexity of the tax code. Th  ese components directly measure the 
economic costs created by the overly-complex tax system.
*These costs do not include an important future tax cost looming on the ﬁ nancial horizon. The U.S. government 
has promised to make payments to individuals in the future without having either the current resources or future 
taxes in place to pay for these promises (unfunded liabilities). Unfunded liabilities include things like Social Se-
curity, Medicare, retirement beneﬁ ts for federal employees, as well as the explicit backing given to the Pension 
Beneﬁ t Guarantee Corporation and Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac. While some of these obligations, such as the cost 
to backing Fannie Mae or the ultimate costs from ObamaCare, are not known, the known unfunded liabilities 
already total over $65 trillion—every household in the U.S. today owes $557,745 due to the current federal 
unfunded liabilities. And, this does not even include the unfunded liabilities of state and local governments.

Many studies have directly measured the compliance costs associated with our complex 
tax system. Compliance costs measure the time spent conforming to the tax system and the 
actual dollars spent complying with the tax system, which include the cost of hiring tax pre-
parers and the purchase of computer soft ware. As we mentioned earlier, the effi  ciency costs 
that occur due to taxpayers changing their behavior in response to tax complexity are not 
included in this analysis, but may actually be the largest economic impact of all.
With respect to the actual dollars spent complying with the tax code, the National 
Taxpayers Union estimates that total out of pocket costs are approximately $31.5 billion 
annually as of April 15, 2010.26 Th  ese costs include the 60 percent of individuals who pay a 
professional tax preparer to assist in fi ling their taxes compared to 38 percent of individuals 
who paid a professional in 1980.27 An additional 29 percent buy tax soft ware to help them 
complete their taxes.28 A vast majority of Americans now must spend money in order to fi le 
their income taxes as a direct result of the large and growing complexity of the income tax 
code.
With respect to the time spent complying with the tax code, the IRS Taxpayer Advocate cal-
culated in 2010 that individuals and businesses spent 6.1 billion hours a year complying with 
the fi ling requirements of the U.S. income tax code as of 2008.29 Th  e IRS Taxpayer advocate 
“arrived at this estimate by multiplying the number of copies of each form fi led in tax year 
2008 by the average amount of time the IRS estimated it took to complete the form.”30 And, 
“that fi gure does not even include the millions of additional hours that taxpayers must spend 
when they are required to respond to an IRS notice or an audit … If tax compliance were an 
industry, it would be one of the largest in the United States. To consume 6.1 billion hours, the 
‘tax industry’ requires the equivalent of more than 3.0 million full-time workers.”31
David Keating of the National Taxpayers Union provides a perspective on the hours we 
dedicate to complying with the U.S. income tax code. As of 2009, the income tax industry 
employs “... more workers than are employed at the fi ve biggest employers among Fortune 
500 companies—more than all the workers at Wal-Mart Stores, United Parcel Service, Mc-
Donald’s, International Business Machines, and Citigroup combined.”32 
As we all know, time is money. Estimates of the dollar value on all these hours vary by re-
searcher depending upon the estimated hourly rate that is used. Based on the average hourly 
cost of a civilian employee, the IRS Taxpayer Advocate Service “… estimates that the costs of 
complying with the individual and corporate income tax requirements in 2008 amounted to 
$163 billion—or a staggering 11 percent of aggregate income tax receipts.”33
While the IRS estimated compliance costs are excessively high already, higher income 
individuals pay the majority of federal income taxes; see Figure 5, thus skewing the tax com-
plexity burden considerably. Th  e IRS estimates do not adequately account for the payment 
biases and, consequently, underestimates the value of the compliance costs.
Figure 5 illustrates that in 2008 the top 1 percent of income earners paid 38.0 percent of 
all federal taxes and the top 5 percent paid nearly 58.7 percent. Th  e share of income taxes 
paid by these groups has been growing over time despite the fact that the top marginal 
tax rate—the rate these individuals pay—has changed over this period.34 For instance, in 
1980, the top tax rate was 70 percent. Today, the top rate is 35 percent. Compare the share 
of income taxes paid by the top 1 percent and 5 percent of income earners to the income 
taxes paid by the entire bottom half of income earners. As of 2008, the bottom 50 percent of 
income earners paid less than 3 percent of total income taxes.

1986 tax reform the data before and after 1986 may not be strictly comparable. 
http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/250.html
Not only do the top income earners pay the majority of federal income taxes, their share 
of the income tax burden is disproportionate to their share of income. In 2008 the top 1 per-
cent of taxpayers earned 20 percent of total AGI but paid 38 percent of total federal income 
taxes. Th  e top 5 percent of taxpayers earned 34.7 percent of total Adjusted Gross Income 
(AGI) but paid 58.7 percent of total federal income taxes. Th  e bottom 50 percent of income 
earners, on the other hand, earned 12.8 percent of total AGI but paid only 2.7 percent of 
total federal income taxes.
Th  e data also illustrate that higher income taxpayers spend more time and resources 
complying with the tax code, and face greater tax complexities. Consequently, the value of 
the hours spent complying with the tax code should account for the skewed nature of the tax 
complexity burden, which the IRS estimate presented above does not adequately consider. 
As we demonstrate below, a more realistic valuation of time value creates a larger estimated 
compliance burden—around twice as much. Additionally, the estimated burdens above do 
not include the time and costs created by IRS audits, which we estimate separately.  Below, 
we estimate the hourly value of time spent complying with the tax code for both individuals 
and businesses. Total compliance costs can be estimated by including the direct dollar costs of 
complying with the tax code, along with a proxy we estimate for the additional costs of audits.
Individual Income Tax Compliance Costs
To calculate a weighted average hourly cost for tax compliance we relied on two major 
data sources. First, we used data from the IRS Table 1.1—Selected Income and Tax Items, by 
Size and Accumulated Size of Adjusted Gross Income, Tax Year 2008.35 Th  ese data, detailed 
in Table A-1 in the Appendix, summarize total tax returns fi led by Adjusted Gross Income 
(AGI). Th  e second major source was based on Guyton et.al (2003) and provides estimates 
for total hours spent on tax compliance sorted by AGI.36 Table A-2 in the Appendix is repro-
duced from Guyton et.al.
www.laff ercenter.com    19
Combining the hours per return in Table A-2 with the number of returns in Table A-1, 
we calculated the total number of hours spent complying with the tax code by AGI.37 Th  ese 
values are summarized in Table A-3. Using the mid-point for each AGI category as the 
dollar value of AGI in each category ($50 million was used as a proxy for the top category) 
the total weighted dollar value of compliance costs can be calculated by multiplying each 
categories number of hours by the average wage. Th  e results of this calculation are presented 
in Table 2.
Table 2
Weighted Average Dollar Value of Time Spent 
Complying with the Tax Code 
Dollar Value of Hours 
Spent in Compliance
Weighted Average Hourly Income $68.42
Weighted Average Annual Income $136,839.71 
One additional adjustment to the above calculation has been made. AGI is less than 
total market wages. Th  e Bureau of Economic Analysis tracks total personal income minus 
government transfer payments, which is a proxy for total earned income of residents in the 
U.S. In 2004, the latest data available, total personal income minus government transfer 
payments was 23 percent higher than total AGI.38 Th  e $68.42 hourly value ($137 thousand 
annual value) of time uses this 23 percent scalar applied to AGI.
Th  e weighted average income calculated in Table 2 is signifi cantly higher than the me-
dian income fi gure that the IRS estimate cited above relies upon. However, as we illustrated 
above, the bottom half of income fi lers only paid less than 3 percent of the tax revenues. Th  e 
median income of the U.S. is, consequently, not representative of the average income of the 
average taxpayer. Based on this higher value of income, these results indicate that the 3.16 
billion hours spent complying with the individual tax code have a value of $216.2 billion.
Business Income Tax Compliance Costs
Th  e IRS has estimated that the total time spent complying with the U.S. tax code is 
estimated to be 6.1 billion hours. Because individuals spend 3.16 billion hours complying 
with the individual income tax code, the balance—2.94 billion hours—is spent by businesses 
complying with the tax code. Th  ese hours are valued at $55 per hour, based on a weighted 
average salary for a tax accountant, with bonuses and benefi ts, of $102,184.50.39 Includ-
ing the employer portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes, the total annual costs per 
tax accountant is a bit more than $110 thousand a year, or $55 per hour. Based on a rate of 
$55 per hour and a total of 2.94 billion hours, a total of $161.7 billion is spent by businesses 
complying with the tax code.
Total Income Tax Compliance Costs
Adding together these estimates, the value of the time that individuals and business 
spend complying with the tax code, not including any direct expenditure, is a total of $377.9 
billion. Th  is equates to a blended hourly rate of $61.95. Including the estimated direct out-
lays of $31.5 billion and the administrative costs of the IRS of $12.4 billion, the total annual 
costs that U.S. taxpayers must endure to pay their Federal income taxes are $421.8 billion – 
again this estimate only includes the federal income tax compliance costs.
20    The Laff er Center for Supply-Side Economics
But, what about audit costs? Tax audits vary in complexity ranging from a letter asking 
for further explanation about certain items on a tax return to the Taxpayer Compliance 
Measurement Program (TCMP), which is the IRS’s most comprehensive tax audit. Accord-
ing to the IRS Data book, 1 percent of taxable tax returns were examined in 2008.40 Also, the 
chances of an audit for higher income taxpayers are higher than the chances of an audit for 
lower income taxpayers.41
Table A-4 in the Appendix presents the examination coverage rates from the 2010 IRS 
Data Book.42 Based on these data and the total number of returns fi led by AGI we can 
estimate the total number of audits by AGI class. Relying on the same hourly estimate per 
return—assuming an audit requires a doubling of the fi ling eff ort of the taxpayer—taxpayer 
audits in 2010 added an additional taxpayer burden of $9.3 billion.

estimate the underground economy’s size at $1 trillion or higher.”43 Th  is $1 trillion repre-
sents a substantial amount of potential revenues. During the entire post-WWII period, total  is $431.1 billion.
federal tax revenues have been around 19 percent to 20 percent of GDP even though the 
highest tax rates and the number of income tax brackets have fl uctuated dramatically. W. 
Kurt Hauser and David Ranson (Hauser, 1993 and Ranson, 2010) go so far as to argue that 
this level of taxation in the U.S. (19.5% of GDP) will hold regardless of the tax rates or other 
tax changes—what they term Hauser’s law. In 2009 total federal tax revenues were 15.6 
percent of GDP, signifi cantly below this historic rate. Using this historically low average tax 
collection number, if the underground economy were taxed, then the federal government 
would gain at least an additional $156.1 billion in tax revenues. 
SECTION IV: APPLYING THE TAX WEDGE LESSONS TO TAX COMPLEXITY
While some level of compliance costs are a necessary evil, the evidence presented above 
describes an income tax system that is excessively complex. To estimate the potential gain 
from simplifying our current income tax system, we relate the complexity tax burden (the 
government tax and expenditure wedge) to its impact on the growth of Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) adjusted for infl ation. Th  e government tax and expenditure wedge dis-
cussed in Section II should have a negative impact on GDP growth (i.e., when the tax and 
expenditure wedge grows, economic growth should weaken).
One common predictor of economic growth is the slope of the yield curve.44 As the 
yield curve becomes fl atter (short-term interest rates approach long-term rates), the market 
is predicting slower economic growth in the future, and vice versa when it steepens. Th  e 
steepness of the yield curve can be measured by subtracting the annual federal funds rate 
from the annual rate on a 10-year treasury bond. Th  is variable predicts the rate of economic 
growth in the following year. A large positive value (steep yield curve) in the current year 
should be followed by strong GDP growth in the next year.
www.laff ercenter.com    21
A negative relationship between economic downturns and the relative size of government 
spending is also expected. Th  e government expenditure wedge should increase during eco-
nomic downturns due to decreased private sector growth and constant (or even increased) 
government spending. Because of this relationship, the government expenditure wedge 
should be expected to increase during economic downturns (a negative relationship).  We 
control for this expected negative relationship by incorporating a recession variable (what is 
called a dummy variable) into the analysis.
Table 3 displays a simple model relating the slope of the yield curve, the recession 
variable, and the government tax and expenditure wedge to economic growth. Th  e results 
confi rm our expectations.

Th  e fi rst row in Table 3 provides the statistical relationship between the tax and expen-
diture wedge and GDP growth. Th  e second column (the Coeffi  cient) is negative; indicating 
that a higher tax and expenditure wedge reduces GDP growth or alternatively that a lower 
tax and expenditure wedge encourages GDP growth.45 Th  is is consistent with what we ex-
pected a priori. Th  e next three columns indicate that the negative relationship between the 
tax and expenditure wedge and GDP growth is statistically signifi cant.
Th  e second row in Table 3 provides the same information with respect to the steepness 
of the yield curve in the prior year (Slope (-1)). In this case, the second column (the Coef-
fi cient) is positive; indicating that when the yield curve is steep, GDP growth is strong and 
when the yield curve is fl at or inverted (when short-term rates are higher than long-term 
rates), GDP growth is slow or declining. Th  is is also consistent with what we expected a 
priori. Th  e next three columns indicate that the positive relationship between the slope of 
the yield curve in the prior year and GDP growth is statistically signifi cant.
Th  e third row in Table 3 provides the same information for the recession variable. When 
the economy is in a recession real GDP growth is lower, which conforms to the common 
defi nition of a recession. Th  e next three columns illustrate that this relationship is statisti-
cally signifi cant. Notably, when the impact of a recession is taken into account, the tax and 
expenditure wedge still has a statistically signifi cant negative relationship to changes in real 
GDP growth.
22    The Laff er Center for Supply-Side Economics
Th  e next two rows in Table 3 provide basic data on a constant and techniques used to 
correct for autocorrelation in the data (which if not corrected reduces the accuracy of the 
results). Finally, the last 3 rows have information about the overall equation. Th  ese values 
illustrate that the estimated equation has the power to explain the observed changes in GDP, 
resolving the aforementioned problem.
Using the coeffi  cient from Table 3 and the current government expenditure level, every 
$100 billion reduction in the compliance costs tax burden will increase economic growth 
(GDP growth adjusted for infl ation) between 0.21 percent and 0.24 percent annually or be-
tween $30 billion and $34 billion. Many other studies have confi rmed this negative relation-
ship between government spending and economic growth including: Barro (1991), Gwart-
ney, Lawson, and Holcombe (1998), Laff er (1971), Laff er (1979), Landau (1983), Mitchell 
(2005), and Scully (2006).
Halving our current estimated compliance costs of $431.1 billion would increase total 
annual economic growth between 0.45 percent and 0.52 percent. A 90 percent drop in 
compliance costs, equal to a $388 billion reduction in tax complexity,46 would increase GDP 
growth between 0.8 percent and 0.9 percent.
Between 1950 and 2009, the compound annual growth rate in real GDP was 3.2 percent. 
If the tax complexity burden were cut in half, the historical average annual growth rate of 
3.2 percent would increase to between 3.65 percent and 3.72 percent. Over 10 years, the U.S. 
economy would become approximately $870 billion to $1.0 trillion larger, see Figure 6. Th  e

Of course, higher economic growth benefi ts tax revenues as well. Due to the enhanced 
economic growth, the discounted present value of the increased tax revenues at current 
rates over the entire 10-year period is between $650 billion and $740 billion for a 50 per-
cent reduction in tax complexity and between $1.2 trillion and $1.4 trillion for a 90 percent 
reduction in tax complexity. For perspective, the estimated FY2010 national debt is $10.9 
trillion.

Figure 6 
Yearly Increase in Economic Growth Due to Reduced Tax Complexity 
Relating these fi gures to the $780 billion stimulus program the Obama Administration 
and Congress passed in February 2009, a total of $623 billion in grants, loans, entitlements 
and tax rebates had been spent through February 18, 2011.47 Research by Christina Romer 
(Chair, President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors) and Jared Bernstein (Vice Presi-
dent Joe Biden’s Chief Economist) estimated that for every $1 of the stimulus package, $1.60 
in economic activity will be created.48 Based on this arithmetic, the Obama Administration 
was hoping that the stimulus money already spent should have boosted GDP by over $997 
billion over two years.
Disregarding the debate about whether the stimulus is actually having a positive impact 
on GDP, a 50 percent reduction in tax complexity reduces costs on taxpayers by $216 billion. 
Reducing tax complexity can have an impact on the economy that is similar to the desired 
stimulus package and this stimulus package would occur on an annual basis without reduc-
ing any government revenues and without requiring any new government spending program. 
Consequently, eff orts at curtailing tax complexity have the potential to signifi cantly impact 
total economic activity in the U.S.
HOW TO REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY BURDEN
Much of the complexity of the current tax code centers on the defi nition of income. 
Consequently, the signifi cant reductions in complexity discussed above could not likely be 
achieved without comprehensive tax reform, like a fl at tax or a national sales tax. A properly 
designed fl at income tax or a national sales tax would simplify the defi nition of income and 
curtail complexity.
For a fl at tax there should be only one tax rate for all taxpayers, and it should apply to the 
fi rst dollar of income earned. Income thresholds, while well intentioned, introduce a signifi -
cant amount of complexity into a fl at tax system. Also, a fl at income tax should minimize all 
exclusions and deductions and have a simple defi nition of income. An appropriately struc-
tured fl at tax creates signifi cant pro-growth incentives for the economy while eliminating 
unnecessary complexity.
24    The Laff er Center for Supply-Side Economics
Similar to the fl at income tax, the national sales tax should be designed so that there 
is only one true fl at tax rate. Th  e defi nitions of income and exemptions are automatically 
eliminated under a national sales tax because income is no longer taxed, consumption is. 
Th  erefore, all of the complexities regarding income and expense defi nitions disappear. A 
national sales tax also reduces complexity by limiting the number of residents that actually 
need to physically interact with the tax collectors—only fi nal providers of newly produced 
goods and services. 
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
While some compliance time is necessary under any tax system, reducing the annual 
compliance costs of our tax system provides an eff ective stimulus to our economy that 
recurs each and every year without the need for federal government spending. Th  e benefi ts 
from such a boost would be greater income and job growth for all Americans.
Th  e potential benefi ts to reducing tax complexity go beyond the dollar impact as well. 
As the AICPA has noted, the U.S. income tax system relies on taxpayers to self-report their 
income—the system only works if most taxpayers view the outcomes as fair and accu-
rately self-report their income. As such, excessive tax complexity is undermining the very 
foundations of our current tax code. Ultimately, what we do about complexity is a political 
and social issue. Th  is study is intended only to calculate the direct and measurable costs of 
complexity; it does not, for instance, guess at the economic benefi t which would fl ow from 
improved allocation of capital undistorted by tax considerations.  
Th  e bottom line of tax complexity is as simple as our current tax code is complex: sim-
plifying the tax code should be a top priority. Regardless of the reform approach taken, the 
U.S. economy will be enhanced greatly by signifi cantly reducing the complexity of the cur-
rent tax code. In a time of global economic competition the U.S. cannot aff ord the luxury of 
a Byzantine tax system. LC

(RAS) have advised us that the lower burden estimates likely reﬂ ect efﬁ ciency gains attributable to wider use of tax software, particularly by higher 
income business taxpayers. However, these efﬁ ciency gains have not necessarily reduced the burden on middle income and lower income taxpay-
ers. Indeed, measured by dollars, RAS estimates that the mean burden has declined but the median burden has increased. RAS cannot independently 
determine the margin of error of existing estimates, and RAS acknowledges that the reduction in the time burden estimates may be at least partially 
attributable to measurement error.”

Before the Joint Economic Committee
 
“The Economic Consequences of Tax Complexity”
Thank you Chairman Coats and Ranking Member Maloney for the opportunity to talk 
with you today about the tax code’s complexity and its impact on the economy.
Anyone who has studied federal tax law or has tried to prepare their own taxes knows 
that the U.S. tax code is a mind-numbingly complex document. 
Over the last century, the federal tax code has expanded dramatically in size and 
scope. In 1955, the Internal Revenue Code stood at 409,000 words in length. Since 
then, it has grown to a total of 2.4 million words: almost six times as long as it was in 
1955 and almost twice its length in 1985.
However, the tax statutes passed by Congress are only the tip of the iceberg, when 
it comes to tax complexity. There are roughly 7.7 million words of tax regulations, 
promulgated by the IRS over the last century, which clarify how the U.S. tax statutes 
work in practice. On top of that, there are almost 60,000 pages of tax-related case 
law, which are indispensable for accountants and tax lawyers trying to figure out how 
much their clients actually owe.
Tax complexity creates real costs for American households and businesses, starting 
with just the time it take us to comply with the tax code. The National Taxpayer 
Advocate estimates that Americans spend over 6 billion hours complying with tax 
filing requirements, equal to more than 3 million full-time workers doing nothing but

Tax complexity, and the fear of making mistakes, motivates about 62 percent of all taxpayers 
to use tax return preparers, but the percentage climbs to about 73 percent for the poorest 
Americans claiming the EITC.4
But tax complexity creates other costs as well, besides our time. Specifically, many of the 
most complex features of the tax code distort individual and business behavior in numerous 
ways that leads to long-run economic harm. And we can measure that economic harm using 
the Tax Foundation’s Taxes and Growth (TAG) Macroeconomic Tax Model. 
To illustrate the tax code’s harmful economic effects, I’ve selected a number of examples 
from the Tax Foundation’s forthcoming Options for Reforming America’s Tax Code. The Options 
book will contain nearly 100 specific policy changes to the individual and corporate tax 
code that have been scored with the TAG model. Each “Option” will include an estimate of 
the policy’s economic effects (such as on GDP, wages, and jobs), revenue effects (measured 
conventionally and dynamically), and the distributional effects (also measured conventionally 
and dynamically). 
The Individual Income Tax
I’ll begin with the individual income tax code, which is filled with dozens of credits, 
deductions, limitations and other special provisions that make life more complex for 
American taxpayers.
Much of the complexity in our tax code results from our attempts to make the system 
progressive, insuring that as taxpayer’s income rise, so too does their tax liability. Over the 
decades, lawmakers have attempted numerous ways of making the tax system progressive, 
overtly with graduated tax brackets and subtlety with back-door claw backs. 
Progressive Tax Rates
Before the 1986 Tax Reform Act, a married couple was faced with 15 separate tax brackets 
as high as 50 percent. During the 1970s, those couples face as many as 26 different brackets 
as high as 70 percent. A taxpayer claiming Head of Household status faced 34 brackets as 
high as 70 percent. 
Today, the tax code has seven brackets, with rates of 10, 15, 25, 28, 33, 35, and 39.6 
percent. In many ways, this makes no sense because progressivity can be accomplished with 
as few as two rates—zero and 15 percent, for example.

Naturally, those paying at the 15 percent rate would pay a greater share of their income in 
taxes than those paying at the zero rate. We know too that marginal tax rates matter. When 
the “tax price” of earning the next dollar of income gets too high, people will stop working to 
earn that extra dollar. Economists have referred to these as “success taxes.”5
To illustrate the economic benefits of simplifying the progressive tax bracket structure, 
we consolidated the current bracket structure into three of 10, 25, and 35 percent. The 
TAG model estimates that this simplification would boost the long-run level of GDP by 1.4 
percent, lift after-tax incomes by an average of 3 percent, and create the full-time equivalent 
of more than 1.1 million jobs.  
PEP and Pease
Recognizing that statutory tax rates matter, lawmakers have often turned instead to 
backdoor efforts to raise additional taxes from higher-income households. Two particular tax 
code provisions stand out as overly complex attempts to increase taxes on the wealthy: the 
Pease limitation on itemized deductions and the personal exemption phase-out (PEP).
The Pease limitation on itemized deductions reduces the value of a taxpayer’s itemized 
deductions by three cents for every additional dollar of income they earn. While the Pease 
limitation is framed as a limit on itemized deductions, it actually resembles a marginal surtax 
on high-income taxpayers, with a top rate of 1.188 percent. As a result, repealing the Pease 
limitation would not only make the tax code less complex, but would increase long-run GDP 
by 0.3 percent, by removing disincentives on work and investment, and create the equivalent 
of 187,000 jobs.
Similarly, PEP reduces the value of the personal exemption for upper-middle income 
households. Because each additional dollar that these households earn leads to a smaller 
personal exemption, PEP is essentially equivalent to a marginal surtax of at least 1 percent. 
Repealing PEP would increase long-run GDP by 0.1 percent, by lowing marginal tax rates on 
upper-middle income households, and would create the equivalent of 87,000 jobs.
The Earned Income Tax Credit
At the other end of the spectrum, lawmakers’ well-intended attempts to use tax policy 
to help the working poor has not only added vast complexity, but unintentionally added 
features that can discourage poor people from working more as their incomes rise. A good 
example is the way in which the Earned Income Tax Credit phases out as a worker’s income 
increases. Consider this another hidden success tax.
5  Gentry, William H. & R. Glenn Hubbard (2004). Success Taxes, Entrepreneurial Entry and Innovation, NBER Working Paper No. 
w10551.

The EITC calculation formula includes four different phase-in rates, four phase-out rates, 
and different calculations based on filing status and number of children. It is no surprise that 
Americans made 219,122 math errors when calculating the EITC in 2014, or that the credit 
had an improper payment rate of between 22 and 26 percent in 2013.6
The complex structure of the EITC has the ironic effect of encouraging more work as the 
subsidy phases-in, but then it discourages work effort as the subsidy phases out by levying 
high marginal tax rates on households just over the poverty line. When a married household 
with two children begins to earn more than $23,630, the EITC starts to phase out at a rate 
of 21.06 percent. This high phase-out rate has the perverse effect of penalizing a worker for 
every dollar they earn above the poverty line, thus discouraging that extra work effort. 
We can measure the macroeconomic cost of this phase-out penalty by substituting a 
different phase-out rate. For example, if we substitute a uniform 10 percent phase-out rate 
for the EITC for the current 21.06 percent phase-out rate, the TAG model finds that this 
would reduce the penalizing marginal tax rate effect on working households, thus increasing 
long-run GDP by 0.1 percent, raising the after-tax incomes of the working poor by more than 
1 percent, and creating 164,000 jobs.
Itemized Deductions
For middle-income households, one of the most complex areas of the tax code is itemized 
deductions. Only 30 percent of taxpayers choose to itemize their deductions, but it is likely 
that many other households devote significant time and energy determining whether it 
would be advantageous or not to itemize.
Certainly, one way to reduce the complexity of itemized deductions is to simply eliminate 
many of these deductions from the tax code. However, simply eliminating itemized 
deductions alone could actually produce harmful macroeconomic effects, as this would bump 
some taxpayers into higher brackets, increasing their marginal tax rates, and discouraging 
work and investment.
For example, the TAG model indicates that the marginal rate effects of simply eliminating all 
itemized deductions except for the charitable and mortgage interest deductions would lead 
to a long-term reduction in GDP of 0.4 percent and the loss of 290,000 jobs. 
Swap itemized deductions for lower rates. However, if the additional revenue from 
eliminating those same itemized deductions were then used to cut every income tax rate by 
10 percent, this would increase long-run GDP by 0.6 percent and create 577,000 jobs.7

Administration, The Internal Revenue Service Fiscal Year 2013 Improper Payment Reporting Continues to Not Comply With the Improper 
Payments Elimination and Recovery Act, 2014, https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2014reports/201440027fr.pdf.
7  For this example, it was necessary to eliminate the AMT because the loss of so many itemized deductions threw many taxpayers 
into the AMT. 
5
Double the standard deduction. Another way of simplifying the tax code while reducing 
reliance on itemized deductions is to expand the standard deduction. A larger standard 
deduction would mean that fewer taxpayers would feel the need to keep detailed records of 
their expenses and fill out Schedule A.
A larger standard deduction could be economically beneficial, by bumping many households 
into lower marginal rates. The TAG model shows that doubling the standard deduction for 
all households would increase long-run GDP by 0.5 percent and create 463,000 full-time 
equivalent jobs. 
Estate and Gift Taxes
Another unduly complicated area of the tax code aimed at stemming income inequality is 
the federal estate and gift tax. Albeit a minor source of federal revenues—it collected $19 
billion in 2014, just 0.6 percent of federal receipts—it has outsized economic effects because 
it strongly depresses capital formation relative to the modest amount it collects. Some have 
estimated that just the costs associated with complying with the estate tax exceed the 
revenue it generates. 
Advocates say that it impacts very few estates since the first $5.45 million of gifts and 
bequests is excluded from tax, and the amount is indexed for inflation. Thus, they say, it 
has minimal economic effect. However, critics say that by making it harder to pass family 
businesses and farms to the next generation, the estate tax is yet another “success tax.”
We find that eliminating the federal estate and gift tax would increase long-run GDP by 0.8 
percent, lift the stock of private business capital (e.g., equipment, structures) by 2.3 percent, 
boost wages by 0.7 percent, and create for 159,000 new jobs.
Business Income Taxes
It is now well known that the U.S. has the highest corporate income tax among the leading 
industrialized nations. Indeed, Tax Foundation economists determined that the U.S. has the 
third highest corporate income tax among the 165 nations we surveyed. Only Chad and the 
United Arab Emirates levied a higher corporate tax rate than the U.S. 
Economists at the OECD determined that the corporate income tax is the most harmful tax 
a national can impose. Individual income taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes were found to 
be less harmful. 
One way of measuring the economic effects of our high corporate tax rate is simply to lower 
the rate in our TAG model. For example, the model shows that cutting the corporate tax rate 
to 25 percent from 35 percent (with no offsets) would boost the long-term level of GDP by 
2.3 percent, increase wages by 1.9 percent, and create 443,000 jobs. 
6
Aside from our uncompetitive corporate tax rate, there are many complex elements of the 
corporate code that have harmful effects too. We can estimate those costs as well. 
Cost Recovery
Under the current tax code, when a business makes a capital investment, it required to 
deduct the cost of the asset over time, according to one of over a dozen depreciation 
schedules. These schedules are essentially arbitrary, and the process of determining how to 
properly depreciate an asset is complex.
One tax code change that could make the tax code both less complex and more favorable 
to investment is moving to full expensing of capital investment. Allowing businesses to 
deduct the full cost of their investments immediately would encourage significantly higher 
investment levels.8
According to the TAG model, full expensing would increase long-run level of GDP by 5.4 
percent, by growing the nation’s capital stock by 16 percent, increasing wages by 4.5 
percent, and creating more than 1 million full-time equivalent jobs.
Dollar-for-dollar, full expensing is one of the most pro-growth tax changes that Congress 
could enact.
Corporate Integration
Another complex feature of the business tax code is that firms face significantly different tax 
regimes depending on their legal form. For instance, traditional C-corporations typically face 
a much higher marginal tax burden than partnerships because corporate income is tax twice, 
first at the entity level at 35 percent, and then at the shareholder level when capital gains 
and dividends are taxed at rates as high as 24 percent. Partnership and S-corporation income 
is taxed only once when the profits are distributed to the owner. 
Over the past few decades, there have been several notable proposals to equalize the 
tax treatment of all businesses, regardless of their legal form or financing method. This 
approach is known as corporate integration, and it would vastly simplify the taxation of U.S. 
businesses. Under corporate integration, companies would no longer have to spend time and 
resources determining what legal form to adopt or planning tax-efficient financing strategies.
Recently, the Tax Foundation modeled a version of corporate integration that would allow 
corporations to deduct dividends paid and would tax dividends received by individuals 
at ordinary income rates. In addition to greatly simplifying the business tax code, such a 
proposal would increase U.S. GDP by 2.9 percent over the long run, boost wages by 2.5 
percent, and create 535,000 jobs.

nber.org/papers/w21876

Business Tax Expenditures
There are roughly 80 so-called tax expenditures in the corporate tax code, with a budgetary 
value of more than $120 billion. It’s often thought that businesses and the economy would 
be better off if all of those tax breaks were eliminated in exchange for a lower corporate 
tax rate. However, our research has found that eliminating all business tax expenditures in 
exchange for a lower tax rate would actually negate the expected growth from the rate cut 
itself.9
The reason for this is that a number of corporate tax provisions—such as accelerated 
depreciation and the expensing of research and development costs—help move the tax code 
towards a more neutral treatment of capital investment. Eliminating these cost-recovery 
provisions raises the cost of capital and, thus, neutralizes any of the economic benefits of a 
lower tax rate.
However, there are many other tax preferences—such as energy credits, or interest 
exclusions on bonds—that could be eliminated with minimal economic harm, and provide 
revenue for overall rate cuts.
For instance, eliminating all business tax expenditures that are not connected to cost 
recovery would raise enough revenue to cut the overall corporate tax rate to 28 percent. 
This combination of changes would increase the size of the U.S. economy by 1.4 percent in 
the long run and create 275,000 jobs. Moreover, the new economic growth would actually 
increase federal revenues by more than $550 billion over a decade.
International Taxation
Perhaps the most complex aspect of the U.S. tax code is the treatment of income earned 
overseas. Under current law, U.S. multinational corporations are required to pay tax on their 
worldwide income. If a corporation earns income in England, it is required to pay tax to Her 
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. As long as that company keeps those profits overseas, it 
can defer the additional payment of U.S. tax. Once that corporation decides to bring that 
income back to the United States, it is required to pay tax again to the U.S. government at 
35 percent, minus a foreign tax credit.
Major complexities arise for multinational corporations operating abroad. The foreign 
tax credit, which prevents double-taxation of foreign profits, is littered with rules and 
exceptions. It includes strict rules limiting how much a company can claim in foreign taxes. In 
addition, the foreign tax credit has complicated rules determining what taxes that businesses 
pay overseas can be credited against U.S. tax liability. In the past, the IRS has used these 
rules to deny foreign tax credits to multinational corporations. This leads businesses to go to 
court against the IRS, costing time and resources.

Most nations do not require this level of complexity. Instead, they have territorial tax 
systems, which only require domestic multinationals to pay tax to the countries in which 
they conduct their business. These systems make the foreign tax credit rules unnecessary 
and eliminate much of the complexities of our worldwide system.
Tax Foundation economists are currently developing an extension of our TAG model to 
measure the economic and revenue effects of moving to a territorial tax system. 
Replacing the Corporate Income Tax with a Value-Added Tax
Considering the complexity and economic harm caused by the corporate income tax, it 
makes sense to ask “what if it was replaced by a tax that was less damaging?” As a thought 
experiment, and we don’t necessarily advocate this policy, Tax Foundation economists 
modeled the effects of replacing the corporate income tax with a Value Added Tax (VAT). 
A value-added tax is a consumption tax, levied at the business level on all profits and payroll. 
Unlike the current corporate income tax, value-added taxes are generally broad-based and 
simple, and they contain no bias against saving and investment. 
There are two ways to administer a value-added tax. Under a credit-invoice method, 
businesses pay VAT on their gross sales and receive a credit for value-added taxes previously 
paid on their business inputs. Under a subtraction method, businesses calculate their VAT 
base by subtracting their operating expenses and capital expenditures from their revenues.
Replacing the corporate income tax with a 5 percent value-added tax would eliminate many 
of the complexities in the current tax code and leave federal revenues roughly unchanged, 
as measured on a conventional basis. According to the TAG model, by eliminating the double 
taxation of saving and investment in the current corporate tax code, this swap would raise 
long-run GDP by 5.8 percent, create 532,000 jobs, and actually raise $1.8 trillion in new 
revenue after accounting for the economic growth effects.
Again, this is not necessarily a policy we would endorse, but two presidential candidates 
proposed tax reform plans that included such a tax swap so it is a policy that should be 
taken seriously. 
Lessons from Modeling Tax Reform Plans
Over the past year, Tax Foundation economists have gained special insights into what kind of 
tax policies boost investment, wages, jobs, and economic growth, and which policies lead to 
less of those things. 
9
Using our Taxes and Growth (TAG) Macroeconomic Tax Model, we have scored the tax plans 
of every presidential candidate10, as well as numerous tax plans developed by members of 
the House and Senate. For example, we have modeled the plans of two members of this 
committee, Senator Lee’s Lee-Rubio tax plan and Senator Cruz’s tax plan, as well as Senator 
Ben Cardin’s Progressive Consumption Tax plan and the business tax reform plan designed 
by Congressman Devin Nunes.
During this experience, we have modeled every conceivable tax reform plan one can think 
of, including the Flat Tax, FairTax, Bradford X-Tax, Value Added Tax (VAT), and numerous 
plans that incorporate features of each of these. 
To one degree or another, the more pro-growth of these plans incorporate many of the 
lessons that I’ve outlined in the first portion of this testimony: they reduce marginal tax 
rates; reduce taxes on capital; reduce or eliminate the double-taxation of savings and 
investment; and, move toward a neutral or consumption tax base. 
Here are four examples:
Senator Ben Cardin’s Progressive Consumption Tax11
Senator Ben Cardin’s proposal would dramatically scale back the individual and corporate 
income taxes. Because the plan would exempt a couple’s first $100,000 of wages from the 
income tax, most people would no longer owe the individual income tax. Incomes above that 
amount would be subject to rates of 15, 25, and 28 percent. The corporate income tax rate 
would be cut to 17 percent.
The Cardin plan is intended to be revenue neutral. He would finance this with a value added 
tax, which he calls the Progressive Consumption Tax (PCT). Large rebates would make the 
overall package progressive.
At a PCT tax rate of 10 percent, the TAG model estimates that in the long run the plan would 
raise the level of gross domestic product (GDP) by 4.4 percent, increase the stock of capital 
used in production by 15.2 percent, and boost the number of jobs by 1.1 million.
Ben Carson’s Flat Tax12
During his presidential bid, Dr. Ben Carson proposed to replace the current federal income 
tax (both individual and corporate) with a Hall-Rabushka-style flat tax. The plan would tax 
all wage income and business income at 14.9 percent, but exempt taxes on capital gains, 
dividends, and interest income at the individual level.

Businesses would be allowed to fully expense capital investment, but would no longer be 
able to deduct interest expenses. The plan would also eliminate all itemized deductions and 
all tax credits except for the foreign tax credit. The plan would further expand the tax base 
by including fringe benefits, such as employer-provided health insurance, in the tax base.
Our analysis found that the plan would reduce federal revenues by $2.5 trillion over the 
next decade. However, it also would improve incentives to work and invest, which would 
increase gross domestic product (GDP) by 16 percent over the long term if the tax cuts were 
appropriately financed. This increase in GDP would translate into 10.9 percent higher wages 
and 5.2 million new full-time equivalent jobs. 
The Lee-Rubio Tax Reform Plan13
In March 2014, Senators Mike Lee and Marco Rubio introduced a comprehensive tax 
reform plan. While the plan has attracted a great deal of attention for its generous child 
tax credits, the structure of the plan incorporates the core planks of David Bradford’s 
“X-Tax,” or progressive consumption tax.14 The Lee-Rubio plan achieves this by cutting both 
corporate and passthrough business tax rates to 25 percent, moving to full expensing for all 
capital investment, eliminating the second layer of corporate taxation by repealing taxes on 
dividends and capital gains, and moving to a full territorial tax system. For individuals, the 
plan taxes wages at rates of 15 and 35 percent.
According to the Tax Policy Center, these measures reduce the marginal effective tax rate 
on new investment to zero. The Tax Foundation’s model estimates that the Rubio plan would 
boost the long-term level of GDP by roughly 15 percent, the capital stock by 49 percent, 
which, in turn, would raise wages by 12.5 percent and create 2.7 million new jobs. We also 
found that the plan would reduce federal tax revenues by $2.4 trillion over a decade. 
Ted Cruz’s Tax Plan15 16
The plan proposed by Senator Ted Cruz takes a different approach to get to nearly the same 
place as these other tax reform plans. The plan would replace the corporate income tax and 
all payroll taxes with a 16 percent “Business Flat Tax,” or value-added tax (VAT). This allows 
for the full expensing of all capital investment, but shifts the tax burden away from capital to 
labor. Cruz compensates workers for this shift by creating a single individual tax rate of 10 
percent and expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit.

Effects of Rand Paul’s Tax Reform Plan, Tax Foundation Blog, June 18, 2015. http://taxfoundation.org/blog/

The Tax Foundation’s model estimates that the Cruz plan would boost the long-term level 
of GDP by 14 percent. This is slightly less growth than the Lee-Rubio plan because it does 
not eliminate the second layer of tax on corporate income. Still, the plan would increase the 
capital stock by 44 percent and wages by 12 percent. And because the 10 percent individual 
flax tax rate would encourage more people to enter the workforce, Cruz’s plan would create 
nearly 5 million new jobs. We also estimate the plan would reduce federal revenues by $758 
billion over a decade.
Conclusion
A few years ago, the National Taxpayer Advocate named tax complexity the number one 
issue facing American taxpayers. In addition to robbing us of 6 billion hours of our lives 
complying with its Byzantine rules, our complex tax system punishes success and hard work, 
thus, robbing the economy of its ability to create jobs and better living standards.
Using the Tax Foundation’s Taxes and Growth (TAG) Macroeconomic Tax Model, we are 
able to measure and quantify the cost of complex tax provisions on GDP, investment, and 
jobs. We find that the complexity caused by measures designed to make the tax code more 
progressive shrink the economy and kill jobs. We find that the complexity caused by tax 
policies to help the poor can discourage work and shrink wages. We find that the extremely 
complex corporate income tax—from its high rate, badly designed cost recovery systems, and 
twin layers of taxation—leads to less investment, fewer jobs, and a smaller economy. 
Finally, by scoring a wide variety of tax reform plans with our TAG model, we learned that 
there are many valid ways of ridding the tax code of its worst parts and creating a new tax 
system that boosts economic growth, creates jobs, and lifts living standards. 
I hope that the members of this committee, as well as your fellow lawmakers, take these 
lessons to heart and start us down the road to fundamental tax reform soon.  
Thank you for your time. I welcome any questions that you may have. "

Good morning Chairman Coats, Ranking Member Maloney, and members of the Joint 
Economic Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am pleased to be here on 
behalf of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) as the Committee discusses 
the issue of tax complexity and its negative impact on our nation’s economy. 
NFIB is the nation’s leading small business advocacy organization. The typical NFIB 
member employs 8 to 10 employees with annual gross receipts of about $500,000. All of NFIB’s 
members are independently owned, which is to say that none are publicly-traded corporations. 
While there is no one definition of small business, the problems NFIB members confront, 
relative to the tax code, are representative of most small businesses. A few consistent concerns 
are raised regardless of the trade or industry in which the small business is engaged.  
As part of representing small business owners, NFIB frequently conducts surveys of both 
the NFIB membership and small business population as a whole, and taxes consistently rank as 
one of their greatest concerns. In the most recent publication of the NFIB Research Foundation’s 
Small Business Problems and Priorities, 5 of the top 10 small business concerns are tax-related, 
and these tax problems fall into three categories: cost, complexity, and frequent changes.1 
Tax complexity, in particular, is a problem for small businesses because spending time 
and money on tax compliance drains financial resources. Small businesses annually spend 
between 1.7 billion and 1.8 billion hours on tax compliance and $15 billion to $16 billion on 
compliance costs.2 It is no wonder that 91 percent of NFIB members hire a professional tax

preparer to handle their taxes and the majority let their tax preparer worry about added 
complexity in the tax code.3  
I serve as President and CEO of GGNet Technologies, which is a technology company 
that provides IT and datacenter services, along with cybersecurity breach analysis and mitigation. 
We are an S-corporation that employs six full-time employees. Since our founding in 2006, our 
accounting costs have risen by 400 percent. Some of that can be attributed to company growth, 
but much of the rise in accounting costs is due to complexity of the tax code and our need to 
dedicate additional accounting time simply in order to maintain compliance.  
We are frozen during tax season. Business reports and planning between February and 
April are put on hold or delayed because we are so focused on taxes. We are unable to produce 
timely reports on cash flow, profit/loss, etc. during this time. I also feel tax complexity has a 
disproportionate impact on small businesses like mine. I do not have the same financial resources 
as larger companies. If the tax code was less burdensome, I would be able to focus more time 
and resources on my customers rather than taxes.  
It seems that the harder I work, the more complex my taxes become. When I first started 
out I was only billing out my time and taking the normal deductions for working out of my 
home. I spent 18 hours doing my taxes, but I was able to complete them myself. Now, with 
deductions, pass-throughs, and active and passive income, tax compliance is beyond my own 
ability, or even that of my bookkeeper. I am not small enough to be able to prepare taxes myself, 
but I am also not large enough to employ an entire accounting staff. As a very small business, I 
have one full-time employee devoted to addressing accounting and taxes, and approximately 40

percent of her time is spent working on tax-related functions, including classifying and filing 
federal, state and local taxes.  
Furthermore, taxes impact every aspect of my operations and decision-making. Due to 
complexity in the code, I am confronted daily with the question of how to classify an item, 
whether it be operations, capital, minor equipment, or how to differentiate between a contract 
worker and employee. Payroll complexity forces us to utilize software, but often times the 
software will not classify properly and I am forced to spend valuable time on support calls with 
my accountant. A personal example is when I teamed up with three partners to set up an LLC to 
acquire an underused fiber optic backbone in Chesterton, Indiana. This would bring gigabit 
service to homes and businesses in our community. As we developed our business plan and pro 
forma, we recognized the need for correct interpretation of the tax code in order to determine if 
this was a profitable or unprofitable venture. We contacted three different accounting firms and a 
tax attorney and experienced, first-hand, the challenges in determining what is or is not 
considered real property for tax purposes. Tax complexity also impacts my more routine 
decision-making such as those relating to inventory. For example, navigating the complexity in 
the areas of liquidity and depreciation creates significant frustration and uncertainty as I operate 
the business on a daily basis.    
In addition to spending increased time and financial resources on tax compliance, my 
company is further inhibited by last-minute changes to the code. I create our budget for the 
upcoming year in December, but it is hard to accurately project when the tax rules impacting our 
budget are not released until November or late January. Businesses, such as mine, are reluctant to 
buy equipment, make investments, and hire new employees when there is that degree of 
uncertainty regarding their tax liability.

In conclusion, small businesses truly are the engine of economic growth. This is not just a 
slogan, as small businesses created two-thirds of the net new jobs over the last decade. The 
current tax code has become a confusing and unpredictable challenge for the vast majority of 
small business owners, like myself. Our tax laws should not deter or hinder the ability of small 
business owners to create or expand their businesses. After decades of patchwork changes to the 
tax code, Congress needs to make major adjustments to our tax laws to reduce complexity and 
confusion and encourage business growth.  
As Congress takes a serious look at reforming the code, I urge you to keep in mind the 
unique challenges that face small businesses. Alleviating tax code complexity is an essential 
component in creating a strong, healthy environment for small business owners to operate and 
grow their businesses. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today and look forward to answering 
any questions you might have.

Testimony of Jared Bernstein, Senior Fellow,  
Before the Joint Economic Committee 
 
Meeting the Goals of the Federal Tax System  
Thank you very much for the invitation to testify.  Today’s hearing is nominally about the 
complexity in the tax code, but we cannot adequately address that issue without asking a broader 
question: what is the goal of the federal tax system?  To underscore this point, consider a simple, flat 
tax code wherein filing taxes took minutes instead of hours yet significantly increased the tax burden 
on the broad middle class.  I suspect such “simplicity” would be unacceptable to members of this 
committee. 
 
The goal of the system should be to raise the revenue necessary to fund the government services 
and public goods Americans want and need, and to do so in a way that’s fair, equitable, pro-growth, 
and avoids unnecessary complexity. 
 
 An equitable tax code is a progressive one with rates that rise with income so as to reduce, as 
opposed to exacerbate, market-driven inequalities. 
 A tax code that privileges some types of income over others, contains unnecessary exemptions 
and deductions, and offers numerous opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion is unfair, 
wasteful, and too complex. 
 A pro-growth tax code raises ample revenue to provide households and businesses with the 
infrastructure and security they need to prosper, and does so in ways that best promote work 
and investment.  Moreover, the relationship between taxes and growth is not simplistic: the 
empirical record shows strong growth periods amidst higher tax rates and weak growth 
periods amidst lower tax rates. 
 
In what follows, I evaluate the extent to which the current U.S. federal tax code meets these 
criteria and where it falls short.  I also offer suggestions to boost its fairness, simplicity, growth, and 
revenue-adequacy objectives. 
 
My three main findings are: 
 
  1 
 
 Fairness, simplicity, and revenue raising are often complementary: by closing regressive 
loopholes in the tax code, we reduce incentives to game the system, eliminate wasteful tax 
breaks that exacerbate inequality without promoting growth, and raise more revenues. 
 Based on demographics, inflation, debt service, and rising health costs (though measures in 
the Affordable Care Act have helped to slow that growth rate), a sustainable fiscal policy will 
likely require more, not less, revenues going forward. 
 I find no evidence to support the claim that supply-side tax cuts come anywhere close to 
paying for themselves or are even particularly pro-growth.  
 
Tax Fairness and Tax Complexity: How Can We Have More of the Former and Less of 
the Latter? 
Policymakers and taxpayers often lament the complexity of the tax code, and with good reason.  
But it’s important to remember that complexity has nothing to do with the number of tax brackets 
and rates.  If taxable income were easy to define, it wouldn’t matter how many rates existed in the 
code; all taxpayers would have to do is look up their liabilities in a table or online calculator.  Any 
computation, including one based on dozens of rates, would be easily done in the background. 
 
What makes our system so complex are the exemptions, deductions, other tax subsidies, and 
privileges for one type of income, industry, or activity over another.  On the corporate side, these 
include “transfer pricing” opportunities (the ability to book income in low-tax countries and 
deductible expenses in high-tax countries), deferral of foreign earnings, inversions, and the many 
other loopholes that explain why the effective corporate rate is at least 10 percentage points below 
the top statutory rate (about 25 percent versus 35 percent). 
 
To be clear, not all subsidies in the tax code are poorly targeted and inefficient.  Research shows 
the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, for example, encourage work and prevent 
millions of people from falling into or deeper into poverty, and children in families receiving the tax 
credits do better in school, are likelier to attend college, and can be expected to earn more as adults.  
But well-targeted, effective subsidies like the EITC and CTC are unfortunately more the exception 
than the rule. 
 
I asked one very busy and experienced tax preparer, “What makes filing taxes complicated?”  She 
responded that blaming “too many rates” was “gut-busting laughable.”  Once you determine taxable 
income, calculating liabilities takes seconds.  “But,” she went on, “how much time do I, a seasoned 
professional with great software and lots of research resources, spend dealing with the complexities 
of the tax code?  Too often, it’s hours and hours (and I can’t often bill for it).”1 
 
A flat tax (one rate), though often touted as the pinnacle of simplicity, could be immensely 
complex if taxpayers have to spend hours categorizing different types of income, taking deductions, 
and so on before applying the rate to their taxable income. 
 
When a particular income source is privileged by the tax code, people and businesses are 
incentivized to spend considerable time and money redefining their income as coming from the

privileged source. Such complexities in the tax code may thus create jobs for tax lawyers, but they 
often don’t contribute to productive activities.  They also often reduce fairness and erode the tax 
base.  
 
Consider:  
 
 Preferential rates for investment income (capital gains, dividends) mostly benefit the wealthy, 
who receive a disproportionate share of non-labor income.  As the figure below shows, lower 
rates for these income sources have virtually no impact on those in the bottom 80 percent but 
raise the post-tax income of the wealthiest families by about 5 to 8 percent, thus exacerbating 
market-driven income inequalities. 
 
 Our tax code heavily favors very high levels of inherited incomes.  Due to the high exemption 
threshold ($10.9 million for couples, $5.4 million for individuals), our current estate-tax base is 
extremely narrow, reaching only 2 of every 1,000 estates. Numerous loopholes also ensure 
that the millionaires who do pay the estate tax pay low effective rates (on average, less than 17 
percent) on their fortunes. And then there’s “step-up basis,” which wipes out the taxes on 
capital gains (already taxed at a privileged rate relative to earned income) when a wealthy 
individual passes them on to a descendant. 
 On the corporate side of the tax code, many of the loopholes cited above explain why the 
effective corporate tax rate is at least 10 percentage points below the top statutory rate (35 
percent).  As noted, a source of this difference is the ability to indefinitely defer foreign 
earnings.  The huge differential between how the code treats debt- and equity-financed 
investment is underappreciated but also important.  Because interest payments, unlike 
dividend payments, are deductible from corporate income, the effective marginal tax rate on 
debt-financed investment is minus 39 percent.  The rate on equity financing for corporations is 
27 percent (see Figure 2 here).  In other words, there is a very large subsidy for debt-financed 
investment; it’s little wonder that American businesses are prone to excessive leverage. 
  3 
 
 Business income “passed through” to the individual level (to take advantage of the lower tax 
rate on capital gains) is the single largest source of the “tax gap” (the difference between what 
people owe and what they pay).  When last measured for the year 2006, the tax gap amounted 
to some $385 billion a year, or about 10 percent of the federal budget and 2 percent of today’s 
GDP.  Sole proprietors, for example, have been found to report less than half of their income 
to the IRS. 
 In research that has become especially topical with the discovery of extensive tax evasion in 
Panama, economist Gabriel Zucman documents that, since the early 1980s, the share of 
profits that U.S.-based firms book in tax havens has grown from about 20 percent to 50 
percent.  New analysis by Kimberly Clausing “suggests that base erosion and profit shifting is 
a larger problem today than even before.”  She estimates the revenue loss from such activities 
to be between $77 billion and $111 billion by 2012, about 4 percent of federal revenues that 
year.2 
 Further evidence of increasingly aggressive profit shifting is easily gleaned from the amount of 
income that U.S.-based multinationals book in tax havens known for their extremely low-tax 
rates.  As a joint report from the White House and the U.S. Treasury recently reported, in 
2010, foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms “reported profits in the Cayman Islands that were 
more than 20 times that country’s entire economic output.”3  This simple fact alone provides 
overwhelming evidence of base-eroding profit shifting from where income is earned to where 
it will be least taxed.  
 As Austin, Burman, and Rosenthal show in a forthcoming paper, the share of corporate stock 
held in taxable household accounts has fallen from around 80 percent in the mid-1960s to 
about 25 percent now, meaning most such stock is now untaxed by U.S. authorities or held in 
tax-favored vehicles like individual retirement accounts or by nonprofits or foreigners. 
 
All told, the extensive set of legal subsidies to individuals or businesses through exemptions, 
deductions, and other tax subsidies, generally referred to as tax expenditures, cut federal income tax 
revenue by over $1.2 trillion last year — more than the cost of Social Security or the combined cost 
of Medicare and Medicaid.  Moreover, as shown in the figure below, these tax breaks 
disproportionately benefit higher-income households, often wastefully subsidizing behavior that 
would occur anyway.  The top 1 percent of households get almost 17 percent of the benefit of the 
ten largest tax expenditures, almost as much as the bottom 40 percent of households.

Why do all of these loopholes, deductions, and favorable rates exist?  One explanation, often 
proffered with no supporting evidence, is that these complexities create incentives for growth.  In 
some cases, such claims are prima facie indefensible.  Step-up basis, for instance, encourages wealthy 
individuals to hold assets until death even if the gains from selling the assets might be more 
productively deployed elsewhere in the economy.  As another example, the huge discrepancy in the 
tax cost of debt financing versus equity financing has no obvious growth justification.  And the fact 
that it’s cheaper, from an effective-tax-rate perspective, for multinational American companies to 
create real economic activity abroad rather than here disincentivizes job creation in the United 
States. 
 
There’s also no defense at all for exacerbating the problem of illegal tax evasion, as congressional 
conservatives have been doing by cutting the budget of the IRS.  As the figure below from CBPP 
Tax Policy Director Chuck Marr reveals, compared to 2010, the IRS budget is down 17 percent in 
real dollars and enforcement staffing is down by 23 percent, while individual filings are up 7 percent.  
Treasury estimates that each additional $1 spent on IRS enforcement yields $6 of additional revenue. 
  5 
 
 
 
It is therefore essential, in the name of fairness, simplicity, and revenue collection, to curb tax 
avoidance and evasion.  The next section focuses on the revenue issue and the final section 
examines the fundamental claim of “supply-side” tax cuts: that rate cuts reliably generate significant 
economic growth.  Both theory and evidence find little support for this claim. 
 
Meeting Our Revenue Needs 
Even with no policy changes in major government programs, our revenues must increase for 
“mechanical” reasons.  Simply holding real spending per capita constant, population growth and 
inflation together will require a 40 percent increase in revenues over the next decade.  As the share 
of Americans who are 65 and older will increase from the current 15 percent to 20 percent by 
around 2040, Medicare and Social Security will cost more.  CBO estimates that, by 2026, spending 
on these two programs will need to go up by just under 2 percent of GDP (over $500 billion of 
projected 2026 GDP). 
 
Along with demographics, another source of pressure on future revenues is health-care cost 
growth, which has historically outpaced overall growth, thus absorbing an increasing share of GDP.  
Clearly, attacking the inefficiencies behind this excess growth rate was a goal of the Affordable Care 
6 
 
Act (ACA), and it has been a notable success thus far.  Today’s budget projections of health care 
costs are down 30 percent from those made prior to the ACA, and that improvement includes the 
costs of the health care reform itself. 
 
Finally, CBO expects interest payments on government debt to rise from 1.4 to 3 percent of 
GDP over the next decade.  Like other forecasters, CBO has overestimated the path of interest rates 
in recent years, so perhaps, if rates remain as low as forward market indicators expect them to, there 
will be some debt relief.  But the path of future interest rates is unknowable, so fiscal rectitude 
should lead us to plan for the possibility of rising interest payments. 
 
To meet these needs and leave ourselves room for necessary additional investments in 
infrastructure and human capital while sticking to the principles outlined above, we should adopt 
revenue raisers that increase fairness and simplicity (or, at least, that avoid new complexities). 
 
The price of admission to any discussion of tax reform should thus be a willingness to close the 
so-called “carried interest loophole,” which allows hedge fund managers to face favorable asset-
based rates on their earnings at a cost of $19 billion in lost revenue over ten years.  Those who claim 
to want to do major tax reform yet are unwilling to simplify the code by first closing this loophole 
— one with virtually no defenders — should be considered akin to those who say they’re ready to 
run a marathon but get winded walking up the stairs. 
 
The preferential treatment of wealthy inheritances would be another great place to start.  The 
President’s recent budget would lower the estate-tax exemption threshold from $10.9 million to $7 
million for couples (and from $5.4 million to $3.5 million for individuals) and increase the top 
marginal estate-tax rate from 40 percent to 45 percent.  It would also close a few estate and gift-tax 
loopholes, one of which (the Grantor Retained Annuity Trust loophole) allows an estate to put an 
investment in a trust to avoid paying capital gains. Under these changes, which would raise $226 
billion over 10 years, the estate tax would still affect only about 0.3 percent of decedents.4 
 
In a similar vein, the President’s budget proposes to close the “step-up” loophole discussed 
above, while leaving in significant exemptions so that the change only affects wealthy heirs. 
Combined with his proposal to raise the capital gains rate from its current 23.8 percent to 28 
percent, ending step-up basis raises $235 billion over ten years.  Note that reducing the tax 
differential between capital gains and income helps to simplify the system as well, by reducing a 
distortionary incentive to redefine earnings and income (one exploited, for example, by those who 
tap the carried interest loophole). 
 
When it comes to some of the other wasteful subsidies in the tax code, it’s hard politically to 
target one over another — behind every loophole is a lobbyist whose salary depends on defending 
that tax break as a treasured “job creation” program.  Rather than go after these loopholes one at a 
time, it would thus be both easier and fairer to limit all deductions to 28 percent instead of the top 
income tax rate of almost 40 percent.  
 
                                                 
4 I discuss these and some of the other suggested revenue raisers in this section in a recent American Prospect article: 
“We’re going to need more revenue,” Vol 27, #2, Spring 2016. 
  7 
 
This approach avoids picking winners and losers and boosts economic efficiency by reducing the 
extent to which we subsidize behaviors that would occur anyway among the wealthy, like saving for 
retirement or buying a home.  Applied to incomes of $250,000 or more, this cap would generate 
savings of more than $640 billion over ten years.  
 
Turning to the corporate side of the tax code, the simplest way to shut down companies’ deferral 
of foreign earnings is a minimum tax that multinationals must pay on those earnings when they earn 
them, after which they could repatriate their earnings without further taxation.  The Obama 
administration plugs in 19 percent for this tax, which would raise $350 billion over ten years.5 
 
Finally, it is time to raise the federal gas tax.  This tax is how we fund both highway infrastructure 
and the federal contribution to public transit, and it has been stuck at 18.4 cents a gallon in nominal 
terms since 1993.  Meanwhile, the costs of maintenance have gone up, as has vehicle mileage, 
leading to perennial shortfalls in the Highway Trust Fund.  A tax on fossil fuels is also smart 
environmental policy, and there’s even been some bipartisan support for the idea.  One plan would 
raise the gas tax by 12 cents a gallon over two years (6 cents per year) and then index it to inflation.  
That would raise $180 billion over ten years.  With gas prices still very low, the sooner such an 
increase goes into effect, the better. 
 
The Non-Relationship Between Supply-Side Tax Cuts and Growth 
For decades, some policymakers and economists have maintained that cuts in tax rates will lead 
to faster growth by raising “supply-side” inputs including labor, capital, and other forms of 
investment.  The argument is that lowering the after-tax cost of investment and raising the after-tax 
wage will cause the economy’s labor supply and capital investment to go up, boosting productivity 
and growth.  The gains will then trickle down to the jobs and incomes of low- and middle-income 
people.  
 
There’s a degree of logic to the first part of this claim, but it is woefully incomplete, even in a 
theoretical sense.  Tax economists Bill Gale and Andrew Samwick recently noted three ways in 
which this simple supply-side theory must be amended.6 
 
First, Gale and Samwick point out that, “while there is no doubt that tax policy can influence 
economic choices, it is by no means obvious … that tax rate cuts will ultimately lead to a larger 
economy in the long run.”  They note the predicted impacts on wages and investing, but go on to 
                                                 
5 Don’t conflate this minimum tax on foreign earnings with a repatriation tax holiday.  That’s a big money loser, as it 
allows multinationals to bring foreign earnings home from abroad at a much reduced rate, only to start storing them 
overseas again once the “holiday” has expired (note also that some foreign earnings are merely “booked” abroad to tap 
the benefits of deferral, but are already accessed by the US parent company).  JCT scores tax repatriation as costing about 
$100 billion over 10 years.  A tax holiday cannot constitute a “pay-for” for infrastructure investment (or anything else), 
as is often suggested, because it is a revenue loser in the long run. 
Instead, “deemed” or compulsory repatriation as part of a transition to a more efficient international tax regime would 
be a very sensible source of income for a sizable, one-time infrastructure investment.  Under any transition, there needs 
to be a process for dealing with the large stock on deferred earnings that is currently booked abroad, which is thought to 
be in the neighborhood of $2 trillion.  The common approach is a one-time transition tax.  President Obama’s proposal 
calls for a 14 percent transition tax, yielding over $200 billion that could be applied to infrastructure investment.  
6 “Effects of Income Tax Changes on Economic Growth,” by William Gale and Andrew Samwick, February 2016.  
8 
 
stress that tax cuts “would also raise the after-tax income people receive from their current level of 
activities, which lessens their need to work, save, and invest.  The first effect normally raises 
economic activity (through so-called substitution effects), while the second effect normally reduces it 
(through so-called income effects).”  On net, some empirical research finds substitution effects to 
dominate income effects, but Gale and Samwick point out that this outcome is often conditional on 
the design of the tax cut. 
 
Second, they point out that the growth effects of tax cuts also depend on how they are financed: 
“Tax cuts financed by immediate cuts in unproductive government spending could raise output, but 
tax cuts financed by reductions in government investment [e.g., in productive infrastructure or 
human capital] could reduce output.”  They add that deficit-financed tax cuts that increase federal 
borrowing can reduce long-term growth: “The historical evidence and simulation analyses suggest 
that tax cuts that are financed by debt for an extended period of time will have little positive impact 
on long-term growth and could reduce growth.” 
 
Finally, Gale and Samwick argue that rate cuts matched with base-broadeners — the central 
mantra of tax reform — will raise the effective tax rates faced by some households and firms (due, 
for example, to the elimination of various tax expenditures).  Such increases, they argue, will operate 
“…in a direction opposite to rate cuts and mitigate their effects on economic growth.”  Conversely, 
they entertain the possibility that base-broadening could reallocate “resources from sectors that are 
currently tax-preferred to sectors that have the highest economic (pre-tax) return, which should 
increase the overall size of the economy.” 
 
Given these considerations, the claim that supply-side tax cuts boost investment, jobs, and GDP 
growth, like any economic theory, must be empirically scrutinized. One simple way to do so is to 
make scatterplots of the top tax rate in a given year against the growth in the economic variables that 
those rates are supposed to push up.  If the theory is correct, high top marginal rates should be 
associated with weaker growth and low top marginal rates with stronger growth — that is, we’d 
expect the dots on the scatterplot to line up as they do in the next figure, showing a made-up inverse 
relationship between rates and growth, just to give a reference point by which to judge the following 
plots. 
 
  9 
 
 
 
Unfortunately for supply-side theory, the actual graphs, as opposed to the above imaginary one, 
do not reveal this pattern at all.  The five scatterplots below plot the annual percentage change in 
real per capita GDP, employment, capital investment, productivity, and pretax median family 
income (respectively) relative to top marginal rates, with annual data running from 1947 to the most 
recent observation (2014 or 2015).  In each case, the top marginal rate is plotted on the X-axis 
against the percent change in the variable in question on the Y-axis.  A “best-fit” line is plotted 
through the dots.

In no case is the relationship negative, as predicted by supply-side theory.  To the contrary, the 
slope of the regression line tends to be positive, though its rise is too mild to be statistically 
significant (with the exception of pretax median family income).  
 
To be clear, these graphs do not show that higher tax rates promote investment, growth, and jobs.  
First, as noted above, the impact of tax cuts on growth is conditional on numerous factors, including 
the tradeoff between income and substitution effects, how the cuts are financed, changes in effective 
rates, and, I’d add, broader economic conditions (for example, temporary tax cuts for low- and 
middle-income people are likely to be growth-inducing during recessions through demand-side 
impacts). 
Second, the factors that determine growth and its supply-side inputs are many and varied, 
including demographics, “innovation” (total factor productivity, or output growth net of all relevant 
inputs), monetary policy, other fiscal policies, and much more, including intangibles such as “animal 
spirits” and consumer confidence. 
 
  15 
 
But the fact that the simple empirical record is uniformly hostile to the supply-side story, coupled 
with that story’s theoretical shortcomings, should put the burden of proof squarely on those arguing 
that supply-side tax cuts will be pro-growth. 
 
Piketty, Saez, and Stantcheva have developed evidence similar to that above using cross-country 
variation.  Looking at numerous economies between 1960 and 2010, they show that cuts in top 
marginal rates were not associated with faster per capita income growth.  Instead, they were 
negatively and significantly correlated with a greater share of national income accruing to the top 1 
percent.  That is, supply-side tax cuts didn’t raise growth; they raised inequality.7 
 
Evidence at the sub-national level — where various states, led by Kansas, have been aggressively 
cutting taxes while policy officials tout the benefits of supply-side tax cuts — also tilts strongly 
against tax cuts as a growth strategy.  The cuts in Kansas that took effect in 2013, for example, have 
now blown a $400 million hole in the state’s budget.  When one of my fellow witnesses, Art Laffer, 
helped design these cuts, he predicted (along with Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation) that 
they would provide an “immediate and lasting boost” to the Kansas economy.  Yet not only have 
the cuts caused serious underfunding of the state’s education system, they’ve also coincided with 
weak job and GDP growth.  The Kansas Legislative Research Department’s projections suggest that 
the economy will remain weaker than the overall US economy for the foreseeable future. 
  
Advocates of supply-side theory may argue that the benefits of the cuts are just taking longer to 
appear than they originally predicted, but based on the wealth of empirical evidence shown here and 
in other analyses I’ve cited, policymakers would be wise to reject such arguments. 
 
Conclusion 
The goal of a tax code in an advanced economy must to be raise ample revenues in ways that are 
efficient, pro-growth, and, perhaps most importantly, widely perceived as fair.  Complexity is not a 
function of the number of rates; it is driven by the spate of deductions, credits, exemptions, and 
myriad other opportunities to avoid taxes through complicated redefinitions of income into forms 
given preferential treatment by the code. 
 
Of course, our economic lives can themselves be complex, and the tax code will inevitably reflect 
them to some degree.  We very much want, for example, to both prevent poverty and incentivize 
work among the least well off, and the work-based refundable credits mentioned above have a been 
a highly successful tax expenditure.  In fact, there is bipartisan support to increase the EITC for 
childless adults, who current receive only a very small amount from that worthy program. 
 
We should, however, pursue changes that constitute a “three-fer” by simultaneously boosting 
revenues, fairness, and simplicity.  That means adequately funding the IRS, closing the many 
loopholes identified in this testimony, and avoiding the supply-side tax cuts that cut strongly against 
fairness and progressivity with little to nothing to show for them in the way of economic growth.  If 
we do that, we’ll have a much-improved tax code. 
   
                                                 
7 One possible explanation is that at higher tax rates, the wealthiest individuals bargain less aggressively for higher pretax 
compensation (since they’ll be able to keep less of each marginal dollar they earn).  See Bivens and Mishel (2013): 
https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.27.3.57.

Data Note 
 
Each data point in each chart represents a calendar year.  The top federal marginal income tax 
rate (from the Tax Policy Center) is on the X-axis of each chart; the Y-axes represent the growth, 
from one year prior, of the variables in question.  Productivity is for the nonfarm business sector; 
real capital services come from economist John Fernald’s growth accounting dataset; GDP has been 
adjusted for both inflation and population size; and the 2013 value for real median family income 
(Census Bureau) has been imputed because of changing survey methods.  
 
While these charts only show the non-relationship between top marginal tax rates and 
contemporaneous economic activity, looking two, three, or four years out does not change the 
findings.  In fact, longer lags often lead to an increased positive correlation with higher top marginal 
tax rates, a result that stands in direct contrast to what tax cut proponents typically predict.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE LEE, CHAIR, A U.S. 
SENATOR FROM UTAH 
Chairman Lee. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for 
this hearing of the Joint Economic Committee. 
The American labor market, which we will be discussing today, 
is strong. The current economic expansion is the longest that we 
have encountered in all of U.S. history. Our unemployment rate 
has remained low, at or below 4 percent, for the last 20 months 
and, staggeringly, encouragingly, it continues to fall. 
Average wage growth has of course slowed down a bit, but it re-
mains strongest for many workers who in the past have been paid 
less well than others. The gains have been broadly shared. African- 
American and Hispanic unemployment rates are today at all-time 
historic lows. Female labor force participation is approaching an 
all-time high, and analysts speculate that we still at this moment 
have yet to reach full employment. 
Yet, behind these indicators of very significant, robust economic 
strength, there lies a worrisome long-term trend—what Nicholas 
Eberstadt at the American Enterprise Institute has called ‘‘an in-
visible crisis.’’ Many American men are leaving the workforce alto-
gether. Though on the rise, the employment-to-population ratio for 
prime age men, those between the ages of 25 and 54, is near levels 
that we have not seen in this country for decades, since the Great 
Depression in fact. 
Even in today’s really strong, unusually good labor market, we 
see that once top connections to the workplace have not only start-
ed to slacken, but they have also started to fray. The economic im-
plications  of  such  disconnection  should  be  clear  to  all,  and 
anecdotally many of us have observed this in one fashion or an-
other. But the Joint Economic Committee’s Social Capital Project,

as part of its mission to understand and explain what we refer to 
as ‘‘associational life in America,’’ has studied the plight of these 
disconnected men and identified potentially greater, more severe 
consequences for the health of our families and our communities. 
In its report, which bears the title ‘‘Inactive, Disconnected, and 
Ailing: A Portrait of Prime Age Men Out of The Labor Force,’’ the 
Joint Economic Committee’s Social Capital Project found that dis-
connected men are more socially isolated, and they are less happy. 
And, that this is a problem. They are more isolated and more dis-
connected than their employed peers. 
At the community level, the disappearance of work can lead to 
the population brain drain and the decline of institutions of civil 
society. 
If we are to expand opportunity by strengthening families, by 
strengthening communities and other institutions of civil society, 
then we have to devote our attention to work, a means of sup-
porting ourselves and our families, a source of meaning and of pur-
pose, and a site for affirming and satisfying and connecting rela-
tionships. 
I hope our discussions this afternoon will give us something of 
a  clearer  sense  of  how  to  connect  more  Americans  to  this 
wellspring of opportunity and connectedness that we need so much 
in our society for it to thrive. 
At this afternoon’s hearing, we will seek to better understand the 
forces shaping the labor market and Americans’ connections to that 
labor market. 
A  variety  of  reasons  have  been  offered  to  explain  why  fewer 
Americans in their prime years are entering the workforce. Several 
interdependent themes emerge from most analyses. We have got 
declining economic dynamism, falling worker mobility, stagnating 
wages, trade exposure, employment polarization, skill-biased tech-
nological change, and an expanding safety net that sometimes has 
implications beyond those that were intended at the time of the 
creation of the program at issue. 
Our next step will be to consider policy reforms consonant with 
the most plausible explanations for declining prime age labor force 
participation. 
What barriers to opportunity can we identify first and then try 
to remove? How might incentives to join the workforce be strength-
ened? What might the government be doing to impair the removal 
of those barriers? How might we more smartly invest human and 
social capital to create new opportunities? 
Possible solutions may involve reforming the safety net, modern-
izing  labor  regulations,  and  increasing  wage  growth.  The  Social 
Capital Project will cover a number of these topics in a forthcoming 
report, all of them in fact. And that report will in turn be informed 
by the insights of today’s panelists. 
I look forward to their testimonies, and am grateful to each of 
our panelists for joining us today for this productive conversation 
aimed at drawing disconnected Americans off the sidelines and into 
the workplace. 
I now recognize Senator Hassan for her opening remarks.

OPENING STATEMENT OF MARGARET WOOD HASSAN, A U.S. 
SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE 
Senator Hassan. Well thank you, Chairman Lee. Thank you to 
our panelists for being here today. 
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate today’s focus, getting this Committee 
to focus on the important issue of getting more Americans to par-
ticipate in our workforce. Members of both parties agree that we 
must increase labor force participation. While low unemployment 
rates in my home State of New Hampshire and across the country 
are welcome news, we know that a low unemployment rate can also 
present  real  challenges,  from  businesses  not  being  able  to  find 
workers, to additional pressure being put on the productivity of our 
current workforce. 
For a variety of reasons, too many Americans are falling out of 
the workforce, and a smaller percentage of Americans participating 
in the workforce can drag on economic growth. 
It is critical that we address the root cause that results in people 
not seeking employment. And today’s hearing presents an oppor-
tunity to address those factors and look toward bipartisan solu-
tions. 
To start, as our economy changes rapidly individuals may not 
have the skills and supports that they need to enter and remain 
in the workforce. And I have heard from businesses throughout 
New Hampshire that one of their top challenges is finding more 
qualified workers, even at entry level jobs. Addressing this chal-
lenge requires us to both strengthen job training efforts and re-
move the barriers that prevent too many people from participating 
or remaining in the workforce. 
I have introduced bipartisan legislation, The Gateway To Careers 
Act, that would do just that. This bill would provide grants to sup-
port  partnerships  between  community  or  technical  colleges  and 
workforce development partners such as State workforce develop-
ment boards, industry associations, and community-based organiza-
tions. 
These partnerships would help remove many of the barriers that 
prevent too many people from completing a two-year degree or cre-
dential by connecting them to support services, including housing, 
mental health, and substance use disorder treatment, assistance in 
obtaining  health  insurance  coverage,  offering  career  counseling, 
transportation, and other services. 
By strengthening job training and support services, we can con-
nect more people with the tools that they need to enter and succeed 
in our changing economy. 
Another systemic barrier that many Americans face is a lack of 
access to paid leave and to child care. Frequently those who want 
to work are held back by pressing family responsibilities that make 
it impossible. 
A recent report by the Hamilton Project showed that 9.6 million 
women who are not participating in our workforce list family and 
home responsibilities as their primary reason. 
And,  Mr.  Chair,  I  request  that  the  Hamilton  Project  report, 
which is called ‘‘Labor Force Nonparticipation: Trends, Causes, and 
Policy Solutions,’’ be entered into the record. 
Chairman Lee. Without objection.

Senator Hassan. Thank you. By enacting more family friendly 
policies that enable people to balance their work and family respon-
sibilities, we can help more people join or rejoin the labor market. 
We also must break down employment barriers facing tradition-
ally  disadvantaged  communities.  In  2018,  Brookings  found  that 
only 4 out of 10 working-age adults who experienced disabilities 
are employed. So we also need to address the challenges that those 
who experience disabilities encounter entering the workforce. 
As governor, I signed legislation banning employers from paying 
workers with disabilities at a lower rate than the minimum wage, 
making New Hampshire the first State in the Nation to ban sub- 
minimum wages for people who experience disabilities. 
We must make this a Federal priority, which is why I have co- 
sponsored  the  Transformation  To  Competitive  Employment  Act, 
which would phase out the practice of paying a sub-minimum wage 
to workers who experience disabilities nationwide. 
We should also make sure that workers who experience disabil-
ities receive the support they need to succeed in the workplace and 
are less likely to fall out of the labor market. 
Finally,  no  conversation  about  increasing  participation  in  our 
workforce  can  exclude  addressing  the  cost  of  higher  education. 
Right now, students face far too many obstacles in getting the edu-
cation that they need, particularly when it comes to affordability. 
No one who is pursuing higher education so that they can build 
a better future for themselves and in turn for our economy should 
have to put that goal on hold because they cannot afford it. And 
they should not have to take out substantial debt to do so, either. 
I will continue working on strategies to increase college afford-
ability and to lower the burden of student debt so that more work-
ers can get the education that they need to thrive. We can all agree 
that tackling our workforce challenges requires a multifaceted and 
comprehensive approach. There is not a single solution, and we 
have multiple opportunities to connect more people to work. 
I look forward to hearing more from our witnesses today, and 
now I will turn it back to you, Chairman Lee.

missions for the Record on page 32.] 
Chairman Lee. Thank you, Senator Hassan. 
I would now like to introduce our panel of distinguished wit-
nesses. First we have Dr. Veronique De Rugy who is a Senior Re-
search Fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. 
Her primary research interests include the U.S. economy, the Fed-
eral budget, homeland security, taxation, tax competition, elimi-
nation of the Export-Import Bank, and financial privacy. Just a few 
small issues that do not affect anything else [laughing]. 
Every one of them are issues of great importance. Previously Dr. 
De Rugy had been a Resident Fellow at the American Enterprise 
Institute. Also, a Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute. And a Re-
search Fellow at the Atlas Economic Research Foundation. 
So, Dr. De Rugy, welcome.

STATEMENT OF DR. VERONIQUE DE RUGY, SENIOR RESEARCH 
FELLOW, MERCATUS CENTER, ARLINGTON, VA 
Dr. De Rugy. Mr. Chairman, members of this Committee, thank 
you for having me today. I am a Senior Research Fellow at the 
Mercatus Center  at  George Mason University. So  ensuring  that 
American workers can stay attached to the workforce is a worthy 
goal, and in pursuit of this goal understanding what the problems 
with the labor markets are or are not, and understanding the rea-
sons for the lack of attachment to the labor force by some workers 
is key to designing the right policy. And for that, to that effect, I 
will be making three points. 
So first, the labor market and the state of the American workers 
are better than commonly suggested. 
However, a small but sizeable segment of working-age Americans 
have not shared in that progress. 
Third, some government policies at the Federal, State, and local 
levels today make it harder for some workers to tap into a par-
ticular market in which workers are paid higher wages. 
So first, as, Mr. Chairman, you have said, the unemployment is 
at its lowest in 50 years, no matter how you measure it. So is pov-
erty. And while some argue that the real wages have been stagnant 
over the past several decades, measured with the right deflator and 
after adjusting for taxes and transfer, real wages have unquestion-
ably increased. The same is true of real median household income, 
especially after adjusting for household sizes.

Also, while millions of manufacturing and other middle-skill jobs 
have disappeared, that decline has been more than offset by the in-
crease in high-skill jobs. 
Second, despite this healthy employment number, some Ameri-
cans, disproportionately working age men, have dropped out of the 
labor force entirely. This phenomenon has rightly received serious 
attention from scholars and policymakers. 
One conclusion of this research is that American workers con-
fronted with economic disruptions today face relatively new and 
more serious problems than they were facing before. In the past, 
economic shocks were followed by an increase in the unemployment 
rate. But as people moved away to find jobs, or change jobs in in-
dustry altogether, the unemployment rate would go down. Well, not 
in this case. 
Instead, Americans, especially those who were not college edu-
cated, do not necessarily move away and remain in hard-hit areas 
even if it means staying unemployed. 
So my third point is that some policies reduce interstate mobility, 
or they change incentives for workers on the margins who work 
less or not at all. And they are in desperate need of reform. So I 
will only cite three type of programs. 
So the first one, which will not be a surprise to this Committee, 
is land and zoning regulations. They have played an oversized role 
in exacerbating work adjustment issues. These regulations increase 
the cost of housing in higher-wage areas and make it harder to 
move there. 
Standard estimates are that even modest housing deregulation 
would lead to a large increase in the supply of housing in the most 
prosperous areas in the country, which would give lower income 
workers greater access to higher-wage labor markets. 
Land and zoning regulations also create an incentive for a low- 
skilled worker to stay where housing is cheap, even though the job 
opportunities there are more limited. 
Second, occupational licensing laws raise barriers between work-
ers and better job markets. These requirements operate as barriers 
to interstate mobility as they vary between states and cannot be 
transferred. 
Occupational licensing also increases the price of goods and serv-
ices for consumers. In the case of services such as child care, this 
effect  is  an  impediment  to  working  parents  wishing  to  stay  at-
tached to the workforce. 
Third, in addition to the limits on access to better job markets, 
some government policies may reduce a worker’s incentive to seek 
employment. Unfortunately, Social Security disability incentive is 
one of these programs. The program was created to support those 
struck with health conditions or injuries that make it difficult or 
impossible to work, and it continues, thankfully, to play that role. 
But scholars have found that the program has also created an in-
centive not to work for a rising number of adults with limited earn-
ing potential who are physically able to work. 
In conclusion, before policymakers rush to implement new Fed-
eral Government programs to address worker adjustment issues, 
we should acknowledge that some of the challenge in connecting 
workers to the workforce can be created by existing programs.

Removing these barriers would lead to more opportunities and 
better lives for those who have been frozen out of the gains enjoyed 
by most workers. 
Finally, and I think this is important, while these reforms may 
not be the whole answer at all to this challenge, a failure to make 
these changes will make other reform efforts by the Federal Gov-
ernment ineffective. 
Thank you, and I am looking forward to your questions.

the Submissions for the Record on page 34.] 
Chairman Lee. Thank you, Dr. De Rugy. We will turn next to 
Mr. Cass. I may have to go vote in a moment, but I will be right 
back if I do. Thank you. 
STATEMENT OF MR. OREN CASS, SENIOR FELLOW, 
MANHATTAN INSTITUTE, NEW YORK, NY 
Mr. Cass. Thank you, Chairman, Madam Vice Chair, and mem-
bers of the Committee. My written testimony focuses on three top-
ics. 
First, explaining why in my view connecting people to work is so 
important and not something the government benefits and trans-
fers can replace. 
Second, reviewing the data on the declining health of the labor 
market  for  men  in  particular,  and  the  accompanying  decline  in 
labor force participation. 
And third, outlining the kinds of policies we might pursue in re-
sponse in areas ranging from regulatory reform, education reform, 
trade and immigration policy, organized labor, a safety net, and our 
programs of taxes and subsidies. 
Here I would like to focus on two points in particular, because 
certainly a wide variety of factors influence the long-term slide in 
labor force participation for American men. 
For instance, changes in cultural norms and home environments 
may both be discouraging men from working and reducing their ca-
pacity. The labor market, meanwhile, has failed to generate attrac-
tive opportunities that prospective workers are capable of seizing. 
Attempts to allocate responsibility among these factors have set 
off two robust, but in my view ultimately irrelevant, debates. The 
first of these is, have wages technically risen or fallen? 
Men’s median weekly earnings have fallen by seven percent since 
1979, if adjusted for inflation using the standard CPI from the Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics; but an alternative measure from the Bu-
reau of Economic Analysis suggests that earnings have increased 
over the period by 12 percent. 
Even using the more optimistic estimate, it is important to recog-
nize the gains hold only for men with college degrees—excuse me, 
only for women with college degrees. All other groups saw declines. 
It  is  also  worth  noting  that  the  problem  is  particularly  pro-
nounced with younger men, exactly those who in many cases we 
are most concerned with connecting to the workforce in the first 
place. 
The U.S. Census Bureau reports that between 1975 and 2016 the 
share of men aged 25 to 34 earning less than $30,000 per year in-
creased from 25 percent to 41 percent. And that of course is among

those who are working, ignoring the higher share that are earning 
nothing. 
I think it is also important to recognize when we discuss these 
data that, while my colleague, Dr. De Rugy, is correct that these 
data look different with respect to taxes and transfers and house-
hold income, neither of those metrics is relevant to how an indi-
vidual worker would perceive the decision to enter the labor mar-
ket. If anything, at the margin but increases in taxes and transfers 
are likely to have made entering the workforce less attractive. 
But ultimately, whether wages are slightly lower or higher in 
real terms is beside the point. No one believes that a 5 percent 
wage decline over 40 years would produce a labor market exodus 
while a 5 percent wage increase would flood the market with new 
workers. The important fact, regardless, would be that men’s me-
dian earnings have fallen woefully behind the trajectory of growth 
in the wider economy, and the rising costs associated with achiev-
ing a middle class lifestyle. 
Our concern ultimately is not only about the absolute value of 
the wage, but also its relative value. The easiest way to see this 
is to recognize that the fact that men may have treaded water since 
1970 is an arbitrary point of comparison. We might just as well ask 
whether or not men are doing better than they were in 1910. And 
if we truly believed in absolutely that wage was all that mattered, 
we might posit that as long as men were earning as much as they 
had been in 1910 there would be no problem. 
Obviously I do not think anyone believes that, and so we should 
not necessarily believe that stagnation since 1970 is any more ac-
ceptable. 
The second robust but relevant debate centers on attempts to al-
locate responsibility across the myriad factors that may be influ-
encing men’s behavior. 
Stagnated wages may be one problem, but many people view the 
cultural problem to be even larger. And some worry that, if it is 
truly a cultural problem, then policymakers would be helpless. 
In my view, that is not the right way of looking at it. Regardless 
of how wage is assigned the various factors, the question for policy-
makers today is not how we got into the situation but how to get 
out  of  it.  Huge,  immovable  cultural  and  economic  burdens  may 
push toward harmful decisions, but so too a number of factors push 
more constructively: behaving responsibly, planning for the future, 
holding a job, sacrificing for a family. 
People are aware that these things really do have benefits. And 
in  the  past  in  a  world  not  unrecognizably  different  from  the 
present,  with  many  critical  conditions  resting  in  similar  repose, 
men were more likely to work. 
Whatever marginal shift changed outcomes for the worse, other 
marginal shifts, even different ones, can cause just as much change 
for the better. So whether major factors are cultural, or whether 
major factors are ones that policymakers cannot affect, the ques-
tion for us for today is what factors, economic or cultural, can pol-
icymakers affect? 
This is obviously most strongly the case when it comes to the 
labor market, the health of the economy, and the kinds of jobs that 
are created. If more and better jobs are more accessible to more

people, I think most of us would agree, more people would be more

policy can help.

STATEMENT OF DR. JAY SHAMBAUGH, DIRECTOR, THE HAM-
ILTON PROJECT, SENIOR FELLOW IN ECONOMIC STUDIES, 
THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION, WASHINGTON, DC 
Dr.  Shambaugh.  Thanks  very  much.  Mr.  Chairman,  Madam 
Vice Chair, members of the Joint Economic Committee, thank you 
for inviting me to discuss this important topic. Getting more people 
into the labor market and into jobs is a central part of raising liv-
ing standards. 
The United States used to be a leader in labor force participation 
rates, or LFPR, for both men and women, but now substantially 
lags behind many other advanced economies. 
Although overall U.S. LFPR has been stable since about 2015, it 
had been on a downward trend beginning around the year 2000. 
Much, but not all, of that decline is attributable to the aging of the 
population as more adults are retirement age. If we look across age 
groups, younger adults are participating less than they used to, 
largely because more of them are in school. 
Adults over 55 are participating at higher rates than they used 
to. And for those aged 25 to 54, what economists often call prime- 
age workers, LFPR has been rebounding since about 2015 but is 
still below its 1999 peak. There is room in the labor market for 
participation to rise. 
Prime-age men have seen a persistent downward trend in LFPR 
over the last half century, largely due to declining rates among 
men with less education. And research has shown that this group 
has seen a decline in demand for their labor. And prime-age men 
with less than a high school education make about three dollars 
less an hour than they did in 1980, adjusted for inflation. 
In my work with the Hamilton Project, we have argued that a 
great deal can be learned about how to lift participation by looking 
at the gaps across groups and the specific barriers they face, and 
that is what I would like to focus on today. 
For example, LFPR is 94 percent for prime-age men with a col-
lege degree or more, but 86 percent for those with a high school 
degree, and just 80 percent for those with less than a high school 
degree. Taking steps to increase training and education, along with 
steps to lift wages, could improve labor market outcomes and di-
rectly lift participation for that group.

Low-wage U.S. markets are very unstable. And we can over-esti-
mate how many people are truly out of the labor force as opposed 
to struggling to stay in it. Of those out of the labor force in a given 
month who are not disabled, students, retired, or care givers, at 
least three-quarters are actually back in the labor force at some 
point in the next 16 months. 
If  we  improve  pay,  schedules,  bargaining  power,  and  worker 
rights in these jobs, we can make them more stable and that could 
help  participation.  It  is  important  to  remember,  though,  that 
women represent the largest pool of untapped labor in today’s labor 
market. Of the 22 million prime-age individuals out of the labor 
force, almost 11 million list, quote, ‘‘taking care of family member’’ 
as the reason. And 90 percent of those individuals are women. 
While some are home by choice, 35 percent of women who say 
they want a job but are not working list family responsibilities as 
the barrier. And evidence shows that better availability of child 
care in particular for lower income households would allow more 
who want to work to be in the labor force, and that well-designed 
parental  leave  policies  could  keep  more  women  attached  to  the 
labor force after having children. 
There  are  also  massive  gaps  in  LFPR  across  places.  In  top- 
ranked counties, prime-age LFPR is 88 percent, compared to 70 
percent in bottom-ranked counties. And this gap dwarfs the recent 
drop  in  nationwide  LFPR.  Place-based  policies  that  try  to  spur 
labor demand in struggling regions could lift national participation. 
There are also huge barriers to working for the formerly incar-
cerated. African-American men have lower rates of participation, 
likely due in part to disproportionate incarceration rates, as well 
as what studies show to be considerable discrimination in labor 
markets. Reducing the punitiveness of the criminal justice system 
in combating these barriers is important. 
Finally, the second largest group out of the labor force after care 
givers are those listing health or disability as a barrier. We need 
better health care and treatment to keep people in the labor mar-
ket. It is important to note that it is poor health, not the safety net, 
that is a major barrier to work. Not all of those listing health as 
a  reason  for  being  out  of  the  labor  force  receive  disability  pay-
ments, and reported health measures for this group show sharply 
worse health relative to the overall population. Furthermore, there 
is no evidence that increasing work requirements in SNAP or intro-
ducing them into Medicaid lifts LFPR meaningfully. 
Beyond removing barriers, creating jobs is also crucial. A strong 
economy can raise wages, force employers to cast a wider net to 
find workers, and draw people into the labor market. 
Conversely,  economic  downturns  lower  LFPR  and  should  be 
minimized  by  making  more  use  of  automatic  fiscal  stabilizers. 
Americans are trying to work, but they often face major barriers. 
And  it  is  reducing  those  barriers  and  maintaining  strong  labor 
markets that should be a policy focus. 
I look forward to any questions.

STATEMENT OF MR. JOSE ORTIZ, JR., EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, 
NEW YORK CITY EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING COALITION, 
NEW YORK, NY 
Mr. Ortiz. Good afternoon, and thank you, Chairman Lee, Sen-
ator Hassan, and Members of the Joint Economic Committee. 
My name is Jose Ortiz, Jr., and I am the Executive Director of 
the New York City Employment and Training Coalition. Every day 
the workforce development system, including our 160-member orga-
nizations that serve more than 500,000 under-served New Yorkers, 
demonstrates that given the appropriate tools to address specific 
individual and systemic challenges, people are resilient and capable 
of learning at any stage of their lives. 
The country is experiencing unprecedented economic growth. And 
while we know that talent exists everywhere, in towns, cities large 
and small, a significant percentage of people across the Nation lack 
relevant work experience and professional skill that would make 
them viable candidates for employment across industries. 
Research shows us that, while 53 percent of all jobs in today’s 
labor market are middle-skill, only 43 percent of U.S. workers are 
trained at this level, which means that industries cannot grow to 
their full potential, and American workers face highly limited path-
ways into careers with good wages. 
In addition to the moral imperative, there is an economic impera-
tive to increasing investments in workforce development. Sixty-two 
percent of small- and mid-sized business leaders reported that it is 
difficult to find skilled workers. Seventy-nine percent of these busi-
ness leaders also express their support for new public investments 
in workforce policies. 
There are roughly 75 million people who are unemployed, under- 
employed, or not working but not counted in unemployment fig-
ures. This includes (1) adults with post-secondary credentials; (2) 
adults living in poverty; (3) individuals with some college but no 
credential; and (4) young people ages 16 to 24 not in school or 
working. 
Effective workforce programs contain critical components that, 
when combined and structured to be reactive to each individual’s 
needs, provide people with deep interventions and intensive serv-
ices required to ensure successful entry and growth in a career. 
Recent data suggest that taxpayers reap as much as four dollars 
for every one dollar spent on workforce programs. 
Per Scholas, which provides tuition-free technology training to 
adults across the country, is a clear example of the impact of work-
force programs. Per Scholas’s track record includes a 400 percent 
increase  in  graduates’  post-training  income  and  an  80  percent 
placement rate into quality and stable careers in the growing tech 
field. 
Deris of Cincinnati is a 41-year-old Black man that exemplifies 
the tenacity and potential that exists in all of our communities. 
Having to drop out of college due to family obligations, Deris spent 
years in ‘‘tech adjacent’’ jobs with limited career growth.

employers has enabled him to provide much more stability for his 
family, and even prompted him to start his own business. 
In New York, there is a direct correlation with higher unemploy-
ment rates among individuals who identify as Black, Latinx, and/ 
or female, making programs like Per Scholas—whose students are 
87 percent people of color and 30 percent women—critical to closing 
that talent gap. 
However, we know that this problem is also affecting non-edu-
cated Whites across the Nation, and especially individuals with ad-
ditional challenges to employment such as criminal justice histories 
or substance abuse issues. 
To  tackle  these  challenges,  national  organizations  like  Seedco 
have targeted programs that combine in-demand skill development 
and  behavioral  and  interpersonal  growth.  Jared,  a  24-year-old 
White man born and raised in rural Arkansas with an early crimi-
nal history, sought out Seedco in Memphis, Tennessee, seeking to 
transform his life through work. 
Participating in Seedco enabled him to think critically about his 
own choices, explore viable career pathways, and led him to the 
Kingdom Low Voltage Apprenticeship Program. Jared is currently 
earning $11.50 per hour with Torey Low Voltage Communications, 
while training to become a certified telecommunications technician. 
This is significantly higher than the Tennessee minimum wage of 
$7.25. 
Employment training programs like SEEKO are not only critical 
to connecting more people to work, but are also pivotal to our Na-
tion’s ability to remain competitive in the face of automation. 
Over the next 10 years, more than 10 percent of all occupations 
can be fully automated. The same study found that 40 percent of 
all work activities have the potential to be automated using current 
demonstrated technologies. 
The largest occupational categories in the U.S. are also the ones 
with  the  greatest  potential  for  automation-related  displacement. 
Office support, construction, mining, agriculture, forestry, fishing, 
hunting, retail trade, accommodation, and food services, and manu-
facturing. The good news is that job growth will net positive over 
the next 10 years. 
As  the  stories  of  Deris  and  Jared  and  the  organizations  that 
trained and supported them along the way show, we can equip peo-
ple with 21st century skills needed to create sustainable futures for 
themselves and their families. This task is enormous. 
However, the Federal Government must ensure that workforce 
development programs like the ones highlighted and the hundreds 
that are not currently funded receive the support that they need. 
Once successful, they will raise the standard of living for all who 
reside in our towns and cities across America. Thank you.

mittee at the same time. But I have had the opportunity to listen 
and to read your testimony and hear 50 percent, I guess, of the tes-
timony. 
So, Mr. Cass, let me start with you. In reading your testimony 
and words out of your book, ‘‘The Once and Future Worker,’’ I find 
an  interesting  statement  there.  And  let  me  quote  it,  in  your 
hypotheses  that  ‘‘A  labor  market  in  which  workers  can  support 
strong families and communities is the central detriment of long- 
term prosperity and should be the central focus of public policy.’’ 
And I think about, as we were walking over here we were talking 
about child care and the expense of things. So I am trying to figure 
out, is that statement saying that the detriments are things that 
we have to do to support our families that many people cannot af-
ford? 
For example, I just read something for child care. If you have one 
child here in Washington, D.C., it can be anywhere from $2,000 to 
$2,500 for that child. If you have two children, that is more than 
some of the folks who work on my staff make. 
And so what is the answer to that statement in your book? What 
is it we should be doing in public policy? And then I am going to 
come to an opioid question for you, Mr. Ortiz, since you talked 
about drug addiction. And then, Mr. Shambaugh, I am going to 
come back with a question for you. 
Mr. Cass. Well thank you, Congresswoman. My view would be 
that our goals should be an economy and a society in which self- 
sufficient  households  can  support themselves and their families. 
And so—— 
Representative Beatty. But we know most people are not self- 
reliant or self-sufficient when we look at the number of people. I 
just left a hearing, talking about public housing, and talking about 
poverty. One in five children go to bed hungry at night. There are 
many disparities. When you think about women of color, they make 
74 cents on the dollar compared to their White male counterparts. 
So how do we get there? 
Mr. Cass. Well, as I said, I think that should be the goal, which 
means that we need to create a labor market that has better pay-
ing jobs, and prepare people to work productively in those jobs. 
I think the question of—— 
Representative Beatty. Child support? Would you say a public 
policy issue raising the minimum wage? We know for someone in 
my district to even afford a two-bedroom apartment, they need to 
make $18 an hour minimum wage. What do you think about that 
as a policy change? 
Mr. Cass. Raising the minimum wage to $18 an hour? 
Representative Beatty. Or, $15. Pick a number. 
Mr. Cass. Well I think this exercise of picking a number under-
scores exactly why I do not think that is a sensible response. I 
think  what  we  wish  people  earned  is  a  different  question  from 
whether there are likely to be jobs available. 
Representative Beatty. So let me ask it this way. Do you think 
the minimum wage that we have across the country in many of the 
communities like mine is sufficient to do what you are saying? 
Mr. Cass. I think that minimum wages should be set at the local 
level based on local labor market conditions.

Representative Beatty. And I agree with you. So in our market 
we know it is far too low. It would need to be a minimum of some-
where between $15. 
Mr. Cass. I am sorry if I as unclear. When I say ‘‘local labor 
market conditions,’’ I do not mean with reference to what things 
cost for people. I mean with reference to what the labor market can 
support. 
And so, while again we might wish that everybody were earning 
a wage that allowed them—— 
Representative  Beatty.  Oh,  I  think  the  labor  market  could 
support it. 
Mr. Cass. Well do you know what the median wage in your mar-
ket is? 
Representative Beatty. Yes. When we look at that, we know 
that there are far too many people who are not making it. But yet 
on the other hand, we know because of discrimination and some of 
the disparities that you also have people who are not being hired 
in that. So, you know, if we lived in an equal and fair world, I 
would probably agree with you. But I am going to run—— 
Mr. Cass. Well if I could say one thing just briefly, just to clar-
ify, when I asked what the median wage is, historically economists 
have  looked  to  the  median  wage.  So  what  the  person,  midway 
through the distribution, earns as a reference point for what the 
labor market can support as a minimum wage. 
And so nationwide, for instance, the median wage is still only 
about $18 an hour. There are certainly local urban markets where 
it is much higher and a much higher minimum wage could be sup-
ported. But if you have a local market where the median wage is 
$18 an hour, raising the minimum to $15 or $18—— 
Representative Beatty. No, no, I understand that. And we are 
not into that, of course. I think I have 10 seconds, so I was going 
to ask you a question, and I will get it out and I will not be able 
to get the answer from you. 
Representative Schweikert. I am hopeful you and I are going 
to have two or three rounds. 
Representative Beatty. Oh? Okay. Then I will yield back. 
Representative Schweikert. Thank you, Congresswoman. I am 
going to go off script a little bit because I actually, this is one of 
the areas I am actually fascinated with, and I have binder after 
binder. I have copies of some of your writings in those binders. I 
was not going to be particularly jerky and come in with some of 
my highlighted copies, saying many of the things we knew a year 
ago, data-wise, and I understand the last 12 months is a small 
snapshot, appear to be wrong. 
Can I give you the first—and I would like your thoughts, and it 
is not a thought experiment because it has actually happened—a 
year ago, we would all sit around this room and look at the labor 
force participation numbers of millenials. And then, come Decem-
ber, all of a sudden the BLS data had this breakout, and it had 
continued, of millenial females. Walk me through it, because I see 
that  as  an  example  of  many  of  the  things  we  often  talk  about 
policywise,  and  this  lever,  and  that  lever.  Something  happened,

labor force with millenial females a year ago December, and it con-
tinued. 
Help me understand why. Help me understand why the differen-
tial. And is it an example of the debate we have had in these rooms 
for decades of the levers we have as policymakers turns out that 
maybe the ultimate lever is availability of work? 
Doctor, what did I see in those numbers? Why the sudden sepa-
ration a year ago in millenial males and females? 
Dr. De Rugy. I actually really, although I am not a labor econo-
mist, but I think where you are right is to actually raise the possi-
bility of some skepticism of what the Federal Government can do. 
I mean, I think very often we think that the Federal Government 
has the power to achieve a lot of goals. And if we do not know ex-
actly why things are happening, and we also have a lot of evidence 
that projections often are not correct, it may actually put in jeop-
ardy this belief that the Federal Government can do as much as 
it thinks. 
Representative  Schweikert.  And  my  question  was  less 
wrapped around the normal skepticism many of us carry, but more 
if something was working how do we figure out what it was and 
do more of it. 
Mr. Cass. 
Mr. Cass. I am sorry, I do not know anything about the specific 
divergence in trends. 
Representative Schweikert. Okay. Doctor, did you see it? 
Dr. Shambaugh. Yes. I think there are a few things you can 
point at. So the first is, I think—my guess is you are referring to 
the 25- to 34-year-old group. So one thing that I do think when we 
look at that group relative to say not just a year ago, but relative 
to a few years ago, is—and this is not the positive side of it, which 
is the birth rate is down. And we do not have adequate child care 
for everyone who wants to work. And more women in the 25- to 34- 
year-olds do not have kids. It does not do it on a dime like you are 
talking about. 
Representative Schweikert. I know that that is actually up in 
the models, but that does not fit what we saw in that, because it 
is a statistically significant number. And I am just—it bothered 
me, because I have not seen anyone dive into that. 
Dr. Shambaugh. I think the other thing is, and I would say it 
is two sides to what you are saying, when the labor market is 
stronger it certainly brings more people into the labor market. And 
when you ask why is it divergent between men and women, I think 
a lot of it has to do with which parts of the U.S. labor market we 
are doing better at that time. 
And so the manufacturing and energy sides of the U.S. labor 
market have been slowing, and those are not. And so those tend 
to be more male, and that has the whole side lifting—— 
Representative  Schweikert.  The  model  would  not—look,  I 
know you are freaky smart. I have you in my binders in lots of 
places. But that would not equate to suddenly slowing down, and 
then females suddenly exploding. It was not—the differential was 
growth in actual participation. 
Dr. Shambaugh. I would say one last piece, and this I mean 
with all seriousness, which is: we always worry when we see, the

women’s one was actually coming down a little bit when we did not 
expect it to in the months before that, and then it surged a little. 
And so I think there is also some noise in the data. 
Representative  Schweikert.  That  is  very  possible.  But  the 
trend has continued now for almost, what, three-plus quarters. And 
it is statistically significant. 
Mr. Ortiz—and I will do this with a quick anecdote, which I de-
spise when there are bells in this Committee because I believe we 
have an obligation to do big-picture policy. Labor market, Phoenix, 
Arizona. We are stunningly blessed right now. But when we visit, 
when I visit like our homeless campus, they have a stack of jobs 
there with St. Joseph’s the Worker, and the problem was not avail-
able labor, it was transportation. We just put together an experi-
mental project with, I think it is the company Lyft, to actually 
cover that transportation gap. 
If you were to think of outliers that are the barriers for the par-
ticipation of so many of those you have worked with, how often is 
it actually transportation, and those types of attributes, and not 
some of the things we would often immediately move to? 
Mr. Ortiz. So I appreciate the question. There are a number of 
barriers and transportation is included in that. Child care is one 
of the ones that came up. In New York City, and I cannot speak 
to obviously the specific experience that you are talking about in 
Arizona, but in New York City there are transit deserts, locations 
that require multiple subways and/or buses in order to get someone 
to  work.  So  there  is  a  statistical  connection  and  correlation  for 
someone who is further away from employment opportunities and 
higher poverty rates. 
Representative Schweikert. Okay. And, forgive me, I know I 
am over, but, Congresswoman, you can take all the time you—well, 
within reason. But it is interesting that maybe in our pockets was 
actually one of the solutions. There is a little button for ride shar-
ing that actually may actually be the way we cover parts of at least 
that gap. 
Congresswoman, please. 
Representative Beatty. Thank you. Mr. Ortiz, let me go to you. 
One of the things that I picked up in your testimony is the impor-
tance of partnerships. As you described, it is governments at all 
levels, business, educational institutions, organized labor and non-
profits have a role to play. Through those partnerships, we can 
identify the skills that will be in demand in the future, and then 
help people build up on those skills. 
Can you discuss the importance of—how the importance of col-
laborative partner-centric approach is to boosting the labor market 
outcomes? Which models have been especially effective to you? 
Mr. Ortiz. Well I would just emphasize in terms of just in gen-
eral, in terms of partnerships to start, that no one organization has 
all of the assets and skills to be able to do everything that is re-
quired to make a labor market go. 
And I think what we are experiencing in the workforce system 
is that we need to have strong partnerships not just with the busi-
nesses at the association level, but we need to understand real-time 
data coming from employers to better understand the implications 
on the type of training that is required.

When  it  comes  to  the  workforce  development  partners  them-
selves, those that are actually executing and providing the training, 
even them, some of them are more specifically focused on the skills 
development, while others are providing the supportive services, 
the wraparound services that are important for someone to be suc-
cessful in a program. 
And of course we need to work more closely with the government 
to better understand where they can—how we can better inform 
policy, where we can direct some of those investments to help boost 
the economy and the labor market. 
But ultimately I think what we are trying—when we say ‘‘part-
nerships,’’ what we are essentially saying is the most effective pro-
grams that are the ones that are working with multiple layers of 
organization. As the employers, they are—you know, the programs 
are being driven by employer-informed data in real time. They are 
working closely with government to scale their programs. They are 
funded in multiple ways, et cetera. 
Representative Beatty. Thank you. And, Mr. Shambaugh, let 
me go to you. I read something in your testimony that says: Im-
proving workers’ pay, schedules, bargaining powers, workers rights, 
that in these jobs it makes it more—if they are more stable with 
those  skills,  it  could  help.  Were  you  talking  about  unions?  It 
sounds like some of the language. Because if so—and if not, you 
can answer it—do you think that has any effect on, we have seen 
somewhat of a decrease in participation with some of the unions? 
Dr. Shambaugh. Thank you for the question. I think unions are 
certainly one way to get workers better bargaining power. I think 
there  are—private-sector  unions  play  a  much  smaller  role  than 
they used to. Their membership has declined as a share of private- 
sector workers, and that certainly reduces the bargaining power of 
regular workers. 
I think there are other things, whether it is getting rid of non- 
compete contracts, getting rid of no-poach agreements within fran-
chises, whether it is wage transparency, many things that are pub-
lic policy rules we could take steps we could take that would really 
strengthen the bargaining power of workers and give them an op-
portunity to have somewhat more stable, better-paying jobs. And 
here is where I agree very much with Mr. Cass, that having better 
jobs here is one of the ways to keep more people in the labor mar-
ket. Because right now what we see is them cycling in and out a 
lot, because the jobs are not very stable. They cannot hold on to 
them very long, and that is not a good environment to support a 
family or just to stay in the labor market. 
Representative Beatty. To piggyback on my colleague’s ques-
tion about the women, maybe if we look at what the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics has reported with the surge of women who are 
Baby Boomers, it increased then. So it opened the door for what 
may have been very difficult for me coming along. I would not have 
thought of STEM. That did not exist. We would not have thought 
about leading a construction demolition, or even an engineer. 
So when you look at what the Bureau of Labor Statistics is say-
ing up to the year 2024, that there is going to be another surge. 
And many of them will be the millenial women because they do not 
know that they could not have those opportunities. Because I think

we have done such a great job there. I think that is another reason 
I  asked  the  question,  because  they  come  in  wanting  the  same 
things that we have to wait to a certain age to get. 
You know, they drive the same cars. They live in condos. They 
do not do rooming houses, and used cars that are 20 years old that 
was handed-me-down. So I think you are going to see a surge, be-
cause we have opened the door, thank goodness, for women to be 
able to be anything they want to be. 
And I think that is in part why in 2024 it looks like there is 
going to be a surge, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, of 
77  percent,  giving  us  an  overall  of  like  almost  48  percent  of 
millenials and young women in the labor market. 
So, thank you. 
Chairman Lee. We will turn next to Senator Hassan. 
Senator Hassan. Well thank you, Mr. Chair, for the courtesy. 
And again thank you to the panelists for being here, and apologies 
for the interruptions of Senate votes. 
So, Mr. Shambaugh, I wanted to start with a question to you. 
Families are often left making what is an impossible choice be-
tween earning a paycheck and spending time with a loved one in 
need, or taking care of their own personal health care crisis. 
And we know that women are often the ones who meet these 
care-giving needs. As I mentioned earlier, the recent study that you 
did with the Hamilton Project reported that far more women say 
that they remain out of the labor force because of their family and 
home obligations than men do. 
Eight states and Washington, D.C., have enacted paid family and 
medical leave policies to provide partial wages—partial wage re-
placement to workers who need to care for a newborn or a newly 
adopted child, provide care for a family member in need, or address 
their own health care crisis. 
So, Mr. Shambaugh, based on your research, do policies like paid 
family and medical leave help improve labor participation rates? 
And could they help close the gender gap in labor participation? 
Dr. Shambaugh. I think what we know about—thank you for 
the question. I think it is incredibly important. And as we men-
tioned, you know, a huge chunk of the people out of the labor force 
who are prime age are people taking care of family members. 
And so trying to think about how to deal with that is important. 
As we said, and I think you know, some of them are choosing to 
do so by choice. It is a choice, right? And there are people who 
want to be home taking care of someone. But it is the case that 
roughly 35, or depending how you measure more percent of women 
who are not in the labor force but want a job. They say this is the 
problem. 
And so I think on the one hand, yes, there is very good evidence 
that well-designed parental leave policies can help keep women en-
gaged to the labor force. I think they also, frankly, have huge bene-
fits to families and children, as well, and to infants. And so they 
are positive in their own right, but they also can have, if designed 
right, positive labor force impacts. 
And then I think the child care side is the other very huge one, 
which is we do spend a lot of money as a government on child care. 
We just don’t necessarily direct it towards the families who need

the help the most for whom it really becomes the barrier to work. 
And I think that is a place we could do a lot more. 
Senator Hassan. Well that makes a lot of sense. I just came 
from a subcommittee hearing looking at the challenges of the grow-
ing incidence of Alzheimers, and the care-giving population is often 
wives, daughters, and they are not in the labor pool because they 
cannot be, and we do not recognize it. And that is a whole other 
category, I think. 
I wanted to follow up with another issue, which is housing. So, 
Mr. Shambaugh, I travel all around my State and I constantly hear 
from businesses about the challenges they have in recruiting work-
ers. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, in 
New Hampshire a family would need to make $23.23 an hour to 
afford a two-bedroom rental. That is the equivalent of 3.2 minimum 
wage jobs. And the vacancy rate for rentals is far below the na-
tional average, making it harder for individuals to find and main-
tain housing in the communities where they work. 
Unstable housing can be a significant barrier to finding stable 
employment and staying in the labor market. So in your view what 
are the most important things we should be doing to make it easier 
for workers to find and keep safe, stable, and affordable housing? 
Dr.  Shambaugh.  Thank  you  for  the  question.  I  think  it  is 
hugely important that we now have a lot of trouble having enough 
housing near where there are jobs. And that is a serious constraint 
on people’s ability to move, and it is a serious constraint on their 
ability to find work. 
And so I think local land use restrictions, unfortunately they are 
not the purview of this Committee because they fall at the local 
level often, although I think there are Federal steps that could be 
taken, but they often prevent enough housing from being built in 
the places where there are jobs. And that is a real serious con-
straint. 
I think there is also the fact that housing vouchers and aid for 
housing are drastically in excess demand relative to the supply, 
and people have to wait a long time to get help for housing. And 
so that can be a constraint, as well. 
But I think the issue of making sure people can live near where 
there are jobs is a big part of why some people are not working. 
Senator Hassan. Well I thank you for that. We have our overall 
housing vacancy rate in New Hampshire is less than one percent, 
and it is making it, at all levels, extraordinarily difficult to get peo-
ple to move in and take jobs. 
So thank you for your work. I am just about out of time, and I 
know, Mr. Ortiz, you had been addressing the importance of wrap-
around services as we help people pursue credentials or degrees. I 
will follow up with a question to the record just to make sure I get 
your full answer on that. 
To all of the panel, I really appreciate your work and your will-
ingness to be with us today. Thank you. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Occupational licensing, as you have acknowledged, continues to 
be a significant impediment for a lot of people getting into the 
workforce. And it also tends, I think, to be something of a barrier 
to interstate mobility, which in turn keeps a lot of people out of the 
workforce, or at least in career paths that are perhaps less ful-
filling or less remunerative than they would be otherwise. 
Now a lot of states—and this is an interesting topic for us to dis-
cuss here, because we have almost no authority over occupational 
licensing here, just as we have almost no authority over residential 
zoning and things like that. We do have some authority at the mar-
gins. I have tried to highlight the problem and underscore the need 
for reform in this area by exercising what authority we have. 
We have got plenary lawmaking authority under the so-called 
Enclave Clause, Clause 17 of Article I, Section 8, over the District 
of Columbia and other Federal enclaves. It is why in the last Con-
gress I introduced something called ‘‘The Allow Act,’’ which would 
use Congress’ Federal jurisdiction over D.C. and Federal enclaves 
to bring out needed occupational reforms. 
What other Federal changes, if any, would you suggest in helping 
us to try to address the burden of excessive occupational licensing? 
Any other ideas on that, as far as what Congress could do? Or are 
they all at the State level? 
Dr. De Rugy. Thank you for this question. I am actually really 
reluctant of using the Federal Government to micro manage State 
and local affairs. As costly as it a problem, I think this may be a 
case, again apart from information, putting out reports, which is 
not without value, I do not know that the Federal Government, un-
fortunately, has a lot of things to do. That said, there have been 
very successful challenges for occupational licensing barriers before 
the Supreme Court. Hopefully there will be more of them. 
There is some good news because it does look like some states 
are actually really seriously looking into the issue. Arizona, I mean 
passed the first step into actually opening the door to the transfer-
ability of licenses. It is not perfect, because my understanding is 
that, you know, you can come and work in Arizona, but then at 
some point you have to get the Arizona license. I am not sure about 
this, but I think there is some of this. 
So, you know, it could be that the Federal Government could put 
out information about best practices in that regard. But again, un-
fortunately I come here and tell you these are like really big, big 
problems, but I do not know that you can really do very much 
about it. 
Chairman Lee. I assume you would not disagree with me on 
our  Enclave  Clause  authority,  though.  We  have  got  authority 
over—— 
Dr. De Rugy. Yes, if you have authority—— 
Chairman Lee [continuing]. Federal property on military bases. 
Dr. De Rugy. But I mean in D.C. with child care, for instance, 
we have been like talking about the cost of child care. The cost of 
child care is absolutely increased quite dramatically in D.C. be-
cause of the lack of supply of health care brought on by vocational 
licensing requirements that are quite stringent. And, that keep out 
low-income, low-education people.

Chairman Lee. Is Arizona, the State you have identified, at the 
cutting edge of this? 
Dr. De Rugy. To my knowledge, this is the State that has actu-
ally taken the broader steps. And again, it is only a first step. 
There is way more to do. For instance, they need to reform their 
own licensing system within the State, which is still too burden-
some. Because the problem is like the progression of vocational li-
censing since the 1950s has been quite dramatic, and as a result 
it has included a lot of low-income workers and low-paid jobs. And 
that is problematic for income mobility. It is problematic at many 
levels. And there is a new study that just came out that actually 
looked at the welfare effect of vocational licensing, and it showed 
that, while they increase the wages and the hours of the people 
within  the  industry  who  already  have  their  license,  it  actually 
keeps employment down for those who do not. 
Chairman Lee. So it is classic protectionist. 
Dr. De Rugy. It is absolutely. 
Chairman Lee. It is a government-sponsored welfare system, 
using the overwhelming force of the State in order to protect the 
wealthy and the well-connected at the expense of the poor and mid-
dle class. 
Dr. De Rugy. And it may be a case, right, for a high-risk, high-
er-risk professions like the medical practice, though there is that 
question  about  whether  actually  occupational  licensing  require-
ments do increase the quality of the work. 
But it is just hard to imagine that the State or the local govern-
ment have, you know, to protect us against nonmatching pillows or 
something like this. 
Chairman Lee. Right, right. I mean, that could be bad. If some-
body recommends matching an unlicensed, unscrupulous interior 
decorator that gives you clashing pillows—— 
Dr. De Rugy. Yeah, well, I do not think it would actually come 
up like a very strong number on the national data, but, yeah. 
Chairman Lee. That is a fair point. I had a constituent a few 
years ago make the following observation and I want to see if you 
agree with this. The observation was, in those professions where 
you can identify in the abstract the greatest need for occupational 
licensing, where there is the greatest potential health and public 
safety threat as a result of someone practicing outside of something 
they know how to do, in those same areas the occupational license 
seems to be the least significant factor. 
The examples that were given to me by this constituent included 
the fact that, apparently if you get a pilot’s license, once you are 
a pilot, in theory you could fly a 747. Whether or not you can fly 
a particular 747 is going to be up to the owner of that 747. 
So, too, with a medical degree. In theory, you are licensed to 
practice medicine, which might include delivering a baby, doing 
heart surgery, or brain surgery, or removing a wart. But whether 
or not you know how to do any of those things may not be deter-
mined  as  much  by  your  State-issued  occupational  license  as  by 
your particular credentialing and training that you have received 
from private organizations rather than a State. 
Would you agree with that? 
Dr. De Rugy. Agree.

Chairman  Lee.  Mr.  Cass,  let’s  talk  about  marriage  for  a 
minute, the marriage and family formation. It seems to me there 
might be kind of a chicken and egg problem, and I want you to help 
me unravel this. 
Like you, I am concerned that if more men cannot find stable, 
steady work, the result is likely to be fewer marriages, in the first 
instance; more divorces in the second instance. But it is not also 
likely that to the extent that marriage is collapsing, that marriage 
rates are falling, men in general will tend to feel less pressure, less 
of a need to be bread winners, or to be involved in the lives of their 
children, and that in turn could translate into more unemployment, 
less stable family lives, and other societal and economic problems. 
Would you agree with that? 
Mr. Cass. Yeah, I think that is certainly true. 
Chairman Lee. One of the things I am always looking to do in 
this Committee, because, you know, it is my belief that institutions 
of civil society and free markets cannot be created by government. 
Certainly families are no exception to the principle that a govern-
ment cannot create an institution of civil society. 
Governments can, however, weaken those institutions. And once 
it weakens them, where it has weakened them, government is not 
necessarily very good at turning the switch back on. 
Are there areas you would point to that you think represent the 
sort of lowest-hanging fruit of where we could identify that the 
Federal Government is impeding marriage or family formation? 
Mr. Cass. Yeah, thank you for that question. I think the way 
you have put the problem is exactly right; that in a sense we have 
a  vicious  cycle  where  declining  economic  opportunities  and  out-
comes harm family formation and, in turn, the culture that is de-
valuing and de-emphasizing family formation that potentially in 
turn harms economic engagement. 
I  think  for  policymakers  the  question,  when  you  encounter  a 
cycle like—well, the challenge when you encounter a cycle like that 
is to not just throw up your hands and say, well, that looks like 
a big mess. 
And instead, the question is to say: Well, where in that cycle is 
there potentially an opportunity to intervene? It seems to me there 
is very little potential to intervene directly on the cultural side 
through simply reasserting through public policy the importance of 
family formation—though with respect to the bully pulpit it cer-
tainly helps to talk about it. 
But conversely, the labor market side offers I think a very salient 
opportunity to intervene. I think to the extent that things have got-
ten worse, to the extent that we could imagine a world in which 
things got better, that is a world in which you would not imme-
diately turn the cycle on its head and solve all the problems, but 
you would expect to slow the cycle, and you would expect to have 
better outcomes than we do today. 
And so I think that is why, rather than getting hung up on ex-
actly how much of the problem we can attribute to what, and how 
much of the causation runs in each direction, we should be asking 
where can policy help? Where do we think it would be likely to sup-
port stronger families? And I think a stronger labor market is that 
place.

Chairman Lee. Mr. Schweikert. 
Representative Schweikert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let’s 
engage in a little bit of the speed round. 
Mr. Ortiz, and then let’s go across. If I came to you right now 
and said give me your three wish lists that you think would have 
the most impact on having our brothers and sisters who are not in 
the labor force enter stable work, what would those three be? And 
I am going to ask everyone the same thing. 
Mr. Ortiz. I would certainly start by saying that we need to in-
vest more in areas that are called bridge programs. 
Representative Schweikert. Okay, bridge programs. 
Mr. Ortiz. Bridge programs are certainly an area of high focus 
for our organization and the populations that we often serve. 
Supportive services, of course, are of vital importance. So you ref-
erenced earlier transportation, child care, et cetera. 
Representative Schweikert. Okay, so—— 
Mr. Ortiz. So supportive services are certainly going to take up 
a number of those issues that we say that that is two, three, and 
many more. 
Representative Schweikert. Okay. Alright, Doctor? 
Dr. Shambaugh. I would start with child care, just because it 
is the largest number of people. Spurring labor demand in strug-
gling regions where there is just not enough demand for labor and 
labor force participation. 
Representative Schweikert. Okay, so regional differentiation. 
Dr. Shambaugh. And I would say, with programs that try to 
raise returns to work for people at the low end of the educational 
spectrum. So training and education that try to boost people and 
get them into better jobs. 
Representative Schweikert. Okay, Mr. Cass. 
Mr. Cass. I would say first realigning our education policies to 
emphasize non-college pathways over college pathways. 
Second, reforming our approach to organized labor to create a 
system that people actually want to participate in, and that helps 
bring people into the work force. 
And third, rethinking our approach to globalization in a way that 
actually constrains access to workers outside of this country and fo-
cuses firms on using the workers who are here. 
Representative Schweikert. Interesting. 
Doctor. 
Dr. De Rugy. Dramatically increase the supply of housing. 
I would say criminal justice reform is a big impediment to people 
entering the workforce. 
And just lifting like work, labor requirements, or licensing re-
quirements would be I guess my three. But there are many more. 
Representative Schweikert. Just to be clear, you do not mean 
the reform is the impediment, just the—— 
Dr. De Rugy. No, no, the—I mean I could—— 
Representative Schweikert. I just did not want to get blamed 
for that one. 
Dr.  De  Rugy  [continuing].  Medical  and  legalize  some  of  the 
drugs, just to stir the pot. 
Representative Schweikert. You do stir. Okay, now actually

predicting my fixation on millenial males in labor force participa-
tion, for that one population segment, what would be the number 
one thing you would do to encourage that population to participate? 
Dr. De Rugy. So I do not know very much about that popu-
lation, so—— 
Representative Schweikert. Okay. 
Mr. Cass. 
Mr. Cass. Non-college pathways. 
Representative Schweikert. Non-college pathways. 
Doctor. 
Dr. Shambaugh. Increase wages for that demographic, for the 
people with less education. 
Representative Schweikert. Okay. We need to talk, because I 
think there is noise in particularly in the last 12 months’ data that 
wages have been going up. That is actually partially true of fe-
males, and I do not know why I have not seen the same thing in 
the male side, but that is more of a geeky conversation. 
Mr. Ortiz. 
Mr. Ortiz.  I  would  agree  with  non-college  pathways  being  of 
high importance. 
Representative Schweikert. For anyone that is listening, we 
have actually sort of in our office fixated on this subject, and we 
have built a list of many things. But you do understand, when we 
talk about non-college pathways, it is everything from, you know, 
types of votech type training at the high school level, all the way 
to are we ready to have a real uncomfortable conversation on ac-
creditation at the university level that the university is able to pro-
vide a degree at 20 months, but it is solely training you to be able 
to have productivity in society, and you may not, you know, have 
great  understanding  of  great  literature.  And  we  have  actually 
made proposals on that, and it is fascinating the incumbent class, 
which—I mean incumbent systems, and regulators, and those who 
come crashing down in here, defending the accreditation systems, 
or accrediting. 
I will agree with all of you, there are ways to get there. It is 
shocking, though, how much of the bureaucracy around us is actu-
ally at war with you on all of your ideas. 
And with that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman Lee. Senator Cruz. 
Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to each of 
the witnesses for being here. 
Dr. De Rugy, tomorrow the Export-Import Bank’s authorization 
is set to expire. Unfortunately, when it comes to the Export-Import 
Bank, virtually all of my Democratic colleagues and an awful lot 
of my Republican colleagues have been eager to continue the Ex- 
Im Bank in operation. 
Many of us had been quite critical of the Ex-Im Bank, that it 
serves as a vehicle for chronyism and for giving corporate welfare 
to giant companies on the backs of, and with the financial risk and 
exposure of the American taxpayers. 
Can you give this Committee a breakdown of which types of ben-
efits—businesses benefited from the Ex-Im when its Board of Di-
rectors had a quorum versus which types of businesses benefited 
when Ex-Im’s board lacked a quorum?

Dr. De Rugy. So thank you for this question. So the last time 
we had a full year with a quorum for the Export-Import Bank was 
in 2014 with the whole year data, and by then roughly, on the do-
mestic side, 65 percent of the benefit went to 10 large manufac-
turer, 40 percent went to Boeing, alone. 
On the foreign side, it was as big companies, many foreign air-
lines. But what was more striking is that 30 percent of the bank’s 
activity went to 10 state-owned enterprises. So foreign-owned com-
panies. If you look at the period from 2007 to 2014, the main bene-
ficiary overall was Pemex, the oil and gas state-owned enterprises. 
And in 2014 alone it was Air China. 
So basically Air China was the top beneficiary of the Export-Im-
port Bank on the foreign side. 
During the time where the quorum did not allow the bank to ex-
tend loans above $10 million, what ended up happening is basically 
a lot of the big guys were excluded from the benefits, though not 
entirely. Their benefits fell by 93 percent. And the share of small 
business benefiting from the Small Business Administration—from 
Ex-Im went from 20 percent to roughly 40 percent, even though as 
a whole the amount they received went down. 
And so Air China was, you know, not a beneficiary anymore. The 
share of state-owned, of the Ex-Im that went to the 10 top state- 
owned enterprise fell down, went from $6 billion to just a few mil-
lions. And Boeing was, you know, hardly a beneficiary. 
And it is interesting to say that during that time there was a lot 
of innovation in the capital market that exports continued going 
up, and apparently there was, as predicted, no—the sky did not 
fall. 
Senator Cruz. So there was a lot of substance in your answer. 
Let’s see if we can break out a couple of pieces of it. One of the 
things, if I understood your testimony correctly, was that in 2014, 
right before Ex-Im lost its quorum, that support to Boeing, one 
company, comprised 40 percent of the total outlays? I guess that 
is one of the reasons it has been referred to before as ‘‘Boeing’s 
Bank.’’ 
Dr. De Rugy. Yeah. 
Senator Cruz. Although that raises questions why a giant cor-
poration needs the U.S. taxpayers subsidizing its businesses. 
If I understand you correctly, without a quorum a much higher 
percentage of Ex-Im’s funds went to small businesses who were al-
ways put forward as the desired beneficiaries, except for the fact 
that  when  it  is  fully  authorized  and  has  a  quorum  that  is  not 
where the money goes. 
Dr. De Rugy. No, the money goes roughly—it is roughly 20 per-
cent goes to small businesses before 2014, and even the majority, 
something like 89 percent of transactions went to small businesses, 
when you actually follow the money it is really only 20 percent. 
And, yes, and it is worth saying that Boeing did really well during 
those four years where they did not have a quorum. They sold more 
planes. Their backlog increased. 
Senator Cruz. So the American taxpayers are on the hook giv-
ing Boeing a subsidy that it does not need. 
Let me take the second piece of your question, which I think is 
really important for people to hear. You said a major beneficiary

of Ex-Im’s funds and benefits when it has a quorum are state- 
owned enterprises, including state-owned enterprises for countries 
like China. 
So the American taxpayers are subsidizing companies owned by 
the Chinese Government? Is that right? 
Dr. De Rugy. Yes. 
Senator Cruz. Does that make any sense? 
Dr. De Rugy. I do not think it does, but I—I do not think it 
does, especially in the context of a lot of people now making the 
claim that the renewed support for the Export-Import Bank comes 
from the fact that it can be used as a tool to fight China. Consid-
ering that what really the Export-Import Bank does is basically to 
compete with the other export credit agencies in high-income na-
tions where China is. So I do not think it makes any sense. 
Senator Cruz. Well in the Senate, every single Democrat sup-
ports continuing the Ex-Im Bank, and about half of the Repub-
licans do. And I certainly hope some of the Members in this body 
will  listen  to  your  testimony  and  the  evidence  you  have  given. 
Thank you. 
Dr. De Rugy. Thank you. 
Chairman Lee. I want to follow up on the point made by Sen-
ator Cruz about the Export-Import Bank, and particularly with re-
gard to Pemex, the state-owned energy company owned by Mexico. 
It is an interesting dynamic there. There is a term used exclu-
sively in Mexico. The term is Huachicolero. I do not know whether 
you have ever heard of this term. It is a term used specifically to 
describe one who steals fuel from a pipeline. And in Mexico, it is 
always a Pemex pipeline, because Pemex is the fuel company in 
Mexico. 
They steal fuel from a pipeline owned by Pemex, and then they 
sell it back onto the black market, often at a discounted price rel-
ative to what they would pay retail. 
The  origin  of  the  term,  including  the  ‘‘c-o-l’’  portion  of 
Huachicolero, refers to alcohol. Originally this came from people 
adding distilled alcohol, ethanol, to fuel in order to dilute it. I find 
it rich with ironies or coincidences, or whatever you want to call 
it,  that  our  own  Government  is  now  involved  in  the  process  of 
being a gigantic Huachicolero on one side of the border through its 
awful, absurd policies with regard to ethanol. 
And on the other side of the border, it is fueling, it is subsidizing 
Huachicoleros  through  the  Export-Import  Bank,  through  Pemex 
which you have identified as the number one beneficiary of the Ex-
port-Import Bank. 
So you are an economist and a good one, one of the very best in 
the country. I am just a politician and a poor country lawyer from 
Utah. Can you tell me if I would be incorrect to state that I think 
there  is  a  logical  connection  between  our  fueling  of  Pemex  and 
Pemex’s fueling of Huachicoleros and the elicit drug cartel activity 
that surrounds that? 
Could we be perpetuating that, and perhaps helping Pemex to 
avoid dealing with these corruption problems and the theft from its 
pipelines?

Dr. De Rugy. Well certainly, I mean just the fact that it is a 
state-owned company and it is apparently a monopoly, means that 
it is not subjected to market forces as much as it should. 
And it is also true that lowering their borrowing costs, whether— 
I mean, I assume that it is because they are buying GE products, 
or they are not buying Boeing planes, they are buying GE products, 
or Caterpillar, or what have you, that money is fungible. So those 
lower costs mean basically we are helping this company that has 
had massive amount of problems with corruption stay in place. 
I mean I know the original intent of using Ex-Im to fund Pemex 
was that they were hoping it would help them move toward privat-
ization, but that obviously is—— 
Chairman Lee. Yeah, how has that worked out for us? 
Dr. De Rugy. It has not worked out. 
Chairman Lee. In fact—— 
Dr. De Rugy. Which I do not also think it is the role of the Fed-
eral Government to actually pursue such roles. 
Chairman  Lee.  Sure,  sure.  In  fact,  when  President  Lopez 
Obrador was sworn into office almost exactly a year ago, a substan-
tial portion of his seemingly six-hour speech was devoted to his de-
sire to preserve Pemex and maintain it as a state-owned enter-
prise. 
I found that surprising. I did not know that this was that big of 
a political issue there. Apparently, it is. But one has to wonder 
why. And one has to wonder what we are doing to perpetuate this 
ring of illicit activity. What we might be doing to make it more pos-
sible. 
If a private company here, let’s say if Chevron, or Exxon-Mobil, 
or some other company that sells gasoline and diesel fuel, had that 
big of a problem as they have with Huachicoleros in Mexico, they 
would adopt different security protocols. They would figure out a 
way to stop the theft. That is not to say that fuel theft does not 
occur in the United States, it does, but not so much so that we 
have coined a noun and a verb and an adjective after it. 
And it appears to me that we are fueling a very significant prob-
lem on the south of our border, and one with impacts here. 
Mr. Cass, Yuval Levin wrote in his outstanding book ‘‘Fractured 
Republic’’ that, quote, ‘‘Worker protections in the coming decades 
will need to take the form of portable, individualized benefits and 
rights that are not attached to work places in ways that assume 
long-term employment relationships. They will need to help make 
a diffuse labor market more secure, rather than trying to reverse 
its diffusion.’’ Close quote. 
Would you agree with that statement? 
Mr. Cass. I would. And I would emphasize that the U.S. system 
of organized labor is really quite odd by international standards. 
Chairman Lee. What would you do to address that issue? 
Mr. Cass. So if you step back and look at how, for instance, 
labor unions typically work in Europe, I think the general impres-
sion is that in Europe it is a much more sort of left-leaning envi-
ronment. All of Europe is right-to-work. The idea that you would 
vote in your single factory whether or not to have a union, and 
then if you do everybody is in the union, does not exist.

Instead, they have what I would say is a much more effective 
system that is both much more local and much more national. At 
the broader more national end, what they have are effectively na-
tional unions that are more like membership organizations that 
people join voluntarily because they receive benefits from them, 
training, in some cases social support. And then down at the local 
level, they have what are, for instance, in Germany called Works 
Councils, which is a much more collaborative, less adversarial rela-
tionship  between  the  firm  management  and  workers  within  the 
firm. 
And so you essentially  at  the  local  level collaborate to  try  to 
make the company work better for everyone’s benefit, and at the 
national  level  you  have  what  is  typically  called  ‘‘sectoral  bar-
gaining’’ where you have negotiation over terms and conditions for 
let’s say janitors in the entire region. And so the sides get together 
and agree on that. And it is not a contentious firm-by-firm fight. 
And so there are a lot of models. There are a lot of variations 
to think about. I think the important thing to recognize is that I 
think most would say it works a lot better than what we have. And 
unfortunately there is an intractable obstacle here in the United 
States, which is a single provision in the National Labor Relations 
Act called ‘‘Section 882’’ which prohibits any sort of organized labor 
activity outside of the confines of these standard American unions. 
And so you could just get rid of that. Anyone who wanted the 
kind of union we have now could still have one. But if you got rid 
of that, you would also begin to open up the choice to do other 
things. And I think that that would be an important first step in 
moving toward a better system. 
Chairman Lee. Why do we have 882? And what would be the 
disadvantage of getting rid of it? 
Mr. Cass. So 882 was put in as part of the—the NLRA was 
passed in 1935 at the height of the Great Depression, at a time of 
incredible labor conflict, and there was great concern about what 
was called at the time ‘‘company unions,’’ which was the idea that 
essentially firms would subvert genuine efforts to organize by in-
stead kind of locking employees into something controlled by the 
management, and thereby foreclose the other kinds of organizing 
activity that wanted to be facilitated. 
I think that is much less of a concern today. As I said, especially 
if you do it in the context of other reforms, you can bring in other 
substitutes that are better. And I think just as a concrete example, 
it  is  fascinating  to  look  at  what  happened  in  Tennessee  where 
Volkswagen’s plant is not unionized. Volkswagen is so desperately 
wanting to bring in this European style works council structure 
that they actually tried to persuade and support—they supported 
the union and tried to persuade the workers to vote in the union 
so they could do the works council. And the workers voted it down 
twice anyway. 
That is how toxic our existing system has become, and how rel-
atively more attractive our alternatives are that could be out there. 
Chairman Lee. We are unfortunately going to have to wrap up 
here in a moment.

you think we could bump up the labor force participation rate, and 
if so how high? Is, for example, 65 percent plausible? Why don’t 
you just weigh in each briefly on that. 
Mr. Ortiz. 
Mr. Ortiz. We can—I would not, you know, I am not a trained 
economist so I cannot speak to a specific percentage in that sense, 
but I would certainly say that we can certainly bump it up with 
pointed investments in specific populations. 
Chairman Lee. What would we consider a success? At what 
level? We are at 63.3 percent right now. Is that right? 
Mr. Ortiz. Like I said, I do not think I can speak to a specific 
percentage there with any accuracy. 
Chairman Lee. Dr. Shambaugh. 
Dr. Shambaugh. I would say I think there is room for the labor 
force participation rate to rise. I think demographics are pushing 
it down. We know that as the population ages we do not expect the 
85-year-olds to work, and there are more of them. So the number 
comes down. 
But I think demographics are putting maybe a quarter point a 
year downward pressure. And so when we are treading water, we 
are kind of winning—we are at least fighting demographics to a 
draw. And when it is rising a little, we are doing even better. 
So I think it could rise. I think it would be hard to get to 65 real-
ly fast. But I think if you look at, you know, frankly, if you look 
at certain cohorts of, as we talked about, younger women are work-
ing a lot more than women of previous generations. There is no 
reason over time that you could not see the labor force participa-
tion rate rise overall, especially if we did some of the things we 
talked about here today that would help some of the people who 
have become disconnected from work back into the labor force, and 
help people who are cycling in and out stay in more permanently 
so they are not kind of occasionally counted as out. 
So I do not think there is any reason you could not get it that 
high. 
Chairman Lee. Mr. Cass. 
Mr. Cass. I do not think of it in terms of the overall labor force 
participation  rate  because  obviously  you  have  the  demographic 
pressure. Even within prime age workers, I think it is very impor-
tant  to  separate  men  from  women.  Because  as  we  have  talked 
about, there are some women who would really like to enter the 
labor force. But polls consistently show that an overwhelming ma-
jority of Americans, of women and of women with children, prefer 
an arrangement where, particularly when women have young chil-
dren, they are not working full-time. 
And so setting some arbitrary 100 percent is the idea for women 
in the workforce is not necessarily right. In fact, you could say the 
ideal is lower than it is now. 
For men’s prime-age labor force participation, I think that is ex-
actly  where  policymakers  should  be  focused.  And  I  think  Dr. 
Shambaugh offered a really good way of thinking about it earlier 
when he pointed out that for men with a college degree, that num-
ber is up 94, 95 percent. 
There is no logical reason in a healthy labor market why that 
number should not be as high as higher for people with lower lev-

els of education. And so I would say trying to bring that up toward 
95 percent, you know, in the 1950s and 1960s it was 98 percent, 
I believe—— 
Chairman Lee. Meaning men with a college degree? 
Mr. Cass. For all men. 
Chairman Lee. For all men. 
Mr. Cass. So bringing prime age men back up above 95 percent 
and doing it regardless of education level I think is the right place 
to focus. 
Dr. De Rugy. So I do think that there is space to improve. I also 
think that it is—I am less worried—I think women are going to— 
I mean I know it has slowed down but I think there is a chance 
it is going to pick up. And so it is interesting to look at the men, 
the working age men, but it is also important, and your Committee 
actually put out a really interesting report on this issue, when try-
ing to actually understand what kind of policies can be put in place 
to understand the motives of people who actually have dropped out 
of the labor force, and whether there are reasons to worry or not. 
So obviously the fact that some people have retired, I think it is 
roughly  7  percent  of  people  who  have  dropped  out  of  the  labor 
force, that people who are at school I think is 18 percent. There is 
close to, I think it is 44 or 45 percent who are disabled. 
I mean these are like it seems a good reason to not be there. 
There are 23 percent ‘‘other’’ reasons for being inactive. But one of 
the numbers from that report that I thought was really striking in 
actually trying to think about what kind of policy to put in place 
is actually when asked who wanted a job, right, when you looked 
at the able-bodied, only 12 percent of those said they wanted a job. 
And when you looked at the entire population, only 23 percent 
said. So when you have 75 percent of that population that has 
dropped out of the labor force and says they do not want a job, you 
have to actually think about why that is. 
So if they are retired, if they are in school, there is nothing to 
worry about. If for instance like some studies have shown, the dis-
ability and kind of the not differentiating between being disabled 
and being completely incapacitated create a detachment from the 
workforce, that could be a reason to worry about. But then again, 
how do you go about doing this? You do not want to actually kick 
out disability rolls. People actually really cannot work. 
So there are things to do. But I think if we are going to be doing 
something, we need to really—not all policy would work, depending 
on why people have actually dropped out. And I do not think that 
all of the drop is actually real for concern. I mean, so—— 
Chairman Lee. Excellent. And you would not recommend an ex-
pansion of the Export-Import Bank as a means of increasing that? 
Dr. De Rugy. No. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you very much. I really appreciate each 
of you coming. This has been an interesting and informative hear-
ing and we are grateful to you being here. 
The record will remain open for two weeks. We stand adjourned. 
[Whereupon, at 3:57 p.m., Wednesday, November 20, 2019, the 
hearing in the above-entitled matter was adjourned.]

OPENINGSTATEMENTOFMIKELEE, CHAIRMAN, JOINTECONOMICCOMMITTEE 
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for this hearing of the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee. 
The American labor market is strong. The current economic expansion is the long-
est in U.S. history. Our unemployment rate has remained at or below 4 percent for 
the last 20 months and continues to fall. Average wage growth has slowed down a 
bit, but remains strongest for lower-paid workers. The gains have been broadly 
shared: African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates are at all-time lows. 
Female labor force participation is approaching an all-time high. And analysts spec-
ulate that we still have yet to reach ‘‘full employment.’’ 
Yet, behind these indicators of recent strength, there lies a worrisome, long-term 
trend—what Nicholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute has called an 
‘‘invisible crisis.’’ Many American men are leaving the workforce altogether. Though 
on the rise, the employment-to-population ratio for prime-age men—those between 
the ages of 25 and 54—is near levels not seen since the Great Depression. Even in 
today’s strong labor market, we see that once taut connections to the workplace 
have not only slackened, but frayed. 
The economic implications of such disconnection should be clear to all. But the 
Joint Economic Committee’s Social Capital Project, as part of its mission to under-
stand ‘‘associational life’’ in America today, has studied the plight of these discon-
nected men and identified potentially greater consequences for the health of our 
families and communities. In its report, ‘‘Inactive, Disconnected, and Ailing: A Por-
trait of Prime-Age Men Out of the Labor Force,’’ the Project found that disconnected 
men are more socially isolated and less happy than their employed peers. At the 
community level, the disappearance of work can lead to depopulation, brain drain, 
and the decline of other institutions of civil society. 
If we are to expand opportunity by strengthening families, communities, and civil 
society, we must devote our attention to work—a means of supporting ourselves and 
our families, a source of meaning and purpose, and a site for affirming and satis-
fying relationships. I hope that our discussions this afternoon give us a clearer sense 
of how to connect more Americans to this wellspring of opportunity and social cap-
ital. 
At this afternoon’s hearing, we will seek to better understand the forces shaping 
the labor market and Americans’ connections to it. A variety of reasons have been 
offered to explain why fewer Americans in their prime earning years are joining the 
workforce. Several interdependent themes emerge from most analyses: declining 
economic dynamism, falling worker mobility, stagnating wages, trade exposure, em-
ployment polarization, skill-biased technological change, and an expanding safety 
net. 
Our next step will be to consider policy reforms consonant with the most plausible 
explanations for declining prime-age labor force participation. What barriers to op-
portunity can we identify and try to remove? How might incentives to join the work-
force be strengthened? How might we more smartly invest in human and social cap-
ital to create new opportunities? Possible solutions may involve reforming the safety 
net, modernizing labor regulations, and increasing wage growth. 
The Social Capital Project will cover all of these topics in a forthcoming report, 
to be informed by the insights of today’s panelists. I look forward to their testi-
monies and to a productive conversation aimed at drawing disconnected Americans 
off the sidelines and into the workplace. 
I now recognize Senator Hassan for opening remarks.

PREPAREDSTATEMENTOFSENATORMAGGIEHASSAN 
Thank you Chairman Lee for focusing this committee’s attention on the important 
issue of getting more Americans to participate in our workforce. 
And thank you to our witnesses for being here today. 
Members of both parties agree that we must increase labor force participation. 
While low unemployment rates in my home State of New Hampshire and across 
the country are welcome news, we know that a low unemployment rate can also 
present real challenges—from businesses not being able to find workers, to addi-
tional pressure being put on the productivity of our current workforce. 
For a variety of reasons, too many Americans are falling out of the workforce. And 
a smaller percentage of Americans participating in the workforce can drag on eco-
nomic growth. 
It is critical that we address the root causes that result in people not seeking em-
ployment. And today’s hearing presents an opportunity to address those factors and 
look toward bipartisan solutions.

To start, as our economy changes rapidly, individuals may not have the skills and 
supports that they need to enter—and remain—in the workforce. And I have heard 
from businesses throughout New Hampshire that one of their top challenges is find-
ing more qualified workers, even at entry level jobs. 
Addressing this challenge requires us to both strengthen job training efforts and 
remove the barriers that prevent too many people from participating or remaining 
in the workforce. 
I have introduced bipartisan legislation—the Gateway to Careers Act—that would 
do just that. 
This bill would provide grants to support partnerships between community or 
technical colleges and workforce development partners such as State workforce de-
velopment boards, industry associations, and community-based organizations. 
These partnerships would help remove many of the barriers that prevent too 
many people from completing a 2-year degree or credential by connecting them to 
support services, including housing, mental health and substance use disorder treat-
ment, assistance in obtaining health insurance coverage, offering career counseling, 
transportation, and other services. 
By strengthening job training and support services we can connect more people 
with the tools that they need to enter and succeed in our changing economy. 
Another systemic barrier that many Americans face is a lack of access to paid 
leave and child care. 
Frequently, those who want to work are held back by pressing family responsibil-
ities that make it impossible. A recent report by the Hamilton Project showed that 
9.6 million women who are not participating in our workforce list family and home 
responsibilities as their primary reason. 
Mr. Chair, I request that the Hamilton Project Report: ‘‘Labor Force Nonparticipa-
tion: Trends, Causes, and Policy Solutions’’ be entered in the record. 
By enacting more family-friendly policies that enable people to balance their work 
and family responsibilities we can help more people join or rejoin the labor market. 
We also must break down employment barriers facing traditionally disadvantaged 
communities. 
In 2018, Brookings found that only four out of 10 working-age adults who experi-
ence disabilities are employed. So we also need to address the challenges that those 
who experience disabilities encounter in entering our workforce. 
As Governor, I signed legislation banning employers from paying workers with 
disabilities at a lower rate than the minimum wage, making New Hampshire the 
first State in the Nation to ban sub-minimum wages. We must make this a Federal 
priority—which is why I have cosponsored the Transformation to Competitive Em-
ployment Act, which would phase out the practice of paying a sub-minimum wage 
to workers with disabilities nationwide. 
We should also make sure that workers who experience disabilities receive the 
support they need to succeed in the workplace and are less likely to fall out of the 
labor market. 
Finally, no conversation about increasing participation in our workforce can ex-
clude addressing the costs of higher education. 
Right now, students face far too many obstacles in getting the education that they 
need—particularly when it comes to affordability. 
No one who is pursuing higher education so that they can build a better future 
for themselves—and in turn our economy—should have to put that goal on hold be-
cause they can’t afford it. And they should not have to take on substantial debt to 
do so either. 
I’ll continue working on strategies to increase college affordability and to lower 
the burden of student debt, so that more workers can get the education that they 
need to thrive. 
We can all agree that tackling our workforce challenges requires a multi-faceted 
and comprehensive approach. 
There’s not a single solution. And we have multiple opportunities to connect more 
people to work. 
I look forward to hearing more from our witnesses today. 
And now, I’ll turn it back over to Chairman Lee.

Policy Disincentives in Maintaining Labor Force Attachment 
Veronique De Rugy 
Senior Research Fellow, Mercatus Center at George Mason University 
Connecting More People to Work 
Joint Economic Committee 
November 20, 2019 
Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today. I am a 
senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason, where I study the US economy, 
the federal budget, and tax policy. 
Ensuring that American workers can stay attached to the labor market is an uncontroversial 
public policy objective. Yet government policies at the federal, state, and local levels today make 
it harder for some workers to tap into particular markets in which workers are paid higher wages 
and are most productive. As a result, some workers stay idle. The following are the main points 
of my testimony today: 
1.  The labor market and the state of American workers are better than commonly suggested. 
2.  A small but sizeable segment of working-age Americans have not shared in that progress 
as they have been permanently disconnected from the labor force. 
3.  Government policies, such as land use regulation, occupational licensing, and Social 
Security disability insurance (SSDI) are some of the government barriers that are 
changing incentives for some workers to work less or not at all. 
American Workers in a Dynamic Economy 
A common view across the political spectrum is that most American workers are falling behind 
or are barely getting by. Thankfully, in reality, the state of American workers is more positive. 1 
It is true that, according to conventional measurement, real wages have been stagnant over the 
past several decades. This measurement, however, deflates nominal wages using the Consumer 
Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPT-U). It overstates inflation and, hence, understates real 
gains in purchasing power. 2 Using the more accurate Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) 
deflater, the average real wage has grown by 24 percent from 1975 to 2015. According to the 
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, real worker compensation per hour, which combines wages 
and benefits, climbed by 51 percent between 1973 and 2018.3 
The same is true of real median household income. Measured properly, in 2018 the real median 
household income was significantly higher than it was in 1973. In addition, smaller household 
size means fewer potential earners and lower household expenses per member. After adjusting 
using the more accurate inflation deflater, and after normalizing household size, real median

household income has risen by 50 percent during the past 50 years, rather than by the 21 percent 
reported in US Census data.4 
Unemployment today is near a 50-year low, no matter how one measures it. The labor force 
participation rate (LPR) has been trending down over the past two decades, but it remains higher 
than it was in the 1950s, I 960s, and 1970s. Furthermore, the drop in the LPR among prime-age 
males began decades before 1990. What has changed significantly since 1990 is the slowdown in 
the rise of the LPR of working-age females. In addition, a large majority of men who dropped 
out of the labor force report exiting to pursue education, to retire, or be on disability. None of 
these reasons signal a dysfunctional economy. 
Meanwhile, over the past three decades, the private service sector has created over 41 million net 
new jobs, many of which are in high-paying service sectors such as business and professional 
services, financial activities, management, healthcare, and education. While millions of 
manufacturing and other ""middle skill"" jobs have been eliminated, that decline has been more 
than offset by the increase in high-skilled jobs. What's more, economist David Autor finds that 
""there is essentially no aggregate change in the share of workers employed in traditionally low 
skilledjobs over the course of 45 years,"" which led him to conclude, ""Thus, in aggregate, 
occupational polarization appears to be a case of the middle-class joining the upper-class, which 
is not something that economists should worry about.""5 
Adjustment and Attachment Issues 
Despite the current low unemployment rate and an economy that is widely considered to be at 
full employment, data show that a small but sizeable segment of working-age Americans, 
disproportionately working-age men, have dropped out of the labor force entirely. This 
phenomenon has rightfully received serious attention from scholars and policymakers. 
Some of the most commonly cited reason behind the decline are skills biased technological 
change, an increase in incarceration rates, rising levels of addiction to opioids, or trade 
competition.6 For instance, a widely discussed paper, ""The China Shock,"" Autor, David Dorn, 
and Gordon Hanson highlighted the fact that trade competition with China between 1999 and 
2011 could have displaced as many as 2.4 million lost jobs, with I million of those jobs in 
manufacturing. 7 The authors also show that the effect of the shock could be persistent, and that 
it produced far more disruption than benefits for some workers. 8 
However, contrary to the way the findings of""The China Shock"" have been presented not only 
in the press but even in the broader academic and policy worlds, ""The China Shock"" does not 
highlight an issue with trade competition per se. First, the paper ignores the large and 
documented benefits of increased trade with China over the past two decades. 9 It also does not 
account for offsetting job creation elsewhere in the US economy. Since then, many economic 
studies have found that the net aggregate effect on jobs of increased US trade with China is 
zero.10 
The ultimate conclusion from all these studies, however, isn't that the sudden increase of trade 
with China didn't cause any serious disruption in the US labor market or in local labor markets.

Because it did. The most important lesson is that American workers confronted with economic 
disruptions today face relatively new, more serious problems than they were facing before. In the 
past, economic shocks like the one caused by Chinese import competition were followed by a 
increase in the unemployment rate. But as people moved away to find jobs, or changed jobs, 
unemployment returned to a lower level.11 ""The China Shock"" exposed that, in this case, 
Americans, especially those who are not college educated, didn't move away and instead 
remained in hard-hit locales and stayed unemployed. 
The Role of Policy 
The reasons behind the phenomenon of a growing group of working-age Americans detached 
from the labor market are complex and not open to simple or easy policy responses. That said, 
before rushing to adopt new or expanded federal interventions in labor markets, policymakers 
should first look at government policies that cause or exacerbate the issue. These policies reduce 
interstate mobility, or they change incentives for workers on the margin to work less or not at all, 
and they are in desperate need of reform. Without changes, other federal attempts to address the 
challenge of disconnection from the labor force could be moot. 
Twill highlight a few of them here. 
Land Use 
A large body ofresearch by economists strongly suggests that land and zoning regulations have 
played a crucial role in exacerbating adjustment issues. These regulations increase the cost of 
housing in higher wage areas and make it harder to move there. 12 Standard estimates say that 
even modest housing deregulation would lead to a large increase in the supply of housing in the 
most prosperous areas of the country, which would soon be followed by economic migration to 
these areas. That would raise US GDP by between 2 percent and 9 percent, 13 reducing poverty 
and inequality in the process by giving lower-income workers greater access to higher-wage 
labor markets.14 
Land and zoning regulations also create an incentive for low-skilled workers to stay where 
housing is cheap, even though the job opportunities there are more limited. 15 
Occupational Licensing 
Studies also find that occupational licensing laws raise barriers between workers and better job 
markets. Under these rules, individuals often must pay high fees, undergo many days in training 
or experience, or earn arbitrary certifications before being allowed to work in a particular state or 
city. 
Today, one-third of US workers are required to comply with occupational licensing 
requirements, an increase from one-twentieth of US workers in the 1950s. 16 Unlike in the past, 
when the license requirements mostly targeted high-risk and often high-income professions such 
as surgeon and dentist, the poor now face a large number of these requirements too. They are 
arguably a more meaningful barrier for the poor than the rich. 17 Many of these occupations, such 
as hairdresser, transit driver, or skilled technician, traditionally provided low-income Americans 
with upward mobility and a ladder to self-sufficiency. 18 By effectively restricting access to some

37 
jobs, these requirements drive down employment in the licensed industries and make it more 
difficult for low-income Americans to reach the first rung of that economic ladder, making their 
climb out of poverty that much more difficult. 19 
Licensing requirements also operate as a barrier to interstate mobility, as they vary between 
states and, with rare exceptions, licenses can't be transferred. For workers in a licensed industry, 
moving from one state to another requires costly courses, tests, and training.20 Even when the 
tests are the same between states, states often require different scores to pass, making it difficult 
to transfer licenses.21 The cost ofrenewing one's license in a different state creates substantial 
barriers to entry for many classes of workers, hence limiting interstate mobility.22 
Occupational licensing also increases the prices of goods and services for consumers. In the case 
of services such as childcare, this effect is an impediment for working parents wishing to stay 
attached to the work force. 23 
Social Security Disability Insurance 
In recent years economists have been debating why inactivity in the labor force among prime-age 
men has grown so steadily for so long. The data suggest that the rising inactivity rates may not 
reflect a worsening of the job market (lower demand), but actually reflect patterns ofreduced job 
seeking (lower supply).24 
Research by Scott Winship finds that most prime-age men not in the labor force, or inactive, 
report that they are disabled.25 The portion of those reportedly disabled men has fluctuated 
between 56 percent and 65 percent since the early 1990s. Another third of inactive men are 
retired, enrolled in school or training, or taking care of a family member. Just 1 in 10 men not in 
the labor force fall outside of these categories. The same study finds that around one-quarter of 
prime-age inactive men say they want a job, while the remaining three-quarters do not. 
Similarly, a report by the Joint Economic Committee finds that almost half of inactive prime-age 
men are disabled, with poor physical health, poor mental health or both. 26 The report finds that 
25-35 percent of inactive men are retired, in school, or homemakers; and among able-bodied 
inactive men, only 12 percent say that they want a job when asked. What's more, those who have 
proactively looked for work in the past year make up 23 percent of inactive men, meaning that 
three-fourths of inactive prime-age men are not looking for work-many of them because they 
can't and some of them because they won't. Understanding whether inactive men would prefer 
to work or not is important to design policies to stop or reverse the rise in inactivity. 
Also, since the increase in the number of prime-age men reporting a disability accounts for 
roughly half the rise in total inactivity in recent decades, it is useful to look at the possible 
incentives created by disability programs. 
Legislation in 1984 created major reforms to the SSDI program. One of the most consequential 
changes was to liberalize screening and eligibility for mental health conditions. 27 Over the past 
30 years, a growing number of SSDI beneficiaries have qualified for the program not on the 
basis of having a specific identifiable qualifying condition, but on the basis of their 
employability given their physical or mental complaint, age, education, and work experience.28

This has led many scholars to conclude that these changes in SSDI eligibility have increased the 
number of men claiming disability.29 
This increase took place even though health improved and most jobs are less physically exerting 
and dangerous than in the past, with more service jobs and fewer jobs in manufacturing, 
agriculture, and mining.30 Thanks to medical advances, occupational injury rates have declined, 
and worker impairments are less severe.31 All these factors should have reduced the ranks of 
prime-age men claiming disability. 
Winship concludes his study by observing, ""The rise in labor force inactivity is primarily a 
supply-side issue, a reflection of changed incentives for workers on the margin to work less or 
not at all. But a cause for concern ought to be the rising receipt of disability benefits at a time 
when a variety of trends point to improved health and greater access to employment among the 
disabled."" 
Other Programs 
In addition to the limits on access to better job markets, government policies reduce workers' 
willingness to exit depressed economic regions in the first place. These policies keep people in 
stagnant labor markets, limiting output and increasing inequality.32 Such programs include 
federal incentives ofhomeownership.33 Some studies also find that homeownership rates 
correlate with substantially higher unemployment and result in substantially lower labor 
mobility. 34 
Other programs slow the adjustment process. For instance, the Trade Adjustment Assistance 
program, intended to subsidize US workers affected by import competition, creates disincentives 
to return to work. 35 Other federal job training programs create similarly negative incentives to 
return to work. In addition, increases in the real value of state minimum wages can contribute to 
a decline in aggregate employment rates; as do increases in the share of individuals with prison 
records.36 
Conclusion 
Before policymakers rush to implement new federal government programs to address worker 
attachment issues, they should acknowledge that some of the challenge in connecting some 
workers to the workforce are created by existing government programs. These barriers should be 
eliminated. 
These reforms would lead to more opportunities and better lives for those who have been frozen 
out of the gains enjoyed by most workers. Unfortunately, in some cases, it isn't clear what the 
federal government can do to help move these reforms along as the issues are caused by state and 
local government rules. Finally, while these reforms may not be the whole answer to the 
challenge of connecting more workers to the workforce, a failure to make these changes will 
make other reform efforts by the federal government less effective or even ineffective.

Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Maloney, and Members of the Committee, thank you for 
inviting me to participate in today's hearing.1 
""Connecting more people to work"" is a critically important topic-perhaps even the 
most important one for American policymakers at this moment. Properly diagnosing 
the challenge and developing effective responses must begin, however, with a 
discussion of why the topic matters. 
If the issue were merely of material living standards or poverty reduction, no crisis 
would exist. Thanks to government benefit programs, household consumption has been 
rising at every point on the socioeconomic spectrum2 and a vanishingly low share of the 
population remains unable to meet basic needs. 3 Where progress is slow or need unmet, 
more and larger government transfers might well be an easier remedy than finding 
ways to connect more people to better work. 
Nor is the issue merely one of economic growth, with any aggregate increase in output 
equally worthwhile. Many of those struggling to find and maintain steady work are 
among the least productive participants in the labor market; boosting the hours worked 
or productivity of those already thriving, or accelerating the rate of immigration, might 
lift GDP further, faster. 
Rather, we are concerned about work because connection to the labor force, the ability to 
support a household, and the opportunity to contribute productively to a community 
are fundamental to the flourishing of American citizens, the strength of their families, 
and the long-term trajectory of our economy. 
I.  What Work ls Worth 
Without work-the quintessential productive activity-self-esteem declines and a sense 
of helplessness increases.4 People become depressed-unemployed Americans are twice 
as likely as full-time workers to receive treatment for depression; the long-term

unemployed are three times as likely.5 In empirical ""happiness"" studies, life satisfaction 
drops ten times more from unemployment than from a substantial loss of income.6 And 
while people return to their previously self-reported levels of happiness several years 
after marrying, divorcing, becoming widowed, or welcoming a first child into the 
world, they never get used to joblessness.7 
Contrary to the typical commencement address, however, what makes work 
meaningful doesn't depend on its inspirational nature or on it having a transformative 
effect on the world. Work is meaningful because of what it means to the person 
performing it, what it allows him to provide to his family, and what role it establishes 
for him in his community. In The Dream and the Nightmare, Myron Magnet drives home 
this distinction at the expense of Felix Rohatyn, a prominent New York liberal who 
lamented the ""dead-end lives"" of"" the man and his wife slogging away in menial jobs 
that are dead-end jobs, with three kids, trying to deal with an environment that is very 
depressing.""8 
If the man is a short-order cook and his wife cleans hotel rooms, observed Magnet in the 
early 1990s, their income would support a ""threadbare but adequate"" lifestyle. (Though 
note that, based on New York City's median wages for his hypothetical couple's 
occupations, their income in 2016 would have been 15 to 20 percent lower than when he 
wrote.9) He continued: 
But you do not judge people's lives only from the material point of view. 
Suppose that these two have brought up their children to respect the 
parents' hard work, to be curious about the world, to study in school, to take 
pleasure in family and community life, to consider themselves worthwhile 
people, to work hard and think about the future, to become skilled tradesmen 
or even professional as adults, and to bring grandchildren to visit. If this is

a dead end rather than a human accomplishment worthy of honor and 
admiration, then it is hard to know what human life is about. 
A job may appear to be a ""dead end"" on a company's organizational chart, but that's 
not how it looks to a family. That doesn't describe its value to the community members 
who benefit from the product or service. Nor does it even begin to capture the role that 
the job plays in the worker's life. 
For the individual, work imposes structure on each day and on life in general. It offers 
the mundane but essential disciplines of timeliness and reliability and hygiene as well 
as the more complex socialization of collaboration and paying attention to others. It 
requires people to interact and forges shared experiences and bonds. It promotes goal 
setting and long-term planning. True, other pursuits can provide these kinds of 
benefits-for example, raising children, keeping a home, or volunteering in the 
community. But sleeping, couch surfing, or playing video games does not. And for out 
of-work men in particular, such idle activities tend to fill up their time.10 
Work (again, especially for men) helps establish and preserve families. Where fewer 
men work, fewer marriages form.11 Unemployment doubles the risk of divorce, and 
male joblessness appears the primary culprit.12 These outcomes likely result from the 
damage to both economic prospects and individual well-being associated with being 
out of work, which strain existing marriages and make men less attractive as marriage 
partners. The so-called marriageable-men hypothesis associated with sociologist 
William Julius Wilson, which suggests that a lack of job opportunities contributed to the 
collapse of two-parent families in the African American community, remains 
controversial.13 But that debate is largely about whether lack of economic opportunity 
was the underlying cause of male idleness. Few would question that such idleness 
would tend to reduce the likelihood and the stability of marriage.

Current economic conditions do appear to play a role in harming marriage formation. 
MIT professor David Autor and his colleagues found that U.S. regions facing greater 
competition from China experience lower rates of marriage and higher shares of 
children born to single mothers and that this effect appeared only when the economic 
disruption affected male employment.14 Johns Hopkins professor Andrew Cherlin and 
his colleagues sought to study the ""relationship between economic inequality and 
sociodemographic outcomes such as family formation,"" for which they noted a lack of 
""satisfactory evidence on the mechanisms by which inequality may have an effect.""15 
When they accounted for a region's availability of ""middle-skilled jobs,"" accessible to 
high school graduates and paying above-poverty wages, they found that the labor 
market, not the inequality, was influencing family formation. The issue was less who 
earns how much more than whom and more who has a chance to earn a living at all. 
Work is both a nexus of community and a prerequisite for it. Work relationships 
represent a crucial source of social capital, establishing a base from which people can 
engage in the broader community-whether it's playing on a softball team, organizing 
a fund-raising drive, or hosting a field trip for the local preschool. This dimension of 
employment is especially relevant outside of urban centers; in such settings, the 
workplace can become a central meeting point. Communities that lack work, by 
contrast, suffer maladies that degrade social capital and lead to persistent poverty. 
Crime and addiction increase, their participants in turn becoming ever less 
employable;16 investments in housing and communal assets decline; a downward spiral 
is set in motion. 
The role of family and community in transmitting opportunity to the next generation 
also depends on work. When parents lose their jobs, their children tend to do worse in 
school, graduate at lower rates, and have less success as adults.17 Recall that, while 
productive activity provides direct benefits to workers, its worth also derives from the 
dignity and respect that society confers on self-reliance and productive contributions. In 
a community where dependency is widespread, illegality a viable career path, and 
idleness an acceptable lifestyle, the full-time worker begins to look less admirable-and 
more like a chump.

II.  What Happened to Work? 
By now, the problem of declining labor-force participation is well known. Here I'll 
emphasize just one statistic. A critical reference point for understanding the nation's 
economic condition is the employment-to-population ratio-that is, what share of 
adults has a job and what share does not. Of particular concern is the share of prime-age 
men (25-54 years old) not working full-time. In September 2019, at what appears to be 
the peak of an economic boom, that figure was above 18%.18 This represents substantial 
improvement over the Great Recession's aftermath, when the figure reached as high as 
27%. But it is higher than the average for the 2001-07 economic expansion19 and well 
above that expansion's strongest period, when fewer than 16 % of prime-age men lacked 
full-time work. In the strongest period of the 1991-2001 expansion, the figure was below 
14%; during 1982-90, it dipped even lower. 
Far from booming, in a pre-2007 frame of reference the 2019 economy looks like one in 
the throes of a recession. The current 18% of prime-age men lacking full-time work is 
larger than the share at any time during the recessions of 1990-91 and 2001. Over the 
full period from when the Bureau of Labor Statistics data begin in 1986 to the start of 
the Great Recession in 2007, fewer than one in every 10 months experienced as bleak a 
picture. If the share of prime-age men working full-time in 2000 had persisted to the 
present, 2.3 million additional men would be working. 
This long-term decline in work for men appears unique to the American economy, 
rather than reflective of shifting demographics or a global mega trend. The analysis 
considers only prime-age workers, so the general aging of the population plays no role. 
Nor has a skew toward older men within the prime-age demographic led to lower 
labor-force participation.20 Perhaps most strikingly, the American experience is not 
materializing in other developed economies. During 1990-2018, the U.S. experienced 
the third-largest decline among OECD countries in its prime-age male labor-force 
participation rate (behind only Italy and Denmark) and now ranks 33rd out of 36 
countries.21 The U.S. decline of 4.4 percentage points over the period was roughly

These figures are not seasonally adjusted because BLS does not provide adjusted data on full-time employment for specific 
demographic groups. 
19 Business-cycle definitions are taken from ""'U.S. Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions,"" Business Cycle Dating 
Committee, National Bureau of Economic Research. It defines the most recent recessions as extending from July 1990 to March 
1991, March 2001 to November 2001, and December2007 to June 2009.

double that of its peers: the United Kingdom (2.8 percentage points), France (2.7), 
Canada (2.3), Japan (1.9), Germany (1.9), and Sweden (0.9). 
Certainly, a wide variety of factors influence the long-term slide in labor-force 
participation for American men. For instance, changes in cultural norms and home 
environments may both be discouraging men from working and reducing their 
capacity. The labor market, meanwhile, has failed to generate attractive opportunities 
that prospective workers are capable of seizing. 
Attempts to allocate responsibility among these factors have set off two robust, but 
ultimately irrelevant debates. First, have wages technically risen or fallen? Men's 
median weekly earnings have fallen by 7% since 1979, if adjusted for inflation using the 
Consumer Price Index relied upon by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,22 but an 
alternative measure of inflation produced by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 
suggests instead that earnings have increased over the period by 12%.23 Still, even using 
the more optimistic estimate, the gains hold only for men with college degrees; all other 
groups saw declines. 
Whether wages are slightly lower or higher in real terms is beside the point. No one 
believes that a 5% wage decline over 40 years would produce a labor market exodus 
while a 5% wage increase would flood the market with new workers. Regardless, the 
important fact would remain that men's median earnings have fallen woefully behind 
the trajectory of growth in the wider economy and the rising costs associated with 
achieving a middle-class lifestyle. Technically, then, concern over the trend in wages is 
focused on their relative value. 
But, of course, the relative value of a wage is always what matters. This becomes 
obvious upon recognizing that the point at which wages began stagnating in the 1970s 
is actually an arbitrary one to use in the analysis. It may seem coherent to ask why, if 
people were happy with a 1970 wage in 1970, they cannot be happy with that wage in 
2019. But it seems coherent only because we take for granted that people can and do 
live on 1970s wages today. If absolute wages are what matter, why look to 1970? We 
could just as well look back to 1910 and ask whether we think it would work to have 
men today earning 1910 wages, which were fine in 1910. 
A tempting response might be that the problem is not the 1910 wage per se but rather 
the decline from the 1970 to 1910 level. But that is precisely the point. Taking the 
""absolute"" view seriously, declines cannot be important either. What is a decline, after 
all, but a shift from one absolute level to a different absolute level, both of which proved

perfectly adequate at various times in the past. A concern for ""decline"" is already a 
concession that the relative trajectory, not any absolute level, is what matters. If that's 
the case, then stagnation -while better than decline -can still trigger all manner of ills. 
The second robust but irrelevant debate centers on attempts to allocate responsibility 
across the myriad factors that may be influencing men's behavior. Maybe stagnant 
wages are a problem, but isn't the ""cultural problem"" even larger? And if that's the 
case, aren't policymakers helpless? No. 
Regardless of how weight is assigned amongst the various factors, the question for 
policymakers is how to improve the situation. Huge, immovable cultural and economic 
burdens may push toward harmful decisions. But so too, a number of such factors push 
more constructively: behaving responsibly, planning for the future, holding a job, 
sacrificing for a family-people are aware that these things really do have benefits. In 
the past, in a world not unrecognizably different from the present, with many critical 
conditions resting in similar repose, men were more likely to work. Whatever marginal 
shifts changed outcomes for the worse, some-even different ones -can cause just as 
much change for the better. 
Thus, the observation that many major factors are cultural, and policymakers cannot 
affect them, has no bearing on the importance of identifying those factors, economic or 
cultural, that might help tip the scales and where public policy exerts a powerful 
influence. This is most obviously the case when it comes to the labor market-if more 
and better jobs were more accessible to more people, they would be more likely to 
work. Better public policy can help. 
III.  Strengthening the Labor Market 
The path to strengthening the labor market can start with the observation of Harvard 
professor Edward Glaeser: ""Every underemployed American represents a failure of 
entrepreneurial imagination. ... Joblessness is not foreordained, because entrepreneurs 
can always dream up new ways of making labor productive.""24 Yet saying that 
entrepreneurs can always dream up new ways of making labor productive does not 
mean that they will. Only so many entrepreneurs put their time-and investors their 
capital-into so many businesses each year. If their most attractive opportunities 
involve the deployment of American workers, they will pursue that course. If investing 
in continual improvement of each American worker's productivity is critical to their 
success, they will do that too. But if other workers are more profitable to employ than 
Americans are, or if business models that rely less on labor present them with lower 
risks and higher rewards, then those entrepreneurs - and the economy - will respond 
accordingly.

The answer is not to blame the labor market for acting like a market. A market is a tool 
that translates underlying conditions into the most efficient outcome. Even when 
conditions bring a bad outcome, the market mechanism itself remains hugely valuable. 
It preserves liberty and fosters choice for individuals, creates incentives via competition 
for innovation and investment, and helps resources flow toward the most productive 
uses. To observe an inadequate result at the macro level, that is, is not to imply that we 
know the correct result at the micro level-who should work for whom or at what 
wage-and trying to outperform a free market in answering such questions would be 
foolhardy. Instead, public policy should focus on those underlying conditions: why is 
the market settling where it does, and under what circumstances would it settle 
somewhere better? 
The labor market's conditions dictate its behavior along five dimensions-and it can be 
improved along all five, depending on the trade-offs that society chooses to make. Here, 
I provide a brief overview of each. 
Demand 
What work does the economy need done? Consumer preferences and industry 
economics dictate much of the answer, but, at the margin, the rules that government 
puts in place can alter the balance. For instance, heavily regulating industrial activity 
and imposing stringent environmental regulation on physical infrastructure, while 
leaving the digital economy mostly free from regulation, will tend to constrict the 
demand for manufacturing workers, while expanding it for software engineers. 
Targeting taxes at energy-intensive activities, while aggressively subsidizing health care 
and higher education, will have profound effects on which industries stall and which 
thrive. 
Over time, these kinds of choices can begin to affect consumer preferences and industry 
economics. Innovation will start to shift to those areas where entrepreneurs anticipate 
building the most successful businesses-whether that's in manufactured goods or 
high-end services, housing renovations or artistic performances. And where greater 
investment accumulates, the efficiencies of scale and expertise and supply chains 
develop too. A country consistently seen as the second-best location for a new factory 
will watch as factories get built in other places, and the researchers and suppliers and 
distributors follow-and soon it won't even be the fifth best location. 
Supply 
What work are people prepared to do? The employer bears significant responsibility for 
training workers to meet its needs and improving their productivity over time. But for 
this investment to make sense, the worker must demonstrate basic capabilities at the

outset. The better prepared the prospective workforce, the faster an employer can bring 
workers on board and the higher their wages will be. 
The students to whom the education system tailors its efforts will experience the 
greatest boost in their work prospects. This emphasis will also influence demand, as 
entrepreneurs build businesses where they expect to find well-prepared workers. If 
public schools offer a wide range of programs and lavish attention on those connected 
to the weakest segments of the labor market, they can push outcomes in a positive 
direction. If they adopt an attitude of ""college or bust,"" we shouldn't be surprised to 
find a workforce consisting primarily of college graduates and busts. 
Boundaries 
Who gets to perform work and who gets to purchase it? When trade and immigration 
policies expand the pool of employers and consumers demanding various types of 
work, the workers able to provide it will likely see more opportunities-and higher 
wages. But when policies dramatically expand the supply of workers able to meet 
existing demand, domestic workers will suffer. In establishing a labor market's 
boundaries, balance is therefore crucial. 
Unfortunately, in a wealthy country like the United States, balance will rarely be 
achieved for less-skilled workers if residents of poorer countries can participate without 
limit in the same labor market. Entrepreneurs gain access to a vastly larger and cheaper 
supply of labor, while imperatives vanish to build businesses that use the existing 
domestic labor supply or make investments in improving domestic workers' 
capabilities. This effect swamps the smaller uptick in demand for less-skilled American 
labor that those workers might expect to see from the poorer countries' consumers. 
Transactions 
How do workers and employers establish and manage their relationships? The set of 
negotiable terms and conditions and the rules of negotiation have a significant influence 
on the nature of transactions in any market. This is triply true in the labor market, 
where overlapping regimes of contract law, employment law, and labor law govern the 
efforts of workers and employers to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Any contract 
they wish to sign must grapple with the myriad rules that government imposes about 
hours, wages, conditions, benefits, and much more. On top of those rules, the presence 
of a union may introduce an additional layer of collective bargaining, itself controlled 
by government rules. 
In principle, allowing workers to bargain collectively should give them an opportunity 
to secure better terms than they might each achieve individually. Furthermore, by 
placing workers and employers on equal footing, concerns of unequal power and unfair

51 
agreements fall by the wayside, reducing the need for government dictates. Why does 
the Department of Labor need to set the standard for overtime pay when the parties can 
be reasonably expected to work out this issue for themselves? But done poorly, a 
system of organized labor can have the opposite effect, creating industry-wide cartels 
that negotiate agreements in the long-term interest of no one. 
Taxes 
How do the employer's total cost and the worker's take-home pay differ from the 
agreed-upon wage? The term tax is meant here in the broadest sense. Obviously, the 
direct taxes imposed on both employers and workers represent a large wedge inserted 
between the bargain that the parties might like to strike and the costs and benefits that 
they ultimately experience. But many other factors play a similar role, adding to the cost 
of becoming a worker or hiring one. 
Conversely, government can offer subsidies that offset tax burdens or even raise the 
transaction's value to one or both parties beyond what the market offers. If society 
wants more from the labor market, it must consider paying for it. This can take forms 
ranging from tax credits for the employer or worker to direct subsidies that boost wages 
to better infrastructure that lowers transportation costs. 
*** 
On each of these dimensions, America's choices have been misguided. We overtax and 
underinvest in less-skilled workers, make them costly and risky to employers, and 
discourage investment in the industries where they could work most productively. At 
the same time, we free employers from the constraints of using the existing domestic 
workforce, offering them instead an option of using much cheaper foreign workers 
overseas or bringing the cheaper workers here. The immediate effects of these policy 
choices have often appeared beneficial, even to the workers who now find themselves 
disadvantaged. But those policies have, over time, reshaped the economy's contours in 
ways that have left too many people out.

on the subject of 
""Connecting More People to Work"" 
November 20, 2019 
Mr. Chairman, Madame Vice Chair, Members of the Joint Economic Committee, thank you for inviting 
me to discuss this important topic today. Getting more people into the labor market and into jobs is a 
central part of generating broadly shared growth and raising living standards. 
The United States--which used to be a world leader in labor force participation for both men and 
women-now substantially lags many other advanced economies. 
Although the overall U.S. labor force participation rate has been stable since approximately 2015, it had 
been on a downward trend beginning in the year 2000. Much, but not all, of that decline is attributable to 
the aging of the population as more adults are retirement age. Looking across age groups: younger adults 
are participating less than in the last century, largely because more of them are in school;' adults over 55 
are participating at higher rates than in the late 1990s;2 participation for those aged 25-54 has been 
rebounding since 2015, but is still below its 1999 peak.3 There is room in the labor market for 
participation to rise. 
Economists often focus on those of'·prime"" working age, between 25 and 54, as they are usually neither 
in school nor retired in large numbers. Prime-age men have seen a persistent downward trend in 
participation over the last half century, largely due to declining rates among men with less education. 
Research has shown that this group has seen a decline in demand for their labor, and prime-age men with 
less than a high school education actually make $3.40 less an hour (adjusted for inflation) than they did in 
1980.4 
Reducing gaps in labor force participation 
In my work with The Hamilton Project, we have argued that a great deal can be learned about how to lift 
participation from looking at the gaps across groups and the specific barriers some face. For example, 
while prime-age men with a bachelor's degree or more participate at a rate of94 percent, those with a

high school degree only participate at 86 percent, and those with less than a high school education 
participate at just 80 percent.5 For those with less education, taking steps to increase training and 
education along with other steps to lift wages could improve their labor market outcomes and directly lift 
participation.6 
Low-wage U.S. labor markets are unstable, and the data show that low-wage workers are more likely to 
have irregular schedules and to cycle in and out of the labor force. Relying on a one-month snapshot can 
overestimate how many are truly out of the labor force as opposed to struggling to stay in it. In fact, of 
those out of the labor force in a given month who are not disabled, students, retirees, or caregivers, at 
least 76 percent are actually in the labor force at some point in the next 16 months.7 Improving worker 
pay, schedules, bargaining power, and worker rights in these jobs to make them more stable could help.8 
Women represent the largest pool of untapped labor in today's labor market. U.S. women used to lead the 
world in participation rates; today they are in the middle of the pack of advanced economies. Of the 22 
million prime-age individuals out of the labor force, almost I I million list ""taking care offamily 
member"" as the reason they are not in the labor force-and 90 percent of those individuals are women.9 
While some are home by choice, 35 percent of women who say they want a job but are not working list 
family responsibilities as the barrier. 10 Evidence shows that better availability of childcare (and 
eldercare)--in particular for lower income households-would allow more who want to work to be in the 
labor force and that well-designed parental leave policies could keep more women attached to the labor 
force after having children.11 
There are also massive gaps in labor force participation across places. In top-ranked counties, 88 percent 
of prime-age adults are in the labor force compared to 70 percent in bottom-ranked counties."" This gap 
dwarfs the drop in overall participation from 1999 to 2014. Place-based policies that try to spur labor 
demand in struggling regions could lift national participation. They are also important in their own right 
as a way to provide better economic opportunity and outcomes to a wider swath of Americans. 13

There are also huge barriers to labor force participation of the formerly incarcerated. Removing those 
barriers and reducing the punitiveness of the criminal justice system is imperative.14 African American 
men have lower rates of participation, likely due in part to disproportionate incarceration rates as well as 
what studies show to be considerable discrimination in labor markets. 15 Combatting these barriers is 
important. 
Finally, the second largest group out of the labor force--after caregivers-are those listing health or 
disability as a barrier. This includes physical health, mental health, and addiction. We need better 
healthcare and treatment to keep people in the labor market. 
It is important to note that it is poor health, not the safety net, that is a major barrier to work. Not all of 
those listing health or disability as a reason for being out of the labor force receive disability payments, 16 
and reported health measures for this group show sharply worse health relative to the overall population.17 
Furthermore, there is no evidence that increasing work requirements in SNAP or introducing them in 
Medicaid lifts labor force participation meaningfully. Reforms to the disability system making it easier 
for those with health limitations to work could help;18 however, this would still not address the combined 
barriers this population faces of chronic health challenges coupled with low market wages. 
Creating jobs is also crucial. A strong economy can raise wages, force employers to cast a wider net to 
find workers, and draw people into the labor market. Conversely, economic downturns damage labor 
force participation and should be minimized by making more use of automatic fiscal stabilizers. 19

discrimination, see Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) and Goldin and Rouse @QQ) among many others. 
16 Of those prime-age individuals citing poor health as the reason they did not work in the prior year, 64 percent 
actually receive disability income based on author's calculations using data from the 2018 Current Population 
Survey Annual Social and Economic SupplellJent. Disability income includes income from Disability Insurance; 
workers compensation; veterans benefits; disability related income from Social Security or Supplemental Security 
Income; and disability benefits from a company, union, state or local government, U.S. railroad retirement, or 
private accident or disability insurance. This is an underestimate due to the known problem of the CPS 
undercounting receipt of disability income. Joint Economic Committee Republican Staff (2018) states that 75 
percent of those listing disability as a reason for nonparticipation received SSDI or SSI based on a different data set. 
17 See Joint Economic Committee Republican Staff (2018) who report lower overall reported mental and physical 
health for this group, Bauer and Shambaugh (2018) who show that SNAP recipients who are labor force 
nonparticipants due to health are highly likely to have disabilities and take daily prescription medication, and Coile 
and Duggan (2019) who show worsening health status for prime-age men from 2000 to today-especially for those 
with less education-consistent with rising numbers of individuals out of the labor force due to health. 
Schanzenbach et al. (2016) shows deteriorating health for 25-49 year-olds and sharply lower health for those with 
low incomes.

Americans are trying to work, but they often face major barriers. Ninety-four percent of prime-age adults 
out of the labor force are either disabled, taking care of relatives, students, or retired. 20 It is removing

Testimony of Jose Ortiz, Jr. 
Executive Director, NYC Employment and Training Coalition 
As delivered to the Joint Economic Committee 
Hearing on ""Connecting More People to Work"" 
November 20, 2019 
Good afternoon and thank you Chairman Lee, Chairwoman Maloney and members of the Joint Economic 
Committee for holding this hearing and for the invitation to speak before you today. I'll be speaking to the 
need to more effectively address labor force participation gaps amongst marginalized populations, 
especially those without college degrees, due to bmTiers to workforce development, training and 
employment. 
My name is Jose Ortiz, Jr. and I am the Executive Director of the New York City Employment and 
Training Coalition. NYCETC supports the workforce development community to ensure that every New 
Yorker has access to the skills, training and education needed to thrive in the local economy, and that 
every business is able to maintain a highly skilled workforce. Our 160 member organizations provide job 
training and employment services annually to more than 500,000 underserved New Yorkers. Everyday, 
the workforce development system demonstrates that, given the appropriate tools to address specific 
individual and systemic challenges, people are resilient and capable of learning at any stage of their lives. 
The country is experiencing unprecedented economic growth, and while we know that talent exists 
everywhere --in towns and cities large and small --a significant percentage of people across the nation 
lack relevant work experience and professional skill that would make them viable candidates for 
employment across industries. Research shows us that while 53 percent of all jobs in today's labor market 
are middle skill, only 43 percent of U.S. workers are trained at this level, which means that industries 
cannot grow to their full potential and American workers face highly limited pathways into careers with 
good wages.' 
In addition to the moral imperative, there is an economic imperative to increasing investments in 
workforce development. Sixty-two percent of small and mid-sized business leaders reported that it is 
difficult to find skilled workers. 2 Seventy-nine percent of these business leaders also expressed their 
support for new, public investments in workforce policies.' Additionally, 64% of business leaders say 
increased government funding for support services to help people finish skills training programs will help 
their business.' 
To maximize national economic growth, meet employers' talent needs, and eliminate the widening wage 
gap, we must do better at helping Americans gain the competencies and credentials required for 
in-demand careers. Roughly 75 million people who are unemployed, underemployed, or not working but 
not counted in unemployment figures:'

•  6.5 million unemployed (including 1.3 million long-term unemployed 6 
•  I .6 million not working but not counted in unemployment figures ' 
•  ~ 68 million earning less than $ 15 per hour 8 
Included in these numbers are: 
•  Adults without a postsecondary credential 
•  Adults living in pove1iy 
•  Individuals with some college but no credential 
•  Young people ages 16-24 not in school or working 
Effective workforce programs contain the following critical components that, when combined and 
structured to be reactive to each individual's needs, provide people with the deep intervention and 
intensive services required to ensure successful entry and growth in a career: 
•  Employers inform workforce development providers and educational institutions on the skills 
needed for jobs 
o  Build in-demand skills rooted in labor market data 
o  Employer and community partnerships (ex. curriculum development, internship 
opportunities, funding) 
o  Access to internship or on-the-job learning 
o  Industry-recognized credentials: industry certifications, occupational licenses, and 
apprenticeship certificates 
•  Intensive and immersive programs engage paiticipants and provide them with skills development 
in areas required for each profession 
o  Trainings are specialized, integrating technical, behavioral and mindset skills 
o  Professional development, communication skills, time management, resume prep and 
support with online job tools, interview skills, teamwork and leadership training, and 
strategies to address imposter syndrome 
•  Instruction is provided in a variety of ways including in conventional classroom experiences, 
online, and video including new tools like mobile 
•  Regular assessments to identify and address problems so that students can display a mastery of 
skills 
•  Wraparound services: transportation, childcare, mental health supports, and other services 
•  Retention and advancement services 
The efficacy of these programs is backed up by the on-the-ground experience of our members working 
hand in hand with local employers to taylor programs to their needs and those of individuals, our 
discussions with employers large and small, and long standing research. These programs also have 
unquestionable results. Recent data suggests that taxpayers reap as much as $4 for every$ I spent on 
workforce programs.9 
6 The ""long-term unemployed"" are indIv1duals who have been unemployed for 27 or more weeks. 
7 The U.S. Bureau of Labor StatIstIcs does not count these people as unemployed because they had not searched 
for work in the four weeks preceding the survey. However, they are indIv1duals who are not in the labor force, who 
wanted and were available for work, and who had looked for a job sometime in the pnor 12 months.

Per Scholas, which provides tuition-free technology training to adults across the country for careers as IT 
professionals, and the hundreds of people it trains is a clear example of the impact of workforce programs. 
Per Scholas' track record includes a 400% increase in graduates' post-training income and an 80% 
placement rate into quality and stable careers in the growing tech field. Deris ofCinncinati is a 38-year 
old man that exemplifies the tenacity and potential that exists in all of our communities. Having to drop 
out of college due to family obligations, Deris spent years in ""tech adjacent"" jobs with limited career 
growth. As valedictorian of his 14 week IT Suppo1i course10 equipped with CompTIA A+ and Network+ 
certifications, he found a job as a contractor with TEKSystems, a Per Scholas Signature Partner insurance 
group, working on an Internet Security team. His new confidence, in-demand skills and network of tech 
employers has enabled him to provide much more stability and health to his children, and even prompted 
him to start a business around work with high school students and computer troubleshooting skills called 
Youth Tech Cafe. 
Additionally, labor market data points to the fact that the needs nf industry and their respective businesses 
are changing more rapidly than ever before. Technological shifts require that workers are trained to meet 
the needs of not only today, but also tomorrow. These changes are not only affecting those individuals 
from lower socioeconomic backgrounds with less educational attainment, this is also affecting individuals 
who have some college experience or a degree like Deris, making it more difficult to gain access to and 
compete for jobs in today's labor market. 
In New York, there is a direct correlation with higher unemployment rates amongst individuals who 
identify as Black, Latinx, and female,11 making programs like Per Scholas -whose students are 87 percent 
people of color and 30 percent women -and STRIVE critical to closing this talent gap.12 
DeAsia, a young black woman who found herself on her own at the age of 16 bouncing from state to state 
looking for work opportunities, is a prime example of the specific barriers to employment that many black 
women face and the spectacular impacts that a job training program equipped with soft skills training and 
wraparound support has been proven to have. She had been through personal trauma, was struggling to 
earn a living, suffered from depression. When she became pregnant with her son Jeramiah she found 
herself living in a domestic violence shelter, seeking a career to ensure a better life for them both. At 
STRIVE -a 35 year old organization whose programs facilitate the personal and professional growth 
needed for people who face the biggest obstacles to employment to find and retain employment in several 
states across the US -DeAsia got the training she needed to thrive and found the support system she'd 
been missing. Her participation in the 12 week Career Pathways program, which included attitudinal 
training, professional skills, work readiness and sector-based occupational skills training in Health & 
Office Operations led to her earning a Medical Billing and Coding certification and opened doors to a 
multitude ofj obs with opportunity for career advancement at STRIVE's healthcare employer partners. 
She was first hired at Northwell Health in New York City in an entry-level position with a starting salary 
of$l3 per hour, and has since advanced to earn a double Master's in Healthcare Administration and 
Business Management and is an Insurance Authorization Specialist at Northwell with a middle-class 
salary of over $52,000 per year.

However, we know that this is a problem that is not isolated to these populations, and is also affecting 
non-college educated whites across the nation, and especially individuals with additional challenges to 
employment such as criminal justice histories or substance abuse issues. To tackle these challenges, 
organizations like Seedco, a national nonprofit dedicated to advancing economic opportunity for people, 
businesses, and communities in need, have targeted programs that combine in-demand skill development 
with behavioral and interpersonal development. 
Jared, a 24 year old white man born and raised in rural Arkansas and an early criminal history, sought out 
Seedco in Memphis, Tennessee seeking to transform his life and travel down a positive pathway through 
work. Participating in the ""Turning Point Young Adult Re-Entry Program"" enabled him to think critically 
about how own choices, explore viable career pathways, and led him to the Kingdom Low-Voltage 
Apprenticeship Program. Jared is currently earning $11.50/per hour with Torry Low-Voltage 
Communications, LLC while training to become a certified Telecommunications Technician. This is 
significantly higher than the Tennessee minimum wage of$7.25/hour. Telecommunications is a field that 
continues to provide extensive career opportunities as the Mid-South region is experiencing significant 
expansion in the construction industry via hotels, business expansions, and additional projects over the 
next 10 years. Due to this growth, there will be a need for trained installers of cabling like Jared in the 
buildings as they are erected. Being employed has also allowed Jared to overcome additional barriers. He 
was able to pay multiple outstanding fines in Arkansas, complete the Alcohol and Drug Safety Education 
Program and secure a room in a group housing facility. 
Employment training programs like Seedco are not only critical to connecting more people to work, but 
are also pivotal to our nation's ability to remain competitive in the face of automation and the radical 
impact it will have on all facets of our economy. Over the next 10 years, more than I 0% of all 
occupations can be fully automated. 13 Automation will affect occupations that include bus drivers and 
nurse assistants, stock clerks and travel agents, dental lab technicians, sewing machine operators and 
assembly-line workers.14 The same study found that 40% of all work activities have the potential to be 
automated using current demonstrated technologies. 15 The largest occupational categories in the US 
economy are also the ones with the greatest potential for automation-related displacement -office 
support; construction; mining; agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; retail trade; accommodation and 
food services; and manufacturing.16 This will affect individuals and economies across all states that we 
represent, in cities and towns that we all call home and love. 
Across the U.S.17 
•  Workers with a high school diploma or less are four times more likely to lose their jobs; 
•  11.9 million Blacks and Latinx are projected to be displaced; and 
•  14.7 million young workers between the ages of 18 and 34, as well as 11.5 millions workers who 
are 50 years of age or older will lose their jobs 
Couple these challenges with the likelihood of another economic downturn in the foreseeable future, 
significant labor market challenges will continue to persist for both workers and employers.

The good news is that job growth will be net positive over the next l O years. Specifically, jobs are 
projected to grow in occupations including solar installers, wind turbine technicians, health professions 
(health aides, technicians, occupational therapy assistants, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and 
wellness), personal care aides, information security analysts, statisticians, speech language pathologists. 18 
Jobs that are projected to grow in occupations and/or be transformed include including health professions, 
STEM, creatives and arts, business and legal professions, management, education and workforce training, 
and customer service and sales. 19 
And as these jobs are created and/or are transformed, workers must develop new in-demand skills to meet 
employer needs. Therefore, these complex challenges require complex interventions and investments, and 
the collective action of all stakeholders across the system, to ensure more workers have career pathways 
into these new roles and businesses have viable talent. As the stories of Deris, DeAsia, Jared and the 
organizations that trained and snpported them along the way show -we can equip people with the 21st 
century skills needed to change the impact of automation from ""elimination"" to '·transformation"" by 
focusing investments and policies in the following ways: 
•  Government agencies can partner with educational institutions, providers, and intermediaries at 
earliest stages of economic development and re-zoning initiatives to ensure local workers are 
trained for and have access to employment opportunities; 
•  Workforce Investment Boards can help direct investments for programs that train people for 
in-demand roles in the local economy; 
•  NGOs and Foundations can fund and assist in the designing of innovative solutions for hard to 
solve problems; 
•  Companies can internally design programs for retraining incumbent workers; and work with 
external partners to develop target programs to develop new talent pipelines; 
•  Educational institutions and job training providers can form partnerships to train incumbent 
workers and develop new pipelines that provide access for new talent. Describe clear ROI for 
investors and employers; and 
•  Indus1:Jy and Labor Organizations can support workers in identifying training for, and 
transitioning to, in-demand roles 
There are many more examples of individuals that, with their hard work and dedication, have overcome 
their personal and institutional barriers to employment. However, each of these success stories includes a 
deep investment capital and other resources in order to ensure that each worker not only finds, but also 
retains employment for many years to come. In many instances, individuals may still require certain 
public benefits as they regain their footing. In the long-term, these significant investments will lead to 
individuals and families that are more likely to be self-sufficient. 
This task is enormous. However, the federal government must ensure that workforce development 
programs like the ones highlighted and the hundreds that are not, are funded. All Americans, especially 
those in the untapped workforce, need increased access and supportive services to succeed in job training 
programs and industry-recognized credentials, and corresponding careers. Once successful, we will raise 
the standards of living for all who reside in our towns and cities across America. 
Thank you.

Men  and  women  of  color  suffer  disproportionately  during  economic 
downturns. The unemployment rate for African Americans now stands at 
5.4 percent—nearly two percentage points higher than the overall rate of 
3.6 percent. 
• What can Congress do now to help minimize the expected rise in the 
unemployment rate for people of color during the next recession— 
whenever it may hit? 
Thank you for this question. You are exactly correct that men and women of color 
suffer  disproportionately  during  recessions.  In  general  any  group  that  is 
marginalized in the labor market tends to do worse in recessions. In the Great Re-
cession, unemployment rates doubled for nearly every group. Since the African- 
American unemployment rate was higher to begin with, a doubling meant a much 
larger increase. 
In addition, it is important to consider another labor market challenge dispropor-
tionately impacting African-American workers: the dramatic racial disparities in the 
rates of underemployment (including those who are part-time but would rather work 
full-time and those who are marginally attached to the labor force). At all points 
of the business cycle, white workers have lower underemployment rates than Afri-
can-American (or Hispanic) workers. 
For example, in 2018 the underemployment rate for white workers was approxi-
mately 6 percent in 2018, compared to a rate of approximately 12 percent for Afri-
can Americans. 
When we look at underemployment rate disparities during the Great Recession 
an even more grim picture can be painted. In April 2011, underemployment among 
African-American workers reached 24.9 percent, over one year after the African- 
American unemployment rate peaked at 16.8 (in March 2010). This stands in sharp 
contrast with the peak white underemployment rate in the wake of the Great Reces-
sion, which was only slightly higher than the pre-recession low for African-American 
underemployment. 
There are two main ways one could minimize the damage done to men and 
women of color during recessions. The first is to minimize the damages of recessions 
overall. Better use of automatic fiscal stabilizers could try to limit the impact of a 
downturn on the labor market. For example, one could strengthen the safety net 
and make it more responsive to downturns (including: waive work requirements 
faster in a downturn in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program SNAP, for-
merly the Food Stamp Program], increase unemployment insurance and SNAP pay-
ments during a recession, reintroduce some countercyclicality to Temporary Assist-
ance for Needy Families [TANF]). One could also use triggers based on the increase 
in the unemployment rate to increase infrastructure spending automatically, in-
crease Federal support to states for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance 
Program (CHIP), and mail direct checks to individuals. The Hamilton Project re-
cently put out a book (along with the Washington Center for Equitable Growth) 
called ‘‘Recession Ready’’ that discusses many of these ideas. These policies would 
not directly target the labor market experience of men and women of color, but 
given that men and women of color are more exposed to recessions, by limiting a 
recession’s impact, these policies would help. 
Another set of options is to try to make these groups less marginalized in the 
labor market overall. For example, robust enforcement of anti-discrimination poli-
cies would help. In addition, though, because of a range of barriers men and women 
of color face in labor markets and in general, they often face other disadvantages 
in the labor market. Men of color are more likely to have been incarcerated, and 
criminal records are a hindrance in the labor market. Both reducing unnecessary 
incarceration and unequal application of law enforcement along with policies to cre-
ate pathways for the formerly incarcerated to rejoin the labor market would both 
help. Similarly, individuals with less education tend to have worse labor market 
outcomes. Policies to improve educational outcomes for young men and women of 
color along with policies that create better pathways to employment for those with-
out a college degree could both help the labor market outcomes of men and women 
of color. 
Finally, one could try to take specific actions that safeguard men and women of 
color in the labor market in a downturn. For example, making sure that cities do 
not substantially cut back employment opportunities due to budget problems and 
making sure that poor rural areas—which often have large populations of men and 
women of color—also feel the impact of fiscal stimulus is important. Policies like the

emergency TANF support that was included in the American Recovery and Rein-
vestment Act helped stimulate employment in poorer communities. Making that an 
ongoing program that could scale up during recessions and making sure that it is 
applied in a way that benefits communities of color would be an important step. 
The negative labor market experience of vulnerable populations during recessions 
is one of the main motivations for robust countercyclical macroeconomic policy. 
Along with policies that try to reduce discrimination and help communities of color 
more broadly, strong countercyclical policy could help minimize these damages.

To help both our workers and our businesses that struggle to find work-
ers with the necessary technical skills, we need a strong training and edu-
cation agenda. I have introduced legislation to improve apprenticeship and 
workforce training programs and to expand the ‘‘529’’ tax advantaged edu-
cation savings program to include training and credential programs that 
help workers develop the skills needed for 21st century jobs. 
• In your view, what measures should we take to ensure workers are pre-
pared to transition to jobs for which employers are hiring? 
QUESTIONFORTHERECORDFORJOSEORTIZ, JR., SUBMITTEDBYSENATORHASSAN 
Mr. Ortiz, as Governor of New Hampshire, and in the U.S. Senate, I have 
tried to identify workforce training strategies that would help pull individ-
uals into the labor marker who were chronically unemployed or under-
employed. 
Too often, these individuals are not able to get the training they need for 
existing job openings because they face barriers like access to transpor-
tation and child care. 
To help address this, I introduced the bipartisan Gateway to Careers Act 
to strengthen career pathway opportunities and help individuals navigate 
barriers that keep too many people from participating or staying in the 
workforce like transportation and child care. 
What more do you think we should be doing to help families access the 
services they may already be eligible for and strengthen career training 
programs to be responsive to issues individuals face outside of the work-
place? 
Can you describe programs and strategies that have worked for partici-
pants in your programs?

Policy Disincentives in Maintaining Labor Force Attachment 
 
Veronique De Rugy 
Senior Research Fellow, Mercatus Center at George Mason University 
 
Connecting More People to Work 
Joint Economic Committee 
 
November 20, 2019 
 
 
Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today. I am a 
senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason, where I study the US economy, 
the federal budget, and tax policy. 
 
Polices that ensure American workers can stay attached to the labor market are worth pursuing. 
Unfortunately, government policies at the federal, state, and local levels today make it harder for 
some workers to tap into particular markets in which workers are paid higher wages and are most 
productive. As a result, some workers stay idle. The following are the main points of my 
testimony today: 
 
1.  The labor market and the state of American workers are better than commonly suggested. 
2.  A small but sizeable segment of working-age Americans have not shared in that progress 
as they have been permanently disconnected from the labor force. 
3.  Government policies, such as land use regulation, occupational licensing, and Social 
Security disability insurance (SSDI) are some of the government barriers that are 
changing incentives for some workers to work less or not at all. 
 
American Workers in a Dynamic Economy 
A common view across the political spectrum is that most American workers are falling behind 
or are barely getting by. Thankfully, in reality, the state of American workers is more positive.1 
 
It is true that, according to conventional measurement, real wages have been stagnant over the 
past several decades. This measurement, however, deflates nominal wages using the Consumer 
Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). It overstates inflation and, hence, understates real 
gains in purchasing power.2 Using the more accurate Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) 
deflator, the average real wage has grown by 24 percent from 1975 to 2015. According to the 
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, real worker compensation per hour, which combines wages 
and benefits, climbed by 51 percent between 1973 and 2018.3 
 
The same is true of real median household income. Measured properly, in 2018 the real median 
household income was significantly higher than it was in 1973. In addition, smaller household 
size means fewer potential earners and lower household expenses per member. After adjusting 
using the more accurate inflation deflator, and after normalizing household size, real median 
household income has risen by 50 percent during the past 50 years, rather than by the 21 percent 
reported in US Census data.4 
 
Unemployment today is near a 50-year low, no matter how one measures it. The labor force 
participation rate (LPR) has been trending down over the past two decades, but it remains higher 
than it was in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Furthermore, the drop in the LPR among prime-age 
males began decades before 1990. What has changed significantly since 1990 is the slowdown in 
the rise of the LPR of working-age females. In addition, a large majority of men who dropped 
out of the labor force report exiting to pursue education, to retire, or be on disability. None of 
these reasons signal a dysfunctional economy. 
 
Meanwhile, over the past three decades, the private service sector has created over 41 million net 
new jobs, many of which are in high-paying service sectors such as business and professional 
services, financial activities, management, healthcare, and education. While millions of 
manufacturing and other “middle skill” jobs have been eliminated, that decline has been more 
than offset by the increase in high-skilled jobs. What’s more, economist David Autor finds that 
“there is essentially no aggregate change in the share of workers employed in traditionally low-
skilled jobs over the course of 45 years,” which led him to conclude, “Thus, in aggregate, 
occupational polarization appears to be a case of the middle-class joining the upper-class, which 
is not something that economists should worry about.”5 
 
Adjustment and Attachment Issues 
Despite the current low unemployment rate and an economy that is widely considered to be at 
full employment, data show that a small but sizeable segment of working-age Americans, 
disproportionately working-age men, have dropped out of the labor force entirely. This 
phenomenon has rightfully received serious attention from scholars and policymakers.  
 
Some of the most commonly cited reason behind the decline are skills biased technological 
change, an increase in incarceration rates, rising levels of addiction to opioids, or trade 
competition.6 For instance, a widely discussed paper, “The China Shock,” Autor, David Dorn, 
and Gordon Hanson  highlighted the fact that trade competition with China between 1999 and 
2011 could have displaced as many as 2.4 million lost jobs, with 1 million of those jobs in 
manufacturing.7  The authors also show that the effect of the shock could be persistent, and that 
it produced far more disruption than benefits for some workers.8  
 
However, contrary to the way the findings of “The China Shock” have been presented not only 
in the press but even in the broader academic and policy worlds, “The China Shock” does not 
highlight an issue with trade competition per se. First, the paper ignores the large and 
documented benefits of increased trade with China over the past two decades.9 It also does not 
account for offsetting job creation elsewhere in the US economy. Since then, many economic 
studies have found that the net aggregate effect on jobs of increased US trade with China is 
zero.10 
 
The ultimate conclusion from all these studies, however, isn’t that the sudden increase of trade 
with China didn’t cause any serious disruption in the US labor market or in local labor markets. 
Because it did. The most important lesson is that American workers confronted with economic 
disruptions today face relatively new, more serious problems than they were facing before. In the 
past, economic shocks like the one caused by Chinese import competition were followed by a 
increase in the unemployment rate. But as people moved away to find jobs, or changed jobs, 
unemployment returned to a lower level.11 “The China Shock” exposed that, in this case, 
Americans, especially those who are not college educated, didn’t move away and instead 
remained in hard-hit locales and stayed unemployed. 
 
The Role of Government Policies 
The reasons behind the phenomenon of a growing group of working-age Americans detached 
from the labor market are complex and not open to simple or easy policy responses. That said, 
before rushing to adopt new or expanded federal interventions in labor markets, policymakers 
should first look at government policies that cause or exacerbate the issue. These policies reduce 
interstate mobility, or they change incentives for workers on the margin to work less or not at all, 
and they are in desperate need of reform. Without changes, other federal attempts to address the 
challenge of disconnection from the labor force could be moot. 
 
I will highlight a few of them here. 
 
Land Use 
A large body of research by economists strongly suggests that land and zoning regulations have 
played a crucial role in exacerbating adjustment issues. These regulations increase the cost of 
housing in higher wage areas and make it harder to move there.12 Standard estimates say that 
even modest housing deregulation would lead to a large increase in the supply of housing in the 
most prosperous areas of the country, which would soon be followed by economic migration to 
these areas. That would raise US GDP by between 2 percent and 9 percent,13 reducing poverty 
and inequality in the process by giving lower-income workers greater access to higher-wage 
labor markets.14 
 
Land and zoning regulations also create an incentive for low-skilled workers to stay where 
housing is cheap, even though the job opportunities there are more limited.15 
 
Occupational Licensing 
Studies also find that occupational licensing laws raise barriers between workers and better job 
markets. Under these rules, individuals often must pay high fees, undergo many days in training 
or experience, or earn arbitrary certifications before being allowed to work in a particular state or 
city. 
 
Today, one-third of US workers are required to comply with occupational licensing 
requirements, an increase from one-twentieth of US workers in the 1950s.16 Unlike in the past, 
when the license requirements mostly targeted high-risk and often high-income professions such 
as surgeon and dentist, the poor now face a large number of these requirements too. They are 
arguably a more meaningful barrier for the poor than the rich.17 Many of these occupations, such 
as hairdresser, transit driver, or skilled technician, traditionally provided low-income Americans 
with upward mobility and a ladder to self-sufficiency.18 By effectively restricting access to some 
jobs, these requirements drive down employment in the licensed industries and make it more 
difficult for low-income Americans to reach the first rung of that economic ladder, making their 
climb out of poverty that much more difficult.19  
 
Licensing requirements also operate as a barrier to interstate mobility, as they vary between 
states and, with rare exceptions, licenses can’t be transferred. For workers in a licensed industry, 
moving from one state to another requires costly courses, tests, and training.20 Even when the 
tests are the same between states, states often require different scores to pass, making it difficult 
to transfer licenses.21 The cost of renewing one’s license in a different state creates substantial 
barriers to entry for many classes of workers, hence limiting interstate mobility.22  
 
Occupational licensing also increases the prices of goods and services for consumers. In the case 
of services such as childcare, this effect is an impediment for working parents wishing to stay 
attached to the work force.23 
 
Social Security Disability Insurance 
In recent years economists have been debating why inactivity in the labor force among prime-age 
men has grown so steadily for so long. The data suggest that the rising inactivity rates may not 
reflect a worsening of the job market (lower demand), but actually reflect patterns of reduced job 
seeking (lower supply).24 
 
Research by Scott Winship finds that most prime-age men not in the labor force, or inactive, 
report that they are disabled.25 The portion of those reportedly disabled men has fluctuated 
between 56 percent and 65 percent since the early 1990s. Another third of inactive men are 
retired, enrolled in school or training, or taking care of a family member. Just 1 in 10 men not in 
the labor force fall outside of these categories. The same study finds that around one-quarter of 
prime-age inactive men say they want a job, while the remaining three-quarters do not. 
 
Similarly, a report by the Joint Economic Committee finds that almost half of inactive prime-age 
men are disabled, with poor physical health, poor mental health or both. 26  The report finds that 
25–35 percent of inactive men are retired, in school, or homemakers; and among able-bodied 
inactive men, only 12 percent say that they want a job when asked. What’s more, those who have 
proactively looked for work in the past year make up 23 percent of inactive men, meaning that 
three-fourths of inactive prime-age men are not looking for work—many of them because they 
can’t and some of them because they won’t. Understanding whether inactive men would prefer 
to work or not is important to design policies to stop or reverse the rise in inactivity. 
 
Also, since the increase in the number of prime-age men reporting a disability accounts for 
roughly half the rise in total inactivity in recent decades, it is useful to look at the possible 
incentives created by disability programs. 
 
Legislation in 1984 created major reforms to the SSDI program. One of the most consequential 
changes was to liberalize screening and eligibility for mental health conditions.27 Over the past 
30 years, a growing number of SSDI beneficiaries have qualified for the program not on the 
basis of having a specific identifiable qualifying condition, but on the basis of their 
employability given their physical or mental complaint, age, education, and work experience.28 
This has led many scholars to conclude that these changes in SSDI eligibility have increased the 
number of men claiming disability.29 
 
This increase took place even though health improved and most jobs are less physically exerting 
and dangerous than in the past, with more service jobs and fewer jobs in manufacturing, 
agriculture, and mining.30 Thanks to medical advances, occupational injury rates have declined, 
and worker impairments are less severe.31 All these factors should have reduced the ranks of 
prime-age men claiming disability. 
 
Winship concludes his study by observing, “The rise in labor force inactivity is primarily a 
supply-side issue, a reflection of changed incentives for workers on the margin to work less or 
not at all. But a cause for concern ought to be the rising receipt of disability benefits at a time 
when a variety of trends point to improved health and greater access to employment among the 
disabled.”  
 
Other Programs 
In addition to the limits on access to better job markets, government policies reduce workers’ 
willingness to exit depressed economic regions in the first place. These policies keep people in 
stagnant labor markets, limiting output and increasing inequality.32 Such programs include 
federal incentives of homeownership.33 Some studies also find that homeownership rates 
correlate with substantially higher unemployment and result in substantially lower labor 
mobility.34 
 
Other programs slow the adjustment process. For instance, the Trade Adjustment Assistance 
program, intended to subsidize US workers affected by import competition, creates disincentives 
to return to work.35 Other federal job training programs create similarly negative incentives to 
return to work. In addition, increases in the real value of state minimum wages can contribute to 
a decline in aggregate employment rates; as do increases in the share of individuals with prison 
records.36 
 
Conclusion 
Before policymakers rush to implement new federal government programs to address worker 
attachment issues, they should acknowledge that some of the challenge in connecting some 
workers to the workforce are created by existing government programs. These barriers should be 
eliminated. 
 
These reforms would lead to more opportunities and better lives for those who have been frozen 
out of the gains enjoyed by most workers. Unfortunately, in some cases, it isn’t clear what the 
federal government can do to help move these reforms along as the issues are caused by state and 
local government rules. Finally, while these reforms may not be the whole answer to the 
challenge of connecting more workers to the workforce, a failure to make these changes will 
make other reform efforts by the federal government less effective or even ineffective.

Before the  
    Joint Economic Committee 
United States Congress 
 
November 20, 2019 
   
Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Maloney, and Members of the Committee, thank you for 
inviting me to participate in today’s hearing.1 
 
“Connecting more people to work” is a critically important topic—perhaps even the 
most important one for American policymakers at this moment. Properly diagnosing 
the challenge and developing effective responses must begin, however, with a 
discussion of why the topic matters. 
 
If the issue were merely of material living standards or poverty reduction, no crisis 
would exist. Thanks to government benefit programs, household consumption has been 
rising at every point on the socioeconomic spectrum2 and a vanishingly low share of the 
population remains unable to meet basic needs.3 Where progress is slow or need unmet, 
more and larger government transfers might well be an easier remedy than finding 
ways to connect more people to better work. 
 
Nor is the issue merely one of economic growth, with any aggregate increase in output 
equally worthwhile. Many of those struggling to find and maintain steady work are 
among the least productive participants in the labor market; boosting the hours worked 
or productivity of those already thriving, or accelerating the rate of immigration, might 
lift GDP further, faster.  
 
Rather, we are concerned about work because connection to the labor force, the ability to 
support a household, and the opportunity to contribute productively to a community 
are fundamental to the flourishing of American citizens, the strength of their families, 
and the long-term trajectory of our economy.  
 
I.  What Work Is Worth 
 
Without work—the quintessential productive activity—self-esteem declines and a sense 
of helplessness increases.4 People become depressed—unemployed Americans are twice 
as likely as full-time workers to receive treatment for depression; the long-term

unemployed are three times as likely.5 In empirical “happiness” studies, life satisfaction 
drops ten times more from unemployment than from a substantial loss of income.6 And 
while people return to their previously self-reported levels of happiness several years 
after marrying, divorcing, becoming widowed, or welcoming a first child into the 
world, they never get used to joblessness.7 
 
Contrary to the typical commencement address, however, what makes work 
meaningful doesn’t depend on its inspirational nature or on it having a transformative 
effect on the world. Work is meaningful because of what it means to the person 
performing it, what it allows him to provide to his family, and what role it establishes 
for him in his community. In The Dream and the Nightmare, Myron Magnet drives home 
this distinction at the expense of Felix Rohatyn, a prominent New York liberal who 
lamented the “dead-end lives” of “the man and his wife slogging away in menial jobs 
that are dead-end jobs, with three kids, trying to deal with an environment that is very 
depressing.”8  
 
If the man is a short-order cook and his wife cleans hotel rooms, observed Magnet in the 
early 1990s, their income would support a “threadbare but adequate” lifestyle. (Though 
note that, based on New York City’s median wages for his hypothetical couple’s 
occupations, their income in 2016 would have been 15 to 20 percent lower than when he 
wrote.9) He continued: 
 
But you do not judge people’s lives only from the material point of view. 
Suppose  that these two have brought up their children to respect the 
parents’ hard work, to be curious about the world, to study in school, to take 
pleasure in family and community life, to consider themselves worthwhile 
people, to work hard and think about the future, to become skilled tradesmen 
or even professional as adults, and to bring grandchildren to visit. If this is

median wages in the New York metropolitan area for a short-order cook and a housekeeping cleaner were $9.58 and $15.30 per 
hour, respectively, equivalent to $50,000 in annual income from two full-time jobs. “May 2016 Metropolitan and

a dead end rather than a human accomplishment worthy of honor and 
admiration, then it is hard to know what human life is about. 
 
A job may appear to be a “dead end” on a company’s organizational chart, but that’s 
not how it looks to a family. That doesn’t describe its value to the community members 
who benefit from the product or service. Nor does it even begin to capture the role that 
the job plays in the worker’s life. 
 
For the individual, work imposes structure on each day and on life in general. It offers 
the mundane but essential disciplines of timeliness and reliability and hygiene as well 
as the more complex socialization of collaboration and paying attention to others. It 
requires people to interact and forges shared experiences and bonds. It promotes goal 
setting and long-term planning. True, other pursuits can provide these kinds of 
benefits—for example, raising children, keeping a home, or volunteering in the 
community. But sleeping, couch surfing, or playing video games does not. And for out-
of-work men in particular, such idle activities tend to fill up their time.10 
 
Work (again, especially for men) helps establish and preserve families. Where fewer 
men work, fewer marriages form.11 Unemployment doubles the risk of divorce, and 
male joblessness appears the primary culprit.12 These outcomes likely result from the 
damage to both economic prospects and individual well-being associated with being 
out of work, which strain existing marriages and make men less attractive as marriage 
partners. The so-called marriageable-men hypothesis associated with sociologist 
William Julius Wilson, which suggests that a lack of job opportunities contributed to the 
collapse of two-parent families in the African American community, remains 
controversial.13 But that debate is largely about whether lack of economic opportunity 
was the underlying cause of male idleness. Few would question that such idleness 
would tend to reduce the likelihood and the stability of marriage.

Current economic conditions do appear to play a role in harming marriage formation. 
MIT professor David Autor and his colleagues found that U.S. regions facing greater 
competition from China experience lower rates of marriage and higher shares of 
children born to single mothers and that this effect appeared only when the economic 
disruption affected male employment.14 Johns Hopkins professor Andrew Cherlin and 
his colleagues sought to study the “relationship between economic inequality and 
sociodemographic outcomes such as family formation,” for which they noted a lack of 
“satisfactory evidence on the mechanisms by which inequality may have an effect.”15 
When they accounted for a region’s availability of “middle-skilled jobs,” accessible to 
high school graduates and paying above-poverty wages, they found that the labor 
market, not the inequality, was influencing family formation. The issue was less who 
earns how much more than whom and more who has a chance to earn a living at all. 
 
Work is both a nexus of community and a prerequisite for it. Work relationships 
represent a crucial source of social capital, establishing a base from which people can 
engage in the broader community—whether it’s playing on a softball team, organizing 
a fund-raising drive, or hosting a field trip for the local preschool. This dimension of 
employment is especially relevant outside of urban centers; in such settings, the 
workplace can become a central meeting point. Communities that lack work, by 
contrast, suffer maladies that degrade social capital and lead to persistent poverty. 
Crime and addiction increase, their participants in turn becoming ever less 
employable;16 investments in housing and communal assets decline; a downward spiral 
is set in motion. 
 
The role of family and community in transmitting opportunity to the next generation 
also depends on work. When parents lose their jobs, their children tend to do worse in 
school, graduate at lower rates, and have less success as adults.17 Recall that, while 
productive activity provides direct benefits to workers, its worth also derives from the 
dignity and respect that society confers on self-reliance and productive contributions. In 
a community where dependency is widespread, illegality a viable career path, and 
idleness an acceptable lifestyle, the full-time worker begins to look less admirable—and 
more like a chump.

II.  What Happened to Work? 
 
By now, the problem of declining labor-force participation is well known. Here I’ll 
emphasize just one statistic. A critical reference point for understanding the nation’s 
economic condition is the employment-to-population ratio—that is, what share of 
adults has a job and what share does not. Of particular concern is the share of prime-age 
men (25–54 years old) not working full-time. In September 2019, at what appears to be 
the peak of an economic boom, that figure was above 18%.18 This represents substantial 
improvement over the Great Recession’s aftermath, when the figure reached as high as 
27%. But it is higher than the average for the 2001–07 economic expansion19 and well 
above that expansion’s strongest period, when fewer than 16% of prime-age men lacked 
full-time work. In the strongest period of the 1991–2001 expansion, the figure was below 
14%; during 1982–90, it dipped even lower. 
 
Far from booming, in a pre-2007 frame of reference the 2019 economy looks like one in 
the throes of a recession. The current 18% of prime-age men lacking full-time work is 
larger than the share at any time during the recessions of 1990–91 and 2001. Over the 
full period from when the Bureau of Labor Statistics data begin in 1986 to the start of 
the Great Recession in 2007, fewer than one in every 10 months experienced as bleak a 
picture. If the share of prime-age men working full-time in 2000 had persisted to the 
present, 2.3 million additional men would be working. 
 
This long-term decline in work for men appears unique to the American economy, 
rather than reflective of shifting demographics or a global megatrend. The analysis 
considers only prime-age workers, so the general aging of the population plays no role. 
Nor has a skew toward older men within the prime-age demographic led to lower 
labor-force participation.20 Perhaps most strikingly, the American experience is not 
materializing in other developed economies. During 1990–2018, the U.S. experienced 
the third-largest decline among OECD countries in its prime-age male labor-force 
participation rate (behind only Italy and Denmark) and now ranks 33rd out of 36 
countries.21 The U.S. decline of 4.4 percentage points over the period was roughly 
 
18 BLS, “(Unadj) Population Level—25–54 Yrs., Men”; BLS, “(Unadj) Employed, Usually Work Full Time, 25–54 Yrs., Men.” 
These figures are not seasonally adjusted because BLS does not provide adjusted data on full-time employment for specific 
demographic groups. 
19 Business-cycle definitions are taken from “U.S. Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions,” Business Cycle Dating 
Committee, National Bureau of Economic Research. It defines the most recent recessions as extending from July 1990 to March 
1991, March 2001 to November 2001, and December 2007 to June 2009.

double that of its peers: the United Kingdom (2.8 percentage points), France (2.7), 
Canada (2.3), Japan (1.9), Germany (1.9), and Sweden (0.9). 
 
Certainly, a wide variety of factors influence the long-term slide in labor-force 
participation for American men. For instance, changes in cultural norms and home 
environments may both be discouraging men from working and reducing their 
capacity. The labor market, meanwhile, has failed to generate attractive opportunities 
that prospective workers are capable of seizing.  
 
Attempts to allocate responsibility among these factors have set off two robust, but 
ultimately irrelevant debates. First, have wages technically risen or fallen? Men’s 
median weekly earnings have fallen by 7% since 1979, if adjusted for inflation using the 
Consumer Price Index relied upon by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,22 but an 
alternative measure of inflation produced by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 
suggests instead that earnings have increased over the period by 12%.23 Still, even using 
the more optimistic estimate, the gains hold only for men with college degrees; all other 
groups saw declines.  
 
Whether wages are slightly lower or higher in real terms is beside the point. No one 
believes that a 5% wage decline over 40 years would produce a labor market exodus 
while a 5% wage increase would flood the market with new workers. Regardless, the 
important fact would remain that men’s median earnings have fallen woefully behind 
the trajectory of growth in the wider economy and the rising costs associated with 
achieving a middle-class lifestyle. Technically, then, concern over the trend in wages is 
focused on their relative value.  
 
But, of course, the relative value of a wage is always what matters. This becomes 
obvious upon recognizing that the point at which wages began stagnating in the 1970s 
is actually an arbitrary one to use in the analysis. It may seem coherent to ask why, if 
people were happy with a 1970 wage in 1970, they cannot be happy with that wage in 
2019. But it seems coherent only because we take for granted that people can and do 
live on 1970s wages today. If absolute wages are what matter, why look to 1970? We 
could just as well look back to 1910 and ask whether we think it would work to have 
men today earning 1910 wages, which were fine in 1910. 
 
A tempting response might be that the problem is not the 1910 wage per se but rather 
the decline from the 1970 to 1910 level. But that is precisely the point. Taking the 
“absolute” view seriously, declines cannot be important either. What is a decline, after 
all, but a shift from one absolute level to a different absolute level, both of which proved 
 
22 BLS, “Quartiles and selected deciles of usual weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers by selected characteristics, 
not seasonally adjusted”; BLS, “CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).” 
23 Bureau of Economic Analysis, “Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index.” 
7 
 
perfectly adequate at various times in the past. A concern for “decline” is already a 
concession that the relative trajectory, not any absolute level, is what matters. If that’s 
the case, then stagnation—while better than decline—can still trigger all manner of ills. 
 
The second robust but irrelevant debate centers on attempts to allocate responsibility 
across the myriad factors that may be influencing men’s behavior. Maybe stagnant 
wages are a problem, but isn’t the “cultural problem” even larger? And if that’s the 
case, aren’t policymakers helpless? No. 
 
Regardless of how weight is assigned amongst the various factors, the question for 
policymakers is how to improve the situation. Huge, immovable cultural and economic 
burdens may push toward harmful decisions. But so too, a number of such factors push 
more constructively: behaving responsibly, planning for the future, holding a job, 
sacrificing for a family—people are aware that these things really do have benefits. In 
the past, in a world not unrecognizably different from the present, with many critical 
conditions resting in similar repose, men were more likely to work. Whatever marginal 
shifts changed outcomes for the worse, some—even different ones—can cause just as 
much change for the better.  
 
Thus, the observation that many major factors are cultural, and policymakers cannot 
affect them, has no bearing on the importance of identifying those factors, economic or 
cultural, that might help tip the scales and where public policy exerts a powerful 
influence. This is most obviously the case when it comes to the labor market—if more 
and better jobs were more accessible to more people, they would be more likely to 
work. Better public policy can help. 
 
III.  Strengthening the Labor Market 
 
The path to strengthening the labor market can start with the observation of Harvard 
professor Edward Glaeser: “Every underemployed American represents a failure of 
entrepreneurial imagination. . . . Joblessness is not foreordained, because entrepreneurs 
can always dream up new ways of making labor productive.”24 Yet saying that 
entrepreneurs can always dream up new ways of making labor productive does not 
mean that they will. Only so many entrepreneurs put their time—and investors their 
capital—into so many businesses each year. If their most attractive opportunities 
involve the deployment of American workers, they will pursue that course. If investing 
in continual improvement of each American worker’s productivity is critical to their 
success, they will do that too. But if other workers are more profitable to employ than 
Americans are, or if business models that rely less on labor present them with lower 
risks and higher rewards, then those entrepreneurs—and the economy—will respond 
accordingly. 
 
24 Glaeser, “The War on Work.” 
8 
 
 
The answer is not to blame the labor market for acting like a market. A market is a tool 
that translates underlying conditions into the most efficient outcome. Even when 
conditions bring a bad outcome, the market mechanism itself remains hugely valuable. 
It preserves liberty and fosters choice for individuals, creates incentives via competition 
for innovation and investment, and helps resources flow toward the most productive 
uses. To observe an inadequate result at the macro level, that is, is not to imply that we 
know the correct result at the micro level—who should work for whom or at what 
wage—and trying to outperform a free market in answering such questions would be 
foolhardy. Instead, public policy should focus on those underlying conditions: why is 
the market settling where it does, and under what circumstances would it settle 
somewhere better? 
 
The labor market’s conditions dictate its behavior along five dimensions—and it can be 
improved along all five, depending on the trade-offs that society chooses to make. Here, 
I provide a brief overview of each. 
 
Demand 
 
What work does the economy need done? Consumer preferences and industry 
economics dictate much of the answer, but, at the margin, the rules that government 
puts in place can alter the balance. For instance, heavily regulating industrial activity 
and imposing stringent environmental regulation on physical infrastructure, while 
leaving the digital economy mostly free from regulation, will tend to constrict the 
demand for manufacturing workers, while expanding it for software engineers. 
Targeting taxes at energy-intensive activities, while aggressively subsidizing health care 
and higher education, will have profound effects on which industries stall and which 
thrive. 
 
Over time, these kinds of choices can begin to affect consumer preferences and industry 
economics. Innovation will start to shift to those areas where entrepreneurs anticipate 
building the most successful businesses—whether that’s in manufactured goods or 
high-end services, housing renovations or artistic performances. And where greater 
investment accumulates, the efficiencies of scale and expertise and supply chains 
develop too. A country consistently seen as the second-best location for a new factory 
will watch as factories get built in other places, and the researchers and suppliers and 
distributors follow—and soon it won’t even be the fifth best location. 
 
Supply 
 
What work are people prepared to do? The employer bears significant responsibility for 
training workers to meet its needs and improving their productivity over time. But for 
this investment to make sense, the worker must demonstrate basic capabilities at the 
9 
 
outset. The better prepared the prospective workforce, the faster an employer can bring 
workers on board and the higher their wages will be. 
 
The students to whom the education system tailors its efforts will experience the 
greatest boost in their work prospects. This emphasis will also influence demand, as 
entrepreneurs build businesses where they expect to find well-prepared workers. If 
public schools offer a wide range of programs and lavish attention on those connected 
to the weakest segments of the labor market, they can push outcomes in a positive 
direction. If they adopt an attitude of “college or bust,” we shouldn’t be surprised to 
find a workforce consisting primarily of college graduates and busts. 
 
Boundaries 
 
Who gets to perform work and who gets to purchase it? When trade and immigration 
policies expand the pool of employers and consumers demanding various types of 
work, the workers able to provide it will likely see more opportunities—and higher 
wages. But when policies dramatically expand the supply of workers able to meet 
existing demand, domestic workers will suffer. In establishing a labor market’s 
boundaries, balance is therefore crucial. 
 
Unfortunately, in a wealthy country like the United States, balance will rarely be 
achieved for less-skilled workers if residents of poorer countries can participate without 
limit in the same labor market. Entrepreneurs gain access to a vastly larger and cheaper 
supply of labor, while imperatives vanish to build businesses that use the existing 
domestic labor supply or make investments in improving domestic workers’ 
capabilities. This effect swamps the smaller uptick in demand for less-skilled American 
labor that those workers might expect to see from the poorer countries’ consumers. 
 
Transactions 
 
How do workers and employers establish and manage their relationships? The set of 
negotiable terms and conditions and the rules of negotiation have a significant influence 
on the nature of transactions in any market. This is triply true in the labor market, 
where overlapping regimes of contract law, employment law, and labor law govern the 
efforts of workers and employers to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Any contract 
they wish to sign must grapple with the myriad rules that government imposes about 
hours, wages, conditions, benefits, and much more. On top of those rules, the presence 
of a union may introduce an additional layer of collective bargaining, itself controlled 
by government rules. 
 
In principle, allowing workers to bargain collectively should give them an opportunity 
to secure better terms than they might each achieve individually. Furthermore, by 
placing workers and employers on equal footing, concerns of unequal power and unfair 
10 
 
agreements fall by the wayside, reducing the need for government dictates. Why does 
the Department of Labor need to set the standard for overtime pay when the parties can 
be reasonably expected to work out this issue for themselves?  But done poorly, a 
system of organized labor can have the opposite effect, creating industry-wide cartels 
that negotiate agreements in the long-term interest of no one. 
 
Taxes 
 
How do the employer’s total cost and the worker’s take-home pay differ from the 
agreed-upon wage? The term tax is meant here in the broadest sense. Obviously, the 
direct taxes imposed on both employers and workers represent a large wedge inserted 
between the bargain that the parties might like to strike and the costs and benefits that 
they ultimately experience. But many other factors play a similar role, adding to the cost 
of becoming a worker or hiring one.  
 
Conversely, government can offer subsidies that offset tax burdens or even raise the 
transaction’s value to one or both parties beyond what the market offers. If society 
wants more from the labor market, it must consider paying for it. This can take forms 
ranging from tax credits for the employer or worker to direct subsidies that boost wages 
to better infrastructure that lowers transportation costs. 
 
* * * 
 
On each of these dimensions, America’s choices have been misguided. We overtax and 
underinvest in less-skilled workers, make them costly and risky to employers, and 
discourage investment in the industries where they could work most productively. At 
the same time, we free employers from the constraints of using the existing domestic 
workforce, offering them instead an option of using much cheaper foreign workers 
overseas or bringing the cheaper workers here. The immediate effects of these policy 
choices have often appeared beneficial, even to the workers who now find themselves 
disadvantaged. But those policies have, over time, reshaped the economy’s contours in 
ways that have left too many people out. 
 
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify on this important topic.

on the subject of  
“Connecting More People to Work” 
 
November 20, 2019 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, Madame Vice Chair, Members of the Joint Economic Committee, thank you for inviting 
me to discuss this important topic today. Getting more people into the labor market and into jobs is a 
central part of generating broadly shared growth and raising living standards.  
 
The United States—which used to be a world leader in labor force participation for both men and 
women—now substantially lags many other advanced economies. 
 
Although the overall U.S. labor force participation rate has been stable since approximately 2015, it had 
been on a downward trend beginning in the year 2000. Much, but not all, of that decline is attributable to 
the aging of the population as more adults are retirement age. Looking across age groups: younger adults 
are participating less than in the last century, largely because more of them are in school;1 adults over 55 
are participating at higher rates than in the late 1990s;2 participation for those aged 25–54 has been 
rebounding since 2015, but is still below its 1999 peak.3 There is room in the labor market for 
participation to rise.  
 
Economists often focus on those of “prime” working age, between 25 and 54, as they are usually neither 
in school nor retired in large numbers. Prime-age men have seen a persistent downward trend in 
participation over the last half century, largely due to declining rates among men with less education. 
Research has shown that this group has seen a decline in demand for their labor, and prime-age men with 
less than a high school education actually make $3.40 less an hour (adjusted for inflation) than they did in 
1980.4  
 
Reducing gaps in labor force participation  
 
In my work with The Hamilton Project, we have argued that a great deal can be learned about how to lift 
participation from looking at the gaps across groups and the specific barriers some face. For example, 
while prime-age men with a bachelor’s degree or more participate at a rate of 94 percent, those with a

of American Youth.”  
2 Bureau of Labor Statistics 2019. For more details on labor force participation trends of older workers, see Bauer, 
Lauren, Patrick Liu, and Jay Shambaugh, 2019, “Is the Continued Rise of Older Americans in the Workforce 
Necessary for Future Growth?”

4 Author’s calculations using Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group data for 1980 and 2018. Data 
adjusted for inflation using the CPI-U-RS.  
 
high school degree only participate at 86 percent, and those with less than a high school education 
participate at just 80 percent.5 For those with less education, taking steps to increase training and 
education along with other steps to lift wages could improve their labor market outcomes and directly lift 
participation.6 
 
Low-wage U.S. labor markets are unstable, and the data show that low-wage workers are more likely to 
have irregular schedules and to cycle in and out of the labor force. Relying on a one-month snapshot can 
overestimate how many are truly out of the labor force as opposed to struggling to stay in it. In fact, of 
those out of the labor force in a given month who are not disabled, students, retirees, or caregivers, at 
least 76 percent are actually in the labor force at some point in the next 16 months.7 Improving worker 
pay, schedules, bargaining power, and worker rights in these jobs to make them more stable could help.8  
 
Women represent the largest pool of untapped labor in today’s labor market. U.S. women used to lead the 
world in participation rates; today they are in the middle of the pack of advanced economies. Of the 22 
million prime-age individuals out of the labor force, almost 11 million list “taking care of family 
member” as the reason they are not in the labor force—and 90 percent of those individuals are women.9 
 
While some are home by choice, 35 percent of women who say they want a job but are not working list 
family responsibilities as the barrier.10 Evidence shows that better availability of childcare (and 
eldercare)—in particular for lower income households—would allow more who want to work to be in the 
labor force and that well-designed parental leave policies could keep more women attached to the labor 
force after having children.11 
 
There are also massive gaps in labor force participation across places. In top-ranked counties, 88 percent 
of prime-age adults are in the labor force compared to 70 percent in bottom-ranked counties.12 This gap 
dwarfs the drop in overall participation from 1999 to 2014. Place-based policies that try to spur labor 
demand in struggling regions could lift national participation. They are also important in their own right 
as a way to provide better economic opportunity and outcomes to a wider swath of Americans.13

counties. Author’s calculations based on 2013–17 American Community Survey.

There are also huge barriers to labor force participation of the formerly incarcerated. Removing those 
barriers and reducing the punitiveness of the criminal justice system is imperative.14 African American 
men have lower rates of participation, likely due in part to disproportionate incarceration rates as well as 
what studies show to be considerable discrimination in labor markets. 15 Combatting these barriers is  
important.  
 
Finally, the second largest group out of the labor force—after caregivers—are those listing health or 
disability as a barrier. This includes physical health, mental health, and addiction. We need better 
healthcare and treatment to keep people in the labor market. 
 
It is important to note that it is poor health, not the safety net, that is a major barrier to work. Not all of 
those listing health or disability as a reason for being out of the labor force receive disability payments,16 
and reported health measures for this group show sharply worse health relative to the overall population.17  
 
Furthermore, there is no evidence that increasing work requirements in SNAP or introducing them in 
Medicaid lifts labor force participation meaningfully. Reforms to the disability system making it easier 
for those with health limitations to work could help;18 however, this would still not address the combined 
barriers this population faces of chronic health challenges coupled with low market wages. 
 
Creating jobs is also crucial. A strong economy can raise wages, force employers to cast a wider net to 
find workers, and draw people into the labor market. Conversely, economic downturns damage labor 
force participation and should be minimized by making more use of automatic fiscal stabilizers.19

discrimination, see Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) and Goldin and Rouse (2000) among many others. 
16 Of those prime-age individuals citing poor health as the reason they did not work in the prior year, 64 percent 
actually receive disability income based on author’s calculations using data from the 2018 Current Population 
Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement. Disability income includes income from Disability Insurance; 
workers compensation; veterans benefits; disability related income from Social Security or Supplemental Security 
Income; and disability benefits from a company, union, state or local government, U.S. railroad retirement, or 
private accident or disability insurance. This is an underestimate due to the known problem of the CPS 
undercounting receipt of disability income. Joint Economic Committee Republican Staff (2018) states that 75 
percent of those listing disability as a reason for nonparticipation received SSDI or SSI based on a different data set. 
17 See Joint Economic Committee Republican Staff (2018) who report lower overall reported mental and physical 
health for this group, Bauer and Shambaugh (2018) who show that SNAP recipients who are labor force 
nonparticipants due to health are highly likely to have disabilities and take daily prescription medication, and Coile 
and Duggan (2019) who show worsening health status for prime-age men from 2000 to today—especially for those 
with less education—consistent with rising numbers of individuals out of the labor force due to health. 
Schanzenbach et al. (2016) shows deteriorating health for 25–49 year-olds and sharply lower health for those with 
low incomes. 
18 See Autor, David, and Mark Duggan, 2010, “Supporting Work: A Proposal for Modernizing the U.S. Disability 
Insurance System”; and Liebman, Jeffrey B., and Jack A. Smalligan, 2013, “An Evidence-Based Path to Disability 
Insurance Reform.”

American Economy.  
 
Americans are trying to work, but they often face major barriers. Ninety-four percent of prime-age adults 
out of the labor force are either disabled, taking care of relatives, students, or retired.20 It is removing 
barriers and maintaining strong labor markets that should be a policy focus. 
 
I look forward to any questions.

Testimony of Jose Ortiz, Jr. 
Executive Director, NYC Employment and Training Coalition 
As delivered to the Joint Economic Committee 
Hearing on “Connecting More People to Work” 
November 20, 2019 
 
Good afternoon and thank you Chairman Lee, Chairwoman Maloney and members of the Joint Economic 
Committee for holding this hearing and for the invitation to speak before you today. I’ll be speaking to the 
need to more effectively address labor force participation gaps amongst marginalized populations, 
especially those without college degrees, due to barriers to workforce development, training and 
employment. 
 
My name is Jose Ortiz, Jr. and I am the Executive Director of the New York City Employment and 
Training Coalition. NYCETC supports the workforce development community to ensure that every New 
Yorker has access to the skills, training and education needed to thrive in the local economy, and that 
every business is able to maintain a highly skilled workforce. Our 160 member organizations provide job 
training and employment services annually to more than 500,000 underserved New Yorkers. Everyday, 
the workforce development system demonstrates that, given the appropriate tools to address specific 
individual and systemic challenges, people are resilient and capable of learning at any stage of their lives.  
 
The country is experiencing unprecedented economic growth, and while we know that talent exists 
everywhere -- in towns and cities large and small -- a significant percentage of people across the nation 
lack relevant work experience and professional skill that would make them viable candidates for 
employment across industries. Research shows us that while 53 percent of all jobs in today’s labor market 
are middle skill, only 43 percent of U.S. workers are trained at this level, which means that industries 
cannot grow to their full potential and American workers face highly limited pathways into careers with 
good wages.1  
 
In addition to the moral imperative, there is an economic imperative to increasing investments in 
workforce development. Sixty-two percent of small and mid-sized business leaders reported that it is 
difficult to find skilled workers.2 Seventy-nine percent of these business leaders also expressed their 
support for new, public investments in workforce policies.3 Additionally, 64% of business leaders say 
increased government funding for support services to help people finish skills training programs will help 
their business.4  
 
To maximize national economic growth, meet employers’ talent needs, and eliminate the widening wage 
gap, we must do better at helping Americans gain the competencies and credentials required for 
in-demand careers. Roughly 75 million people who are unemployed, underemployed, or not working but 
not counted in unemployment figures:5

● 6.5 million unemployed (including 1.3 million long-term unemployed 6 
● 1.6 million not working but not counted in unemployment figures 7 
● ~ 68 million earning less than $15 per hour 8 
 
Included in these numbers are: 
● Adults without a postsecondary credential 
● Adults living in poverty 
● Individuals with some college but no credential 
● Young people ages 16-24 not in school or working 
 
Effective workforce programs contain the following critical components that, when combined and 
structured to be reactive to each individual’s needs, provide people with the deep intervention and 
intensive services required to ensure successful entry and growth in a career: 
 
● Employers inform workforce development providers and educational institutions on the skills 
needed for jobs 
○ Build in-demand skills rooted in labor market data 
○ Employer and community partnerships (ex. curriculum development, internship 
opportunities, funding) 
○ Access to internship or on-the-job learning 
○ Industry-recognized credentials: industry certifications, occupational licenses, and 
apprenticeship certificates 
● Intensive and immersive programs engage participants and provide them with skills development 
in areas required for each profession 
○ Trainings are specialized, integrating technical, behavioral and mindset skills 
○ Professional development, communication skills, time management, resume prep and 
support with online job tools, interview skills, teamwork and leadership training, and 
strategies to address imposter syndrome 
● Instruction is provided in a variety of ways including in conventional classroom experiences, 
online, and video including new tools like mobile 
● Regular assessments to identify and address problems so that students can display a mastery of 
skills 
● Wraparound services: transportation, childcare, mental health supports, and other services 
● Retention and advancement services 
 
The efficacy of these programs is backed up by the on-the-ground experience of our members working 
hand in hand with local employers to taylor programs to their needs and those of individuals, our 
discussions with employers large and small, and long standing research. These programs also have 
unquestionable results. Recent data suggests that taxpayers reap as much as $4 for every $1 spent on 
workforce programs.9 
6 The “long-term unemployed” are individuals who have been unemployed for 27 or more weeks. 
7  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not count these people as unemployed because they had not searched 
for work in the four weeks preceding the survey. However, they are individuals who are not in the labor force, who 
wanted and were available for work, and who had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months.

Per Scholas, which provides tuition-free technology training to adults across the country for careers as IT 
professionals, and the hundreds of people it trains is a clear example of the impact of workforce programs. 
Per Scholas’ track record includes a 400% increase in graduates’ post-training income and an 80% 
placement rate into quality and stable careers in the growing tech field. Deris of Cinncinati is a 38-year 
old man that exemplifies the tenacity and potential that exists in all of our communities. Having to drop 
out of college due to family obligations, Deris spent years in “tech adjacent” jobs with limited career 
growth. As valedictorian of his 14 week IT Support course10 equipped with CompTIA A+ and Network+ 
certifications, he found a job as a contractor with TEKSystems, a Per Scholas Signature Partner insurance 
group, working on an Internet Security team. His new confidence, in-demand skills and network of tech 
employers has enabled him to provide much more stability and health to his children, and even prompted 
him to start a business around work with high school students and computer troubleshooting skills called 
Youth Tech Café.  
 
Additionally, labor market data points to the fact that the needs of industry and their respective businesses 
are changing more rapidly than ever before. Technological shifts require that workers are trained to meet 
the needs of not only today, but also tomorrow. These changes are not only affecting those individuals 
from lower socioeconomic backgrounds with less educational attainment, this is also affecting individuals 
who have some college experience or a degree like Deris, making it more difficult to gain access to and 
compete for jobs in today’s labor market. 
 
In New York, there is a direct correlation with higher unemployment rates amongst individuals who 
identify as Black, Latinx, and female,11 making programs like Per Scholas - whose students are 87 percent 
people of color and 30 percent women - and STRIVE critical to closing this talent gap.12 
 
DeAsia, a young black woman who found herself on her own at the age of 16 bouncing from state to state 
looking for work opportunities, is a prime example of the specific barriers to employment that many black 
women face and the spectacular impacts that a job training program equipped with soft skills training and 
wraparound support has been proven to have. She had been through personal trauma, was struggling to 
earn a living, suffered from depression. When she became pregnant with her son Jeramiah she found 
herself living in a domestic violence shelter, seeking a career to ensure a better life for them both. At 
STRIVE - a 35 year old organization whose programs facilitate the personal and professional growth 
needed for people who face the biggest obstacles to employment to find and retain employment in several 
states across the US - DeAsia got the training she needed to thrive and found the support system she'd 
been missing. Her participation in the 12 week Career Pathways program, which included attitudinal 
training, professional skills, work readiness and sector-based occupational skills training in Health & 
Office Operations led to her earning a Medical Billing and Coding certification and opened doors to a 
multitude of jobs with opportunity for career advancement at STRIVE’s healthcare employer partners. 
She was first hired at Northwell Health in New York City in an entry-level position with a starting salary 
of $13 per hour, and has since advanced to earn a double Master’s in Healthcare Administration and 
Business Management and is an Insurance Authorization Specialist at Northwell with a middle-class 
salary of over $52,000 per year.

However, we know that this is a problem that is not isolated to these populations, and is also affecting 
non-college educated whites across the nation, and especially individuals with additional challenges to 
employment such as criminal justice histories or substance abuse issues. To tackle these challenges, 
organizations like Seedco, a national nonprofit dedicated to advancing economic opportunity for people, 
businesses, and communities in need, have targeted programs that combine in-demand skill development 
with behavioral and interpersonal development.  
 
Jared, a 24 year old white man born and raised in rural Arkansas and an early criminal history, sought out 
Seedco in Memphis, Tennessee seeking to transform his life and travel down a positive pathway through 
work. Participating in the “Turning Point Young Adult Re-Entry Program” enabled him to think critically 
about how own choices, explore viable career pathways, and led him to the Kingdom Low-Voltage 
Apprenticeship Program. Jared is currently earning $11.50/per hour with Torry Low-Voltage 
Communications, LLC while training to become a certified Telecommunications Technician. This is 
significantly higher than the Tennessee minimum wage of $7.25/hour. Telecommunications is a field that 
continues to provide extensive career opportunities as the Mid-South region is experiencing significant 
expansion in the construction industry via hotels, business expansions, and additional projects over the 
next 10 years. Due to this growth, there will be a need for trained installers of cabling like Jared in the 
buildings as they are erected. Being employed has also allowed Jared to overcome additional barriers. He 
was able to pay multiple outstanding fines in Arkansas, complete the Alcohol and Drug Safety Education 
Program and secure a room in a group housing facility.  
 
Employment training programs like Seedco are not only critical to connecting more people to work, but 
are also pivotal to our nation’s ability to remain competitive in the face of automation and the radical 
impact it will have on all facets of our economy. Over the next 10 years, more than 10% of all 
occupations can be fully automated.13 Automation will affect occupations that include bus drivers and 
nurse assistants, stock clerks and travel agents, dental lab technicians, sewing machine operators and 
assembly-line workers.14 The same study found that 40% of all work activities have the potential to be 
automated using current demonstrated technologies.15 The largest occupational categories in the US 
economy are also the ones with the greatest potential for automation-related displacement - office 
support; construction; mining; agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; retail trade; accommodation and 
food services; and manufacturing.16 This will affect individuals and economies across all states that we 
represent, in cities and towns that we all call home and love.  
 
Across the U.S.17 
● Workers with a high school diploma or less are four times more likely to lose their jobs; 
● 11.9 million Blacks and Latinx are projected to be displaced; and  
● 14.7 million young workers between the ages of 18 and 34, as well as 11.5 millions workers who 
are 50 years of age or older will lose their jobs 
 
Couple these challenges with the likelihood of another economic downturn in the foreseeable future, 
significant labor market challenges will continue to persist for both workers and employers.

The good news is that job growth will be net positive over the next 10 years. Specifically, jobs are 
projected to grow in occupations including solar installers, wind turbine technicians, health professions 
(health aides, technicians, occupational therapy assistants, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and 
wellness), personal care aides, information security analysts, statisticians, speech language pathologists.18 
Jobs that are projected to grow in occupations and/or be transformed include including health professions, 
STEM, creatives and arts, business and legal professions, management, education and workforce training, 
and customer service and sales.19 
 
And as these jobs are created and/or are transformed, workers must develop new in-demand skills to meet 
employer needs. Therefore, these complex challenges require complex interventions and investments, and 
the collective action of all stakeholders across the system, to ensure more workers have career pathways 
into these new roles and businesses have viable talent. As the stories of Deris, DeAsia, Jared and the 
organizations that trained and supported them along the way show - we can equip people with the 21st 
century skills needed to change the impact of automation from “elimination” to “transformation” by 
focusing investments and policies in the following ways: 
 
● Government agencies can partner with educational institutions, providers, and intermediaries at 
earliest stages of economic development and re-zoning initiatives to ensure local workers are 
trained for and have access to employment opportunities; 
● Workforce Investment Boards can help direct investments for programs that train people for 
in-demand roles in the local economy; 
● NGOs and Foundations can fund and assist in the designing of innovative solutions for hard to 
solve problems; 
● Companies can internally design programs for retraining incumbent workers; and work with 
external partners to develop target programs to develop new talent pipelines; 
● Educational institutions and job training providers can form partnerships to train incumbent 
workers and develop new pipelines that provide access for new talent. Describe clear ROI for 
investors and employers; and 
● Industry and Labor Organizations can support workers in identifying training for, and 
transitioning to, in-demand roles 
 
There are many more examples of individuals that, with their hard work and dedication, have overcome 
their personal and institutional barriers to employment. However, each of these success stories includes a 
deep investment capital and other resources in order to ensure that each worker not only finds, but also 
retains employment for many years to come. In many instances, individuals may still require certain 
public benefits as they regain their footing. In the long-term, these significant investments will lead to 
individuals and families that are more likely to be self-sufficient. 
 
This task is enormous. However, the federal government must ensure that workforce development 
programs like the ones highlighted and the hundreds that are not, are funded. All Americans, especially 
those in the untapped workforce, need increased access and supportive services to succeed in job training 
programs and industry-recognized credentials, and corresponding careers. Once successful, we will raise 
the standards of living for all who reside in our towns and cities across America. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement  
JEC Hearing on “Connecting More People to Work” 
November 20, 2019, 2:15pm 
106 Dirksen Senate Office Building 
 
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for this hearing of 
the Joint Economic Committee. 
The American labor market is strong. The current economic 
expansion is the longest in U.S. history. Our unemployment rate 
has remained at or below 4 percent for the last 20 months and 
continues to fall. Average wage growth has slowed down a bit, but 
remains strongest for lower paid workers. The gains have been 
broadly shared: African-American and Hispanic unemployment 
rates are at all-time lows. Female labor force participation is 
approaching an all-time high. And analysts speculate that we still 
have yet to reach “full employment.”  
Yet, behind these indicators of recent strength, there lies a 
worrisome, long-term trend—what Nicholas Eberstadt of the 
American Enterprise Institute has called an “invisible crisis.” Many 
American men are leaving the workforce altogether. Though on 
the rise, the employment-to-population ratio for prime-age men—
those between the ages of 25 and 54—is near levels not seen 
since the Great Depression. Even in today’s strong labor market, 
Page 1 of 3 
 
we see that once taut connections to the workplace have not only 
slackened, but frayed. 
The economic implications of such disconnection should be clear 
to all. But the Joint Economic Committee’s Social Capital Project, 
as part of its mission to understand “associational life” in America 
today, has studied the plight of these disconnected men and 
identified potentially greater consequences for the health of our 
families and communities. In its report, “Inactive, Disconnected, 
and Ailing: A Portrait of Prime-age Men Out of the Labor Force,” 
the Project found that disconnected men are more socially 
isolated and less happy than their employed peers. At the 
community level, the disappearance of work can lead to 
depopulation, brain drain, and the decline of other institutions of 
civil society.  
If we are to expand opportunity by strengthening families, 
communities, and civil society, we must devote our attention to 
work—a means of supporting ourselves and our families, a 
source of meaning and purpose, and a site for affirming and 
satisfying relationships. I hope that our discussions this afternoon 
give us a clearer sense of how to connect more Americans to this 
wellspring of opportunity and social capital. 
Page 2 of 3 
 
At this afternoon’s hearing, we will seek to better understand the 
forces shaping the labor market and Americans’ connections to it. 
A variety of reasons have been offered to explain why fewer 
Americans in their prime earning years are joining the workforce. 
Several interdependent themes emerge from most analyses: 
declining economic dynamism, falling worker mobility, stagnating 
wages, trade exposure, employment polarization, skill-biased 
technological change, and an expanding safety net.  
Our next step will be to consider policy reforms consonant with 
the most plausible explanations for declining prime-age labor 
force participation. What barriers to opportunity can we identify 
and try to remove? How might incentives to join the workforce be 
strengthened? How might we more smartly invest in human and 
social capital to create new opportunities? Possible solutions may 
involve reforming the safety net, modernization of labor 
regulations, and increasing wage growth. 
The Social Capital Project will cover all of these topics in a 
forthcoming report, to be informed by the insights of today’s 
panelists. I look forward to their testimonies and to a productive 
conversation aimed at drawing disconnected Americans off the 
sidelines and into the workplace. 
I now recognize Senator Hassan for opening remarks.

Opening Statement: Joint Economic Committee Hearing 
“Connecting More People to Work” 
Senator Maggie Hassan 
November 20, 2019 
 
 
Thank you Chairman Lee for focusing this committee’s attention on the important issue of 
getting more Americans to participate in our workforce.  
 
And thank you to our witnesses for being here today.  
 
Members of both parties agree that we must increase labor force participation.  
 
While low unemployment rates in my home state of New Hampshire and across the country are 
welcome news, we know that a low unemployment rate can also present real challenges – from 
businesses not being able to find workers, to additional pressure being put on the productivity of 
our current workforce.  
 
For a variety of reasons, too many Americans are falling out of the workforce. And a smaller 
percentage of Americans participating in the workforce can drag on economic growth.  
 
It is critical that we address the root causes that result in people not seeking employment. And 
today’s hearing presents an opportunity to address those factors and look toward bipartisan 
solutions.  
 
To start, as our economy changes rapidly, individuals may not have the skills and supports that 
they need to enter – and remain – in the workforce. And I have heard from businesses throughout 
New Hampshire that one of their top challenges is finding more qualified workers, even at entry 
level jobs.  
 
Addressing this challenge requires us to both strengthen job training efforts and remove the 
barriers that prevent too many people from participating or remaining in the workforce.  
 
I have introduced bipartisan legislation – the Gateway to Careers Act – that would do just that.  
 
This bill would provide grants to support partnerships between community or technical colleges 
and workforce development partners such as state workforce development boards, industry 
associations, and community-based organizations.  
 
These partnerships would help remove many of the barriers that prevent too many people from 
completing a 2-year degree or credential by connecting them to support services, including 
housing, mental health and substance use disorder treatment, assistance in obtaining health 
insurance coverage, offering career counseling, transportation, and other services.  
 
By strengthening job training and support services we can connect more people with the tools 
that they need to enter and succeed in our changing economy.  
 
Another systemic barrier that many Americans face is a lack of access to paid leave and child 
care.  
 
Frequently, those who want to work are held back by pressing family responsibilities that make it 
impossible. A recent report by the Hamilton Project showed that 9.6 million women who are not 
participating in our workforce list family and home responsibilities are their primary reason.  
 
Mr. Chair, I request that the Hamilton Project Report: “Labor Force Nonparticipation. Trends, 
Causes and Policy Solutions” be entered in the record.  
 
By enacting more family-friendly policies that enable people to balance their work and family 
responsibilities we can help more people join or rejoin the labor market.  
 
We also must break down employment barriers facing traditionally disadvantaged communities.  
 
In 2018, Brookings found that only four out of ten working-age adults who experience 
disabilities are employed. So we also need to address the challenges that those who experience 
disabilities encounter in entering our workforce.   
 
As Governor, I signed legislation banning employers from paying workers with disabilities at a 
lower rate than the minimum wage, making New Hampshire the first state in the nation to ban 
sub-minimum wages. We must make this a federal priority – which is why I have cosponsored 
the Transformation to Competitive Employment Act, which would phase out the practice of 
paying a sub-minimum wage to workers with disabilities nationwide.  
 
We should also make sure that workers who experience disabilities receive the support they need 
to succeed in the workplace and are less likely to fall out of the labor market.  
 
Finally, no conversation about increasing participation in our workforce can exclude addressing 
the costs of higher education.  
 
Right now, students face far too many obstacles in getting the education that they need – 
particularly when it comes to affordability.  
 
No one who is pursuing higher education so that they can build a better future for themselves – 
and in turn our economy – should have to put that goal on hold because they can’t afford it. And 
they should not have to take on substantial debt to do so either.  
 
I’ll continue working on strategies to increase college affordability and to lower the burden of 
student debt, so that more workers can get the education that they need to thrive.  
 
We can all agree that tackling our workforce challenges requires a multi-faceted and 
comprehensive approach.  
 
There’s not a single solution. And we have multiple opportunities to connect more people to 
work.  
I look forward to hearing more from our witnesses today.  
 
And now, I’ll turn it back over to Chairman Lee. "

Statement by 
 
Jerome H. Powell 
 
Chair 
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 
before the 
 
Joint Economic Committee 
 
U.S. Congress 
 
 November 13, 2019 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Maloney, and members of the Committee, I appreciate the 
opportunity to testify before you today.  Let me start by saying that my colleagues and I strongly 
support the goals of maximum employment and price stability that Congress has set for monetary 
policy.  We are committed to providing clear explanations about our policies and actions.  
Congress has given us an important degree of independence so that we can effectively pursue our 
statutory goals based on facts and objective analysis.  We appreciate that our independence 
brings with it an obligation for transparency and accountability.  Today I will discuss the outlook 
for the economy and monetary policy. 
The Economic Outlook 
The U.S. economy is now in the 11th year of this expansion, and the baseline outlook 
remains favorable.  Gross domestic product increased at an annual pace of 1.9 percent in the 
third quarter of this year after rising at around a 2.5 percent rate last year and in the first half of 
this year.  The moderate third-quarter reading is partly due to the transitory effect of the United 
Auto Workers strike at General Motors.  But it also reflects weakness in business investment, 
which is being restrained by sluggish growth abroad and trade developments.  These factors have 
also weighed on exports and manufacturing this year.  In contrast, household consumption has 
continued to rise solidly, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and favorable levels 
of consumer confidence.  And reflecting the decline in mortgage rates since late 2018, residential 
investment turned up in the third quarter following an extended period of weakness. 
The unemployment rate was 3.6 percent in October—near a half-century low.  The pace 
of job gains has eased this year but remains solid; we had expected some slowing after last year’s 
strong pace.  At the same time, participation in the labor force by people in their prime working 
  - 2 - 
years has been increasing.  Ample job opportunities appear to have encouraged many people to 
join the workforce and others to remain in it.  This is a very welcome development.   
The improvement in the jobs market in recent years has benefited a wide range of 
individuals and communities.  Indeed, recent wage gains have been strongest for lower-paid 
workers.  People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many 
who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to 
their lives.  Significant differences, however, persist across different groups of workers and 
different areas of the country:  Unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics are 
still well above the jobless rates for whites and Asians, and the proportion of the people with a 
job is lower in rural communities.   
Inflation continues to run below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 
symmetric 2 percent objective.  The total price index for personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) increased 1.3 percent over the 12 months ending in September, held down by declines in 
energy prices.  Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices and tends to be a 
better indicator of future inflation, was 1.7 percent over the same period.   
Looking ahead, my colleagues and I see a sustained expansion of economic activity, a 
strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely.  This 
favorable baseline partly reflects the policy adjustments that we have made to provide support 
for the economy.  However, noteworthy risks to this outlook remain.  In particular, sluggish 
growth abroad and trade developments have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks.  
Moreover, inflation pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations 
are at the lower end of their historical ranges.  Persistent below-target inflation could lead to an 
  - 3 - 
unwelcome downward slide in longer-term inflation expectations.  We will continue to monitor 
these developments and assess their implications for U.S. economic activity and inflation. 
We also continue to monitor risks to the financial system.  Over the past year, the overall 
level of vulnerabilities facing the financial system has remained at a moderate level.  Overall, 
investor appetite for risk appears to be within a normal range, although it is elevated in some 
asset classes.  Debt loads of businesses are historically high, but the ratio of household 
borrowing to income is low relative to its pre-crisis level and has been gradually declining in 
recent years.  The core of the financial sector appears resilient, with leverage low and funding 
risk limited relative to the levels of recent decades.  At the end of this week, we will be releasing 
our third Financial Stability Report, which shares our detailed assessment of the resilience of the 
U.S. financial system. 
Monetary Policy 
Over the past year, weakness in global growth, trade developments, and muted inflation 
pressures have prompted the FOMC to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path of interest 
rates.  Since July, the Committee has lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 
3/4 percentage point.  These policy adjustments put the current target range at 1-1/2 to 
1-3/4 percent.   
The Committee took these actions to help keep the U.S. economy strong and inflation 
near our 2 percent objective and to provide some insurance against ongoing risks.  As monetary 
policy operates with a lag, the full effects of these adjustments on economic growth, the job 
market, and inflation will be realized over time.  We see the current stance of monetary policy as 
likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly 
  - 4 - 
consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation 
near our symmetric 2 percent objective. 
We will be monitoring the effects of our policy actions, along with other information 
bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds 
rate.  Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we 
would respond accordingly.  Policy is not on a preset course. 
The FOMC is committed to ensuring that its policy framework remains well positioned to 
meet its statutory goals.  We believe our existing framework has served us well.  Nonetheless, 
the current low interest rate environment may limit the ability of monetary policy to support the 
economy.  We are currently conducting a public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, 
and communications—the first of its kind for the Fed.  With the U.S. economy operating close to 
maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct such a 
review.  Through our Fed Listens events, we have been hearing a diverse range of perspectives 
not only from academic experts, but also from representatives of consumer, labor, business, 
community, and other groups.  We will draw on these insights as we assess how best to achieve 
and maintain maximum employment and price stability.  We will continue to report on our 
discussions in the minutes of our meetings and share our conclusions when we finish the review, 
likely around the middle of next year.   
In a downturn, it would also be important for fiscal policy to support the economy.  
However, as noted in the Congressional Budget Office’s recent long-term budget outlook, the 
federal budget is on an unsustainable path, with high and rising debt:  Over time, this outlook 
could restrain fiscal policymakers’ willingness or ability to support economic activity during a 
  - 5 - 
downturn.1  In addition, I remain concerned that high and rising federal debt can, in the longer 
term, restrain private investment and, thereby, reduce productivity and overall economic growth.  
Putting the federal budget on a sustainable path would aid the long-term vigor of the U.S. 
economy and help ensure that policymakers have the space to use fiscal policy to assist in 
stabilizing the economy if it weakens. 
I will conclude with a few words on the technical implementation of monetary policy.  In 
January, the FOMC made the key decision to continue to implement monetary policy in an 
ample-reserves regime.  In such a regime, we will continue to control the federal funds rate 
primarily by setting our administered rates, not through frequent interventions to actively 
manage the supply of reserves.  In the transition to the efficient and effective level of reserves in 
this regime, we slowed the gradual decline in our balance sheet in May, and stopped it in July.  
In response to the funding pressures in money markets that emerged in mid-September, we 
decided to maintain a level of reserves at or above the level that prevailed in early September.  
To achieve this level of reserves, we announced in mid-October that we would purchase 
Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year and would continue temporary open 
market operations at least through January.  These actions are purely technical measures to 
support the effective implementation of monetary policy as we continue to learn about the 
appropriate level of reserves.  They do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy. 
Thank you.  I would be pleased to take your questions.

Opening Statement  
JEC Hearing on “The Economic Outlook” 
Wednesday, November 13, 2019, 11:00am 
216 Hart Senate Office Building 
 
Good morning and welcome all to the Joint Economic 
Committee’s annual hearing with the Chair of the Federal 
Reserve’s Board of Governors. I would like to extend a 
warm welcome to Chairman Jerome Powell, and I look 
forward to our discussion on monetary policy and the state 
of the economy. 
Our economy has finally recovered from the financial crisis 
of 2008. Unemployment reached a 50-year low of 3.5 
percent in September and most recently stood at 3.6 
percent. The share of working-age adults with a job has 
returned to pre-crisis levels. 
However, despite this welcome return to normalcy in 
employment measures, many aspects of the economy 
remain unusual—and particularly so for central bankers. 
Inflation remains persistently low; in four of the past five 
1 
 
quarters, inflation has been below the Federal Reserve’s 
two percent target.  
Treasury yields also remain low, with a ten-year borrowing 
rate of just 1.9 percent. Interest rates that once were 
considered extraordinarily low have become a long-run 
expectation. 
These phenomena of low inflation and low long-term 
interest rates are not unique to the United States, but 
rather, echoed in most developed markets around the 
world today. 
This moment brings with it some challenges, such as 
building a framework for fighting recessions in a low-
interest-rate environment. However, it also brings 
opportunities: with inflation still in check, we may yet have 
room to expand employment even further. 
As ever, it will be important for the Federal Reserve Board 
to communicate how it addresses these challenges and 
opportunities. In this regard, the greater transparency 
2 
 
demonstrated by the Federal Reserve during the 
Chairman’s tenure is to be commended. In particular, it 
has conducted a number of Fed Listens events around the 
country, including an historic conference held in June, to 
hear feedback on current policy conduct as well as to 
better understand the effects of monetary policy at the 
local level. Not only will these initiatives promote trust in 
Federal Reserve decision-making, they will provide 
important information relevant to monetary policy from 
Americans who do not always get a seat at the table. 
We hope to discuss these topics and more with Chairman 
Powell. 
Before I introduce our esteemed witness, I will now yield to 
Vice Chair Maloney for her opening remarks. Thank you.

CONGRESSWOMAN CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
 
Opening Statement of Representative Carolyn B. Maloney (NY-12) 
Vice Chair, Joint Economic Committee 
Hearing with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell 
November 13, 2019 
 
 
Thank you, Chairman Powell, for testifying today.  
 
I look forward to hearing your perspective on the current state of the economy and the potential 
challenges ahead. 
 
I’d also like to thank you for your thoughtfulness as you help steer the economy through what in 
some ways are challenging times. 
 
As you have said in your testimony, by some measures, our economy is strong.  
 
The national unemployment rate fell from 10 percent at its peak during the Great Recession to 
only 4.7 percent when President Trump took office.  
 
And it has continued to fall; it now stands at only 3.6 percent.  
 
The economy has continued to add jobs – now for 109 consecutive months – more than nine 
years.  
 
Inflation remains low, below the Fed’s target.  
 
Wages are moving up, though not as fast as we would like. 
 
But other measures tell a different story.  
 
GDP growth has slowed -- falling below 2 percent in the third quarter. 
 
Job growth is also slowing. In fact, it has lagged behind the last years of the Obama 
administration. 
 
About 35,000 fewer jobs have been added per month during the first 33 months of Trump than 
the last 33 months of Obama.  
 
Manufacturing is in recession, business investment has been shrinking for the past two quarters 
and productivity fell last quarter for the first time since 2015. 
 
Some of these more troubling developments may be a sign of a possible end to our decade-long 
economic expansion. 
 
Or a slow fade from the “sugar high” of the 2017 tax cuts. 
Page 1 
 
 
But the most likely cause of economic uncertainty is the President’s trade war. 
 
This leads to a fundamental question – how should the Federal Reserve act, when one of the 
major challenges facing our economy is the erratic behavior of our President himself? 
 
No – I won’t ask you to answer that question. But it’s on everyone’s mind. 
 
You have a tough job. 
 
In past months, you have conducted a Federal Reserve listening tour – “Fed Listens.” 
 
I want to thank you for taking the time to hear from Americans from all walks of life who 
experience our economy very differently. 
 
As you know, the economy as a whole can be very strong while entire segments of the U.S. 
population struggle. 
 
Some regions still have not recovered from the Great Recession.  
 
Not all demographic groups have shared equally in the economic growth of the past decade. 
As members of Congress, we need to serve all Americans. 
 
You have shown that this is your concern too. 
 
It used to be that “a rising tide lifts all boats.” 
 
But that has become less true, and we know that the tide lifts some boats much more than others. 
 
That’s why I have introduced legislation that would give us insight into whom the economy is 
working for.  
 
My bill, the Measuring Real Income Growth Act, would require the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis to report GDP growth by income decile and the top 1 percent alongside the topline 
number.  
 
It would tell us who is benefiting from economic growth. 
 
And that takes me back to the fundamental question before Fed policymakers.  
 
How low should unemployment go?  
 
How does the Fed weigh the benefits of very low unemployment vs. the risks of inflation?  
 
We’ve had 11 straight quarters of an unemployment rate below what CBO tells us is the so-
Page 2 
 
called natural rate of unemployment. 
 
Yet inflation remains comfortably below the Fed target rate. 
 
Which raises the question: has the traditional relationship between unemployment and inflation 
weakened?  
 
If it has, why? 
 
Is it downward price pressure from around the globe?  
 
Or, increased market concentration in certain industries in the United States eroding worker 
bargaining power?  
 
Or, are there other factors at play?  
 
And what if unemployment is extremely low – suggesting that we are at full employment, but the 
unemployment rate for African Americans or Latinos remains much higher? 
 
What if the unemployment rate for people in some communities, or those who work in some 
occupations, is stubbornly high? 
 
These are questions with wide-ranging implications for both fiscal and monetary policy. 
 
Chairman Powell, I’d like to close my remarks because we have a lot of ground to cover.  
But before I finish, let me again express my admiration. 
 
You have a tough job. Thanks for doing it.  
 
I look forward to your testimony.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY, VICE 
CHAIR, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM NEW YORK 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you so much. I want to thank all 
my colleagues for being here and all our distinguished panelists. I 
am Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. 
Last month, the Census Bureau reported that income inequality 
in the United States by one measure had reached its highest level 
since they began tracking it more than 50 years ago. For the typ-
ical worker, wages have been stagnant for decades, for four dec-
ades. On the other hand, those at the top are doing great. The top 
1 percent of households in the United States now take home about 
20 percent of the total income. 
The wealthiest 1 percent own nearly 40 percent of total wealth. 
Those at the very top, the top one-tenth of 1 percent, have seen 
their share of wealth double since 1990. That narrow sliver of the 
population, the top tenth of 1 percent, now own more than the bot-
tom 80 percent of Americans. 
One  of  our  witnesses  today,  Dr.  Zucman,  has  done  important 
work tracking these trends going back a century. His most recent 
work looks at the role played by our tax system. It is widely be-
lieved that our tax system is progressive, that the rich pay a larger 
percentage of their income in taxes. However, Dr. Zucman’s recent 
work reveals that in 2018, the wealthiest 400 Americans paid a 
lower total tax rate than any other income group. Sadly, this is not 
an accident. It is deliberate public policy.

In 2017, the Republican Congress and President Trump slashed 
taxes on the rich, borrowing $1.9 trillion to do it. Inequality in 
America was already sky-high. The Republican tax cut made it far 
worse. 
Skyrocketing inequality undermines our middle-class society in 
which anyone who works hard has a chance to succeed. It means 
that  for  millions  of  Americans,  the  American  dream  may  be  a 
myth. 
Our  second  witness,  economist  Heather  Boushey,  argues  that 
high  levels  of  inequality  undermine  economic  growth,  because 
strong growth depends, in part, on a strong middle class. Consumer 
spending accounts for 70 percent of the U.S. economy. But as a 
larger and larger share of income and wealth go to those at the top, 
there is less left over for everyone else. 
As a result, most Americans have less money in their pockets, 
less to spend on what businesses sell. Therefore, when the bottom 
50 percent, those who consume a much larger share of income com-
pared to those at the top, see no income growth for 40 years, that 
is a major problem. 
Extreme  inequality  also  undermines  our  communities.  The 
Chairman and I agree that healthy communities with strong social 
capital are critical to a high quality of life. But extreme inequality 
undermines that. 
When wealth is highly concentrated, and in a society where edu-
cation is critical to success, families have extremely high incentives 
to live in towns with other wealthy families so they can put their 
children in the best school systems. So Americans increasingly be-
come segregated by wealth, and their quality of life becomes de-
pendent on their ZIP Code. 
Extreme inequality also undermines our democratic institutions. 
It enables the powerful to rig the rules to make themselves even 
more powerful. We see the erosion of antitrust laws, the breakdown 
of protections for small investors, the rejection of overtime protec-
tions for workers. We pay a very high price for extreme inequality. 
How bad is inequality in the United States? Economists disagree 
about the severity of the problem, but while they disagree about 
how much inequality has worsened in recent decades, there is little 
disagreement things are getting worse. 
One way that we measure the strength of our economy is by 
quarterly measures of gross domestic product. It is a good aggre-
gate number. It tells us how fast the whole economic pie is grow-
ing. But the slices of the pie that go to the rich, middle class, and 
poor are extremely unequal. 
Unfortunately, we currently don’t measure how economic growth 
is shared. For this reason, I have introduced the Measuring Real 
Income Growth Act of 2019, and I am pleased that Senator Hein-
rich is introducing a companion bill in the Senate. The bill would 
require the Bureau of Economic Analysis to report GDP growth by 
income decile and the top 1 percent alongside the top line number. 
It will help us understand not just how fast the economy is grow-
ing, but who is benefiting from the growth. 
Academic economists, such as Dr. Zucman, have produced esti-
mates similar to those we are asking for from BEA, but we need 
the government to do this in a regular and timely manner.

Inequality is one of the most pressing issues of our day. It is 
tearing our society apart and undermining much of what we stand 
for. In order to understand inequality, we must have better ways 
to measure it, ways that are accepted by those on both sides of the 
aisle. With that information in hand, we can begin to restore our 
economy to the land of opportunity. 
I would now like to call on Chairman Lee for his opening state-
ment, and then we will go to the panelists. 
Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Vice Chair Maloney appears in the 
Submissions for the Record on page 36.] 
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE LEE, CHAIRMAN, A U.S. 
SENATOR FROM UTAH 
Chairman Lee. Thank you, Vice Chair Maloney, for holding this 
hearing. This is an interesting topic, and I look forward to our con-
versation this afternoon. 
Inequality has been a hinge of American politics. And indeed, 
something of a hinge in all democracies for as long as democracies 
have existed, and with some good reason. Concentration of eco-
nomic power can be as dangerous as the concentration of political 
power. 
Unfortunately, the debate about inequality, like far too many de-
bates these days, can easily be swept up into a partisan exercise 
of talking past each other. We could spend our entire time, and we 
could spend entire days for that matter, haggling over whether in-
equality is best understood as something that involves unequal op-
portunity or instead involves unequal outcomes. Or indeed, if the 
latter, we could argue for hours about whether and how much it 
is even a problem, given that almost every facet of modern life, 
from air conditioning to airplanes, can be counted among the bless-
ings of intentionally unequal benefits, the unequal benefits of free 
enterprise. 
Inequality is such a large concept that it is very difficult to tackle 
in a single hearing. That is why I commend Vice Chair Maloney 
for organizing today’s hearing on measuring inequality and for in-
viting such an excellent panel of witnesses to talk to us, people 
with a lot of expertise and insight. 
The subject of data measurement techniques is, at once, narrow 
enough  to  keep  our  discussion  focused  and,  hopefully,  technical 
enough that even Congress can set aside political temptations and 
simply drill down on some very important questions. 
For instance, how exactly should we define income for purposes 
of measuring inequality between rich, poor, and middle class? How 
should we count government transfers, like the earned income tax 
credit for lower income workers? As the scholarship on inequality 
measurement  has  progressed,  which  technical  details  have  sur-
vived peer-reviewed scrutiny and which remain to be worked out 
before we can reach some type of academic consensus? 
These are not the questions that will necessarily lead cable news 
political talk shows. That is why they are exactly the kinds of ques-
tions the Joint Economic Committee should be taking up. Even the 
best policies involve tradeoffs.

Our economy is growing. And today, our economy happens to em-
ploy more people than it ever has before. But it has, in fact, been 
a long slog out of the Great Recession, much longer for some, re-
grettably, than for others. 
If the data really can afford us a clearer view of how the costs 
and benefits of economic growth are being experienced as we move 
up and down the economic scales, as we move up and down the in-
come spectrum, that is the type of analysis we should all insist on 
getting and insist on making sure that we get it right. 
So thank you, again, Madam Vice Chair, and to the witnesses 
that we are going to hear from today. I look forward to hearing 
from you. 
[The prepared statement of Chairman Lee appears in the Sub-
missions for the Record on page 37.] 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you so much. 
And I am going to introduce our witnesses, and each will have 
5 minutes, and then we will go to questions. 
Dr. Gabriel Zucman is associate professor of economics at the 
University of California, Berkeley. His research focuses on distribu-
tion and taxation of global wealth. Professor Zucman is the author

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  GABRIEL  ZUCMAN,  ASSOCIATE  PRO-
FESSOR  OF  ECONOMICS,  UNIVERSITY  OF  CALIFORNIA, 
BERKELEY AND CO-DIRECTOR, WORLD INEQUALITY DATA-
BASE, BERKELEY, CA 
Dr. Zucman. Thank you, Chairman Lee and Vice Chair Malo-
ney, for inviting me to speak today. It is an honor to be here. 
My name is Gabriel Zucman, and I am an associate professor of 
economics at the University of California, Berkeley. My work seeks 
to  advance  the  measurement  of  inequality.  With  my  colleagues, 
Facundo Alvaredo, Lucas Chancel, Thomas Piketty, and Emmanuel 
Saez, I am one of the co-directors of the World Inequality Database, 
an  extensive  database  on  the  long-run  evolution  of  income  and 
wealth inequality. 
One of our goals is to contribute to the creation of comprehen-
sive, standardized, and internationally comparable inequality sta-
tistics that capture all forms of income contributing to GDP. So 
concretely, when GDP grows 3 percent, let’s say, in a given year, 
we want to be able to know how income is growing for each social 
group in a way that is consistent with the official rate of GDP 
growth. We call these statistics distributional national accounts. 
To understand the ultimate goal and the value of this project, the 
following analogy is helpful. According to the official national ac-
counts of the United States, real GDP grew 2.9 percent in 2018. 
This number involves some uncertainty. The measurement of GDP, 
after all, relies on many assumptions. 
There are projections based on preliminary reports that can only 
be confirmed months or years down the road. There are imputa-
tions, for example, of the rents that homeowners pay to themselves. 
There are assumptions about how much income is underreported 
by taxpayers to the IRS. But despite these uncertainties, most peo-
ple trust official estimates of GDP. 
These estimates are based on methods that have been improved 
over several decades. They are based on internationally agreed and 
constantly refined concepts and methods. They are constructed by 
hundreds of highly qualified government statisticians. 
My hope is that, one day, we will reach the point where statistics 
of inequality are constructed and regarded like GDP statistics. 
With my colleagues, we try to contribute to this evolution. We 
have  created  prototype  distributional  national  accounts,  that  is, 
statistics that distribute the national account aggregates—such as 
national income, household wealth, tax revenue, and government 
spending—across the population. These prototype distributional na-
tional accounts are based on the conceptual framework that we de-
veloped over several years. They are based on harmonized guide-
lines, concepts, and estimation techniques that we have applied 
and are applying to many countries. They are constantly updated 
when  new  data  becomes  available  and  refined  estimation  tech-
niques are designed. 
All the data series are made available in a user-friendly manner 
on the World Inequality Database, wid.world. All programs, com-
puter code, and technical appendices are publicly available. All our 
results can be replicated using publicly available data. Users are 
free to change our methodology, and we constantly refine our meth-
ods as we receive new feedback and new knowledge emerges.

These  prototype  distributional  national  accounts  show  a  large 
rise in income inequality. In 1980, the top 1 percent earned 10 per-
cent of total pretax income. Today, it earns about 20 percent of 
total pretax income. 
Although we have put a lot of effort in building this prototype, 
it remains a prototype. The methods underpinning our distribu-
tional national accounts are still in their infancy. Much more work 
needs to be done. 
Our hope is that these prototypes will eventually be taken over 
by government, improved, and published as part of the official tool-
kit of government statistics. This is what happened for the national 
accounts in the first place. 
It may take years, even decades, before this happens. But in the 
meantime,  it  is  perfectly  normal  to  have  methodological  discus-
sions,  debates,  and  disagreements.  This  does  not  mean  that  we 
cannot know what is happening to inequality today. 
A wide array of evidence shows high and rising inequality. Each 
of these sources has limitations. All economic statistics are con-
structions, whose limitations must be understood. But by working 
together, we can arrive at the best possible estimates and reach the 
stage where the publication of inequality statistics will be just like 
the publication of GDP. 
I look forward to your questions. Thank you.

sions for the Record on page 38.] 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you. 
Dr. Boushey. 
STATEMENT OF DR. HEATHER BOUSHEY, PRESIDENT & CEO 
AND CO-FOUNDER, WASHINGTON CENTER FOR EQUITABLE 
GROWTH, WASHINGTON, DC 
Dr. Boushey. Thank you, Vice Chair Maloney and Chairman 
Lee, for inviting me to speak today. It is an honor to be here. 
My name is Heather Boushey, and I am president and CEO of 
the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. We seek to advance 
evidence-backed  ideas  and  policies  in  pursuit  of  growth  that  is 
strong, stable, and broadly shared. 
One of the most important things we can do to fight inequality 
in the United States right now is to start keeping track of it. Gov-
ernment statistics drive economic policymaking in Congress, the 
Federal Reserve, and the executive agencies. Inequality should be 
added to this pantheon. 
And the right way to incorporate inequality is to add measures 
of  growth  within  income  quantiles  to  the  National  Income  and 
Product Accounts. This extension to our existing National Income 
Accounts updates them to better reflect the realities of the 21st 
century economy. 
Vice Chair Maloney has introduced a bill that would do just that, 
and I want to thank her for her attention to this important issue. 
The bill is called the Measuring Real Income Growth Act, and it 
will tell us what growth looks like for low-, middle-, and high-in-
come Americans. The one number approach to growth we use now 
is no longer sufficient.

In the 1960s and 1970s, growth in our economy was broad-based. 
When the economy grew, most families saw their incomes rise in 
tandem.  But  that  pattern  fell  apart  starting  sometime  around 
1980. Over the past 40 years, most growth has gone to a small 
group of people, those at the top of the income distribution. 
When  growth  is  so  unequally  distributed,  aggregate  measures 
are misleading. Distributional measures of growth answer an in-
creasingly  important  question:  Who  prospers  when  the  economy 
grows? Measuring growth for Americans up and down the income 
ladder will have profound impacts on economic discourse and on 
policymaking. 
First, it will connect the idea of aggregate economic data with 
the  real-life  circumstances  of  families  in  the  economy.  When  a 
worker sees politicians touting strong growth but looks around and 
sees no evidence of that in their community, they are right to feel 
that they are being left behind. 
Second, distributional accounts will focus our attention on the 
economic well-being of families, which is, after all, what growth is 
supposed to deliver. 
Third, distributional measures of growth will guide policymakers 
in designing policies that both raise output and do it in a way that 
everyone gains. 
Finally, these metrics will allow citizens to hold their elected rep-
resentatives accountable to delivering an economy that works for 
all. 
Now is the time for the Bureau of Economic Analysis to incor-
porate distributional measures into our regularly released national 
accounts. The statistical science around this topic is increasingly 
mature. In addition to work by academics, the OECD has created 
an expert group to study a new standard for distributional meas-
ures  of  income.  Some  member  countries  have  already  adopted 
versions of these measures in their official statistics. 
Here in the United States, the Federal Reserve has started re-
porting a distributional breakdown of the financial accounts. Criti-
cally, these measurements fill in a significant gap in our under-
standing of the U.S. economy. For decades, our economic policy has 
been driven by the presumption that we must increase growth at 
all costs. 
Proponents of this view argue that, quote, ‘‘growing the pie is the 
most  important  metric  of  success.’’  This  presumption  is  wrong. 
There is a large and growing body of empirical research that shows 
that  we  cannot  create  strong  or  broadly  shared  economic  gains 
through a policy agenda that allows those at the top to reap the 
bulk of the gains. 
First, research shows that inequality obstructs the development 
of human capital. Children from low-income families have worse 
health outcomes and fewer educational opportunities, which has 
long-run effects on productivity and output. 
Second, research shows that inequality is subverting the proper 
function of the institutions that manage the market. A small num-
ber of citizens with immense wealth exercise outsized influence on 
policy entrenching their wealth by lowering taxes and weakening 
protections on labor.

Third, inequality distorts both consumption and investment. Re-
search confirms the intuition that the rich save more of their in-
come. Rising income inequality puts more money in the hands of 
the rich and depresses overall economic demand, while simulta-
neously encouraging a greater reliance on credit rather than pro-
ductive investment. 
Because rising inequality obstructs, subverts, and distorts our 
economy, we cannot be indifferent to how growth is distributed. 
The new measurements proposed by Vice Chair Maloney will help 
us  chart  a  path  to  stable,  broad-based  growth  that  benefits  all 
Americans. 
I look forward to your questions. Thank you.

sions for the Record on page 42.] 
Vice Chair Maloney. Dr. Holtz-Eakin. 
STATEMENT OF DR. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, PRESIDENT, 
AMERICAN ACTION FORUM, WASHINGTON, DC 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Vice Chair Maloney, Chairman Lee, members 
of the committee, thank you for the privilege of being here today 
to discuss this important research area and the policy implications 
of it. 
We are all by now quite familiar with the characterization of in-
come inequality and its  evolution over  the past four decades, a 
characterization that includes the share going to the top 1 percent 
rising from roughly 10 to 20 percent and incomes for those in the 
bottom half of the distribution remaining essentially flat. 
So as someone who is a consumer of this research literature as 
much  as  anyone,  it  is  disconcerting  to  read  recent  research  by 
Gerry Auten and David Splinter that reexamines these patterns 
and finds, in fact, at the top, the rise was quite modest, perhaps 
2 percent, and that in the bottom 50 percent, the income increased 
by about a third over that period. And that is a very different pic-
ture of the level and evolution of inequality in the United States. 
It is clear there is no consensus. And if you dig into this, it turns 
out that the results that you get are incredibly sensitive to the 
kinds of things that neither you nor I would know how to make a 
decision on. What is going to be the basic unit of observation? Are 
we going to look at households? Are we going to look at tax filing 
units? What is going to be the definition of income? What will be 
in it? Will we try to scale to get all national income or not? How 
do we impute the things that we don’t actually directly observe? 
And it is quite striking how sensitive the results are to different 
choices of the measure of inflation over that time period. It makes 
a big difference for the results. 
And so I think it is fair to say, at this point, there is no real con-
sensus about the level or evolution of income inequality, and that 
this is an ongoing and active area of research that, hopefully, some 
agreement will be reached by the various researchers. 
It does for me, at least, raise the question of how we want to 
think about the policy implications of the research. If we really 
don’t know where we are, it is hard to figure out exactly what the 
policy design would be. And on top of that, it is not obvious what

the goal is. What is the right level of inequality? And how would 
you actually identify it and institute policies to get to it? 
Surely, we are not trying to get to zero where everyone gets ex-
actly the same thing. So that we have to stop somewhere in be-
tween. And I have yet to see anyone articulate a stopping point in 
a way for us to think about the objectives of this—of this policy. 
And so if you don’t know where you are starting, you don’t know 
where you are going, it is not much of a situation where you want 
to take aggressive policy action. 
The final thing I would emphasize that comes out quite clearly 
in this is, while there is casual talk of the top 1 percent or the mid-
dle income or the lower income, as if they were monolithic entities, 
there is a huge amount of movement in and out of those. 
In research that Gerry Auten did, you find that something be-
tween 37 and 47 percent of those people in the 1 percent are gone 
a year later. So being a 1 percenter might be a one-time lifetime 
event. You sell a business, you are a 1 percenter. You weren’t be-
fore, you never will be again. And how we think about policies to-
ward any part of that income distribution, we should think hard 
about whether people are going to be there for any sustained period 
of time. It makes a difference in the policy design. 
So when I look at this literature and I recognize the sort of deep 
caring that has always been true in the United States about in-
equality, it leads me to the modest suggestion that perhaps the 
right thing to do until the research is settled is to focus on the 
piece of inequality about which we all agree, the lower tail, those 
people who are poor in America, have been poor, may remain poor. 
There, I think, is consensus that we ought to do something about 
that wherever possible and spend a little less time fighting about 
policies toward the rich and spend a lot more time thinking about 
strategies to reduce the level of poverty in the United States on a 
permanent basis. 
Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.

Dr. Zwick. Vice Chair Maloney, thanks to you, Chairman Lee, 
members of the committee, for the opportunity to appear today to 
discuss my research and lessons for measuring economic inequality. 
My name is Eric Zwick. I am an associate professor of finance 
at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. 
I make three points in my testimony that I will summarize here. 
First, inequality is high and has risen. A meaningful scientific con-
sensus supports this basic point. However, the academic commu-
nity is still debating the size of this increase and learning about 
the  composition  of  high-end  inequality.  For  example,  relative  to 
what we previously thought, households at the top of the income 
distribution derive more of their income from work and from entre-

preneurship and less from investment income like dividends and 
interest. 
Most top earners are private business owners, a group that in-
cludes  lawyers,  doctors,  consultants,  owners  of  mid-sized  busi-
nesses, such as auto dealers and wholesale distributors. In both 
number and aggregate income, these groups far surpass that of 
high-tech billionaires and public company CEOs who have been the 
focus of much inequality commentary. 
In an early stage paper, I have found that wealth concentration 
has risen, but risen less, and depends more on private business 
ownership than previously thought. I do want to stress that our re-
sults do not imply that wealth concentration is low or irrelevant 
from a policymaker’s perspective. 
Second, my second point, is that measuring broad inequality does 
require assumptions based on evolving data collection and meth-
ods. Therefore, conclusions from the research frontier are some-
what uncertain. The state-of-the-art on implementing distributional 
national accounts, or DINAs, which would provide statistics like 
GDP but broken out by income groups, remains a work in progress. 
The core issue is that DINA methods require many assumptions. 
The ultimate conclusions are sensitive to which assumptions we 
make. 
When data are missing on who gets what type of income, re-
searchers make certain assumptions to fill in the gaps. For exam-
ple, in the leading prototype of DINAs for the United States, there 
is a strong link between Saez and Zucman’s—and Dr. Zucman’s 
wealth  estimates,  Piketty,  Saez,  and  Zucman’s  DINA  estimates, 
and Saez and Zucman’s recent work on tax progressivity. If we 
change the assumptions for estimated wealth inequality, that will 
change  distributional  income  estimates,  and  changing  distribu-
tional income estimates will change estimates of average tax rates 
at the top and bottom. 
In my view, these assumptions are, in most cases, well justified, 
but they necessarily rely on incomplete data and convenient sim-
plification. Thus, alternative assumptions can be equally, and in 
some cases better justified, with significant implications for what 
stories we tell about how inequality has evolved and what lessons 
we draw for tax policy. 
It is also important to recall that what we observe in tax data 
is  influenced  by  reporting  responses  to  changing  tax  rules  over 
time. So the same high-level statistics might be consistent with 
very different underlying stories of what is going on. This uncer-
tainty is where the scholarship plays its role. 
So third, my third point is that I recommend several clear next 
steps for collecting new data to help implement DINAs and im-
prove inequality measures. 
First, task the Bureau of Economic Analysis with developing a 
process to produce DINA estimates, to prepare a public technical 
report, and open up findings and methodological details to expert 
feedback. A recent effort by economists at the Federal Reserve to 
distribute the U.S. Financial Accounts demonstrates the value of 
such a process.

Second, new tax laws that require partnerships and C corpora-
tions to trace and report their ultimate owners could help improve 
our DINA estimates. 
Third, expanding the IRS’ random audit program could improve 
our understanding of underreported income and help improve our 
DINA estimates. 
And last, improving data collection and retirement account bal-
ances and the portfolio composition could improve our DINA esti-
mates, because that data is currently not used. 
The academic literature remains somewhat divided on the tech-
nical specifics of distributional accounts. But these divisions largely 
reflect an evolving state of current knowledge that is changing as 
new data becomes available. This is not unusual in academic re-
search; the glass is half full. I strongly believe that we will rec-
oncile these differences and continue to build toward a consensus 
method over time. 
Some final remarks. To advance our learning, I think this com-
mittee could facilitate a substantive conversation about several out-
standing questions. For example, what roles have population aging, 
changes in the pension system played in measuring these trends; 
second,  how  important  is  multigenerational  wealth  versus  self- 
made wealth; third, what are the consequences of inequality for 
disparities in opportunity, especially for children. 
Let me also say that I greatly admire Dr. Zucman’s work and 
that of his colleagues, Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, de-
spite our occasional friendly disagreements over accounting meth-
ods. I have learned a lot from them, and my work would not have 
been possible without theirs. 
And last, I want to reiterate my reading of the evidence. It is not 
that inequality in America is low or that it has not increased at 
all. Rather, my reading is that the increase has been more modest, 
the nature of the increase skews away from the passive capital 
highlighted in Piketty’s book and toward human capital, labor, and 
entrepreneurial activity. 
Thank you for your time. Look forward to questions. 
[The prepared statement of Dr. Zwick appears in the Submis-
sions for the Record on page 61.] 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you. 
I am calling first on Senator Heinrich. He has got a conflict. He 
has got a challenge with his time. 
Senator Heinrich. Well, I will keep this short, in respect of all 
of my colleagues’ time. 
Dr. Boushey, I just wanted to ask how important it would be to 
make sure that, as we implement these new statistics, that they 
actually be produced concurrently with when other statistics are 
produced. So, for example, most economic statistics come out quar-
terly. If we want to understand the relationships, how important 
is it to be on sort of the same calendar as everything else that we 
rely on when we try to manage the economy? 
Dr. Boushey. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. It is a really im-
portant question. You know, currently we release data on—from 
the National Income and Product Accounts on GDP, gross domestic 
product, quarterly. And I think it would be very important that, as 
the BEA puts together this methodology, that the goal be for the

distributional data to be released alongside the GDP. It is through 
doing that that we will learn how growth is distributed. 
I think actually what has happened at the Federal Reserve with 
their distributional accounts on the financial side shows that that 
is possible. That is what they have done. They have taken the Na-
tion’s financial accounts and they have appended them to survey 
data and are able to make extrapolations that allow that data to 
be released on a quarterly basis, which has just started this fall. 
So I think that shows a good roadmap for how BEA could do it. 
And I think it is not just possible, but it is imperative for the pol-
icy debate that, as we get that quarterly GDP, we understand who 
in America is benefiting, where it is happening. Ideally, I would 
like to be able to see that across place and ideally across race and 
to some extent gender, but probably that is a little bit more com-
plicated. But I think that having people understand who growth is 
benefiting in that timely way is probably one of the most impera-
tive new statistics that we need from Federal agencies. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you. 
Chairman Lee is recognized. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you very much, Madam Vice Chair. And 
thanks to all of you for being here. 
Dr. Zwick, we are going to start with you, if that is all right. You 
have written that the data for different types of income are often 
sensitive to the types of tax regime that is at issue. Do I under-
stand that correctly? And if a particular type of income receives fa-
vorable tax treatment, some income may be relabeled to take ad-
vantage of that treatment. In other words, you squish one end of 
the balloon, air is going to go somewhere else in that balloon. 
Does this suggest that we should be careful interpreting esti-
mates of income inequality or taxes paid in the year immediately 
following a major tax reform package? For example, a year like 
1987 or like 2018. And what is the most recent year for which you 
feel that we have sufficiently high quality and reliable data? 
Dr. Zwick. Yes. So thanks for the question. I think, yeah, the 
basic point is that if there is a different tax rate for types of in-
come—I think we see this especially in entrepreneurial situations, 
where you have the ability to pay yourself either as labor or capital 
dependent and, you know, subject to the tax rules, of course. We 
have seen responses to tax regimes that include this relabeling re-
sponse. And so the income that is reported as capital, for example, 
might actually reflect labor income sort of under the hood, if you 
actually thought about the economic nature. And we use a bunch 
of methods to try and estimate the extent to which capital income 
as reported actually reflects labor using, say, when an owner pre-
maturely dies in a small business or an owner prematurely retires, 
thinking about how the business reacts to that. If it were just pas-
sive capital, the business would continue operating. But if it were 
more a mix of capital and labor, the business would change. 
So those kinds of issues show up—they are always present. And 
to the extent that there are different tax rates on different kinds 
of income, those issues can be larger. So as we move, you know, 
capital tax rates relative to labor tax rates, those issues can be 
larger.

So, you know, over time we have had different tax changes. And 
come right around these reforms, the specific behavior labeling re-
sponse is uncertain. 
Chairman Lee. Do we have a complete and reliable dataset yet 
for 2018, the first year following the—— 
Dr. Zwick. I don’t think so. 
Chairman Lee. Dr. Zucman, in your New York Times op-ed, you 
have consumption taxes at 12.3 percent of income for the lowest in-
come group. And yet, to my knowledge, no state has sales taxes 
higher than around 9 percent. And many states, of course, have 
carve-outs designed to make the sales tax less regressive by carv-
ing out things like unprepared food. 
Your methods state that this is because they pay sales tax on 
goods purchased with transfer income. Is that correct? Am I stating 
that correctly? In other words, that the difference between the fact 
that no state has sales taxes higher than 9 percent and your figure 
of 12.3 percent is made up for as a result of the fact that you figure 
that  some  of  these  transfer  programs  involve  people  paying  for 
things using money that they get through one of the programs. Is 
that right? 
Dr. Zucman. So what we try to do in this book is very much 
what we try to do in this overall project of distributional national 
accounts, which is allocate the aggregate amount of tax revenue 
collected by the U.S. Just like we want to allocate total GDP. Total 
consumption taxes are broader than sales taxes, they include excise 
taxes or other indirect taxes. So that is a main explanation for the 
numbers that you mentioned. 
And what I want to say is that—— 
Chairman Lee. Federal excise taxes aren’t made up for in that 
difference between 9 percent and 12.3 percent, are they? 
Dr. Zucman. Yes—no—— 
Chairman Lee. You maintain that they are? 
Dr. Zucman. State sales taxes are only a fraction of total con-
sumption taxes in the U.S. You have Federal excise taxes. You 
have tariffs. You have other indirect taxes, such as business li-
censes. 
So what I want to say is, ultimately, I think it would be helpful 
also for the government to publish statistics of effective tax rates 
by income that are comprehensive, that take into account 100 per-
cent of the official amount of tax revenue collected by the U.S. We 
try to provide a prototype of this. We are the first ones to distribute 
100 percent of the total amount of tax revenue, 28 percent of na-
tional income. This is work in progress. These are methods that 
can be improved and that, hopefully, will be improved and taken 
over by government statisticians in the future. 
Chairman Lee. But do I have this right, though, that if some 
government  transfer  program  expanded,  the  program  itself  ex-
panded and poor people who benefited under that program, who re-
ceived money under that program, were able to buy more things as 
a result of that expansion, that would show up in your estimates 
as higher tax rates for poor people, because they would pay more 
sales tax, but they would not be credited with having more income? 
Am I understanding that correctly?

Dr. Zucman. This is an interesting methodological question, Mr. 
Chairman. And we took that into account by restricting the popu-
lation to people who earn more than half the Federal minimum 
wage in income. So, typically, these are people who might receive 
some transfer income. That is not playing a big role in the specific 
statistics. So we have thought hard about this question—— 
Chairman Lee. But the answer is yes, right? The answer is yes, 
isn’t it? 
Dr. Zucman. The answer is yes, but quantitatively this is very 
minor. 
Chairman Lee. Understood. 
Dr. Zucman. Qualitatively you are correct. 
Chairman Lee. My time has expired. Thank you, Madam Vice 
Chair. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you. I would like to ask each of the 
witnesses, what level of confidence do you have in evidence that in-
equality is rising? 
We are all here today because shared prosperity matters to the 
American people. GDP is the commonly used indicator to measure 
the growth of the economy, but it doesn’t tell us how the growth 
is shared across the economy. We often have to wait years for re-
searchers to get the data and report on key trends. 
So I would like to ask each of you, do you agree that having more 
detailed data produced by the Federal Government and shared on 
a regular basis on who is benefiting from economic growth will 
allow us to better evaluate the impact of policies? 
And I’d like to start with you, Dr. Zucman, and let’s just have 
everyone’s thought on it. 
Thank you. 
Dr. Zucman. Thank you very much for your question. As our 
discussion showed, there is a great demand in society for statistics 
that decompose GDP, National Income, other macroeconomic aggre-
gates by income groups. And there would be a huge value in pub-
lishing those statistics. 
The way that I see this process unfolding is very much like what 
happens—what happened with the national accounts in the first 
place. You know, the national accounts were developed by econo-
mists such as Simon Kuznets in the 1930s in the U.S. And then 
they were taken over by official government statisticians and gov-
ernment agencies. And ever since, they are refined and improved 
year after year. And I think that is the path forward, and we hope 
to contribute to that process. That is how to build trust in these 
all-important statistics. 
Dr. Boushey. Thank you. 
I think it is very important that we have more detailed data on 
how growth is being distributed. One of the things that we see 
when we look at the way that policy is discussed, the way that the 
economy is talked about, we get data regularly on the aggregate 
economic output through GDP and other measures. But what we— 
we only get data irregularly, only once a year, on income inequal-
ity. And I think it is very important that we put those two con-
versations together. 
Because we used to be a country in the sixties and seventies 
where, when GDP grew, most Americans saw their incomes grow

at the same rate. Since 1980, it is only for people in the top 10 per-
cent of the income distribution that see their incomes grow at least 
at the average of GDP, if not above. So most people are not experi-
encing  that  average  growth.  Yet  we  are  going  out—the  Federal 
Government is going out every quarter and saying the economy 
grew by 3.3 percent or the economy grew by 2 percent, when the 
vast majority of families are experiencing growth in their income, 
which is far below that. 
I think we have a responsibility to connect those dots, and we 
have the tools and the prototype and the skills within the inside 
of the Bureau of Economic Analysis to make this real. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I certainly think if you want to have solid poli-
cies, you ought to measure better. I don’t think that that should 
be an objectionable goal. 
We do get annual reports on inequality and on income growth. 
And they point out, quite vividly sometimes, the difference between 
the top line and what is going on. 
So in 2016, families who worked full time for the full year saw 
exactly zero increase in their real incomes. That is Census data. 
Nevertheless, we didn’t have zero macroeconomic growth. And so 
we don’t reconcile those in a deep way statistically. So I think we 
should not object to the fact that we need to understand this better, 
measure it better. 
And the thing that I would just repeat from my opening remarks 
is, it is important not to pretend that people are somehow stuck in 
a particular place. They are moving around a lot, and measuring 
that mobility would be comparably important, in my view. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Dr. Zwick. 
Dr. Zwick. Yeah, I think I generally—I mean, I am an empirical 
researcher, so I am always going to be supportive of more high- 
quality data. So I think this is a case where not only the empirical 
researchers, but I think a much broader community would really 
value this product. I think what we know about whether inequality 
is rising is—you know, we learn with a considerable lag currently. 
So I can say that the scientific consensus is that it has risen, but 
what is going on right now is much harder to say. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you very much. My time is ex-
pired. 
I now call on Representative Schweikert, to be followed by Rep-
resentative Beyer. 
Representative  Schweikert.  Mr.  Chairman,  Madam  Vice 
Chair. 
Okay. This is like a kid in a candy store for some of us, which

Three of you, I have actually read a number of your things. Can 
I throw out first a couple of concepts? I am going to read some-
thing, and then let’s do a couple of quick questions. 
I will argue in many ways the fixation, particularly on some of 
the tax reporting data from both our country and around the world, 
and the—I have a fixation on income inequality. But I believe you 
are missing a whole bunch of the way you would properly model 
it, everything from if you actually do proper overlays of where we 
are demographically. Some of the unusual things we have seen in

the data of millennial males underperforming in the labor force 
participation, the fixation on what wealthy have compared to the 
thing I wish—Doctor, I know you have done some of this—velocity. 
What is my movement from someone being—and can I use the lan-
guage quartiles? Just because when I was in school, that is what 
we called it and no one else here on the panel did that. So I don’t 
want to be—I am so fearful of being offensive to anyone. 
But, you know, when we would talk about the two or three lower 
quartiles, we had a fixation of what was healthy in an economy 
was our brothers and sisters moving up and out of some of those 
lower quartiles. And a fixation by distribution difference is actually 
in many ways dishonest, because if my vast portion of my popu-
lation, you know, my brothers and sisters who didn’t graduate high 
school, and all of a sudden I see amazing movement, particularly 
in the last year, two years. 
So, look, I am looking at some data right here. Real median earn-
ings for female households with no spouse present jumped 7.6 per-
cent last year. We should be giddy about those sorts of numbers. 
But the data you provide us, the data that are modeling, should be 
talking to us as policymakers of how do we do more of that. 
I mean, if I came to you and said a 7.6 movement in a time of 
almost no inflation in a quartile that had a brutal previous decade, 
we should be joyful and we should be figuring out how to do more 
of it. 
And my fear is the partisan rage that often here, as we are try-
ing to make arguments on income distribution, instead of there are 
things that are stunning numbers. They are preliminary. And, you 
know, we have a couple authors out there in your field that are 
saying the last year may be the very first year in modern times 
where  income  inequality  either  was  flat  or  shrunk  because  our 
lower  quartiles,  particularly  the  lower  three,  had  such  income 
movement.  It  is  not  done  yet.  Maybe  I  am  being  pathologically 
hopeful. 
And, Dr. Holtz-Eakin, I consider you a friend, because you tol-
erate some of my eccentricities. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. And I consider you pathologically hopeful. 
Representative  Schweikert.  Yeah,  that  too.  Look,  I  am  57 
with a four year-old. 
That should have been funnier for the room. 
What do we do to understand the uniqueness of right now where 
all my economic studies—I have been on Joint Economic since I got 
here—from just a couple of years ago said the types of numbers I 
have seen in the last year were impossible, moving back well over 
63 percent labor force participation was impossible. 
How  do  I  understand—knowing  the  data,  knowing  the—it  is 
great. How do I understand what has worked? 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Measure it. I mean, honestly, the—for those of 
us who care about the evolution of the economy, we are always 
really reading economic history. At best, we are getting data which 
are last month’s; usually, they are older than that. We are guessing 
about what is going on right now. We never really know. 
And for me to give you—I think it is kind of a scientific answer 
to what is different in 2018–2019 in terms of labor market perform-

ance, we are going to have to measure better. We have lots of sus-
picions about it, but we don’t know for sure. And that is the reality. 
Representative Schweikert. Do you all consider it statistically 
very significant that in a single year, a half point drop in the pov-
erty rate in a single year? 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Yes. 
Representative Schweikert. So, A, you know, from the polit-
ical world, we should be joyful. But, B, how do we find out datawise 
what was working, what drove that? 
Because I know in our modern politics, we fixate on the wealthy 
and say, look, what they have you don’t have. But if we are going 
to be actually great for our society, we should be fixating what our 
brothers and sisters in those lower quartiles have and how we get 
them to have more. 
Dr. Zwick. I think including, you know, the kind of characteris-
tics like you described, like more fixed characteristics and seeing 
what happens to those people from year to year, the data are avail-
able in the distributional accounts. 
Representative Schweikert. Well, in the last—because we also 
have the problem in the Joint Economic world where we are seeing 
here is Census data, here is BLS data, here is—and as we know, 
tax data has stunning amounts of noise in it. And then trying to 
normalize that and then trying to put all of what is happening in 
our State and local and trying to normalize each jurisdiction and 
their effects, it would be fascinating and you will spend a lifetime 
just doing adjustments. And you know when you do that many ad-
justments, your final outcome, the variance, is unacceptable. 
So, with that, I yield back, Madam Vice Chair. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Mr. Beyer. 
Representative  Beyer.  Thank  you,  Madam  Vice  Chair.  And 
thank y’all very much for coming and being a part of this. First 
time we have ever had a panel with two people whose names begin 
with Z. This is really—— 
Representative Schweikert. And they are bookends. 
Chairman Lee. And both doctors. 
Representative Beyer. Exactly. All doctors. 
You know, when the Tax Cut and Jobs Acts of 2017 was signed, 
I feared it would result in a significant redistribution of wealth to-
wards  the  richest  among  us.  But  I  was  really  struck  by  Dr. 
Zucman’s figure published a lot last week that after the law went 
into effect, the 400 richest households now shoulder a lower overall 
tax burden, 23 percent, than the entire bottom 50 percent, which 
is 24 percent. It is the first time in a hundred years this has been 
true. So this is very relevant that you are here. 
Dr. Zwick, I struggled through all 800 pages of Thomas Piketty’s 
book. And the main takeaway I had from it was that the return 
on capital is much greater than the return on labor. And yet you 
talk about that in your research, you found the top inequality is 
more human capital intensive. And it seems like you basically—the 
cut is that you look at passthrough income as more on the wealth 
side rather than the income side, whereas as a car dealer, whom 
you refer to in here, I note that it is often run very much on the 
labor side.

Can you talk about your differences with Piketty on his central 
conclusion? 
Dr. Zwick. Sure. And I will be very brief. But thank you so 
much for the question, Congressman. 
The difference is basically about using—the difference between 
using aggregate statistics, the aggregate flows, you can compute in 
the interest rate. You can get—you can compare it to these aggre-
gate returns on labor might tell one story. And what we do is use 
sort of microdata, so it is kind of from the bottom up trying to ask, 
of the top 1 percent, what share of them is in different industries, 
how big are their firms? How many firms do they own? Basic de-
scriptive statistics that you don’t need a Ph.D. to understand. 
And what we find is that—and it was surprising to us when we 
looked underneath, it was not what we were expecting. There are 
just a ton of doctors, there are a ton of dentists, there are auto 
dealers. There is like sort of a much broader, richer view of the 
economy than what you see if you read the newspaper. You know, 
all the journalists live in New York. There is a lot of finance in the 
newspaper. But it is a much broader economy. And that includes 
at the very top of the income distribution. 
Representative Beyer. Okay, great. Thank you very much. 
Dr. Zucman, one of the criticisms people are throwing back about 
your research, which I very much appreciate—the research, not the 
criticism—is that they leave out all the transfer payments. You 
know, the earned income tax credit and food stamps. 
And how do you—is that valid? And would the—would the in-
come inequality not be nearly as great if you included the things 
that are not part of that AGI? 
Dr. Zucman. Thank you very much, Congressman, for this very 
important question. 
So we do look at all taxes and also all government spending. In 
our prototype distributional national accounts, we care about both, 
because we want to study what is the overall distributive effect of 
government intervention in the economy. 
So we have two sets of statistics. We have statistics on income 
distribution before taxes and transfers, and we have statistics on 
income  distribution  when  you  measure  income  after  taxes  and 
transfers. And in both cases, adding up to 100 percent of national 
income or 100 percent of GDP. 
And when you do that, what you see is that there is less inequal-
ity after taxes and transfers. So, you know, the overall tax and 
transfer system is redistributive, and that is very important. 
But we also find that the rise in inequality is almost the same 
after taxes and transfers as compared to before taxes and transfers. 
In both cases, you had a big increase in income concentration. 
Representative Beyer. Okay. Thank you very much. 
Dr. Boushey, you—I have three millennial daughters, and they 
are very much affected by this income inequality, at least until 
they inherit the car dealer’s money. 
From a policy standpoint, how do we address the millennials? 
Dr. Boushey. Oh, what a great question. You know, I mean, so 
what we are here to talk about today is how we measure economic 
progress. We know that the younger generations, from a lot of dif-
ferent datasets, are struggling in this economy. There are a lot of

different ways that the concentration of wealth and income is mak-
ing it harder for them to get their footing, to move their way up, 
if they are not lucky enough to have a parent that is, you know, 
bequeathing them a small business or the like. 
So I think starting by figuring out how we can increase oppor-
tunity, remove the obstructions to opportunity, especially for kids, 
those millennials that are at the lower end of the income distribu-
tion. Personally, some of my favorites include things like thinking 
about how we are going to deal with education, especially early 
childhood education? How we are going to ensure that there are 
good jobs for them? Will they have the right to join a union? Will 
they have the right to have a job that has access to benefits like 
healthcare or paid family medical leave? Those are some of the 
places I would focus. But those really hinge on making sure that 
we address the concentration of wealth and particularly market 
concentration. 
Many  of  those  millennials  are  looking  at  labor  markets  that 
what—economists are  so  great with our  words—but are  monop-
sony—monopsony labor markets, meaning that they don’t have a 
lot of options where to work. And I think thinking about that side 
of the economy, we haven’t done enough of. So I would start by fo-
cusing there. 
Representative Beyer. Okay, great. Thank you very much. 
Madam Vice Chair, I yield back. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you. 
Representative Joyce Beatty. 
Representative Beatty. Thank you, Madam Vice Chair. And 
thank you to all of our scholarly witnesses here. 
Let me start by saying I am overwhelmed. I am just simply over-
whelmed. And here is where I want to go with this. You know, this 
is like the new thing. You know, and for me coming to Congress 
when President Barack Obama was in office, he made statements 
that he observed that inequality was the defining issue of our time. 
Well, that has continued. Whether I am talking about the Congres-
sional Black Caucus forums, when we do our scholarly work, it is 
the same titles that we have here. It is wealth creation, it is in-
equality, it is the gap, it is how we bring it through. 
Now, I am not going to say that I have read, but I have muddled 
through all of your scholarly work here. And I am having a hard 
time separating inequality and poverty, because I think they have 
an effect on each other directly and indirectly through their link 
with economic growth. 
But when I read this, and then I get resolved from you, making 
statements like there is no consensus in the research or the lit-
erature, bottom line, that will give us an answer. So I am here for 
some answers. 
I have read the theories. I read again—you will say, given these 
challenges to the policies, there is no scientific research that tells 
us. 
When I go home to the 3rd Congressional District, where I rep-
resent the wealthiest and the poorest, the number one thing that 
I get beaten up on is this topic here today, Madam Vice Chair. And 
they want answers.

So when I think of the question of I want to pose to you—and 
I will start with you, the female, Ms. Boushey—Dr. Boushey. This 
past July, you authored an article entitled, ‘‘Neither history nor re-
search supports the supply-side of economics.’’ In it you stated that 
the Reagan tax cuts did not pay for themselves and they ushered 
in a period of broad economic inequality. I am with you. A substan-
tially similar phenomenon occurred with the Bush tax cuts. 
Well, we already know that the Republican tax cuts passed in 
Congress  will  not  pay  for  themselves.  I  think  mostly  everyone 
agrees that it was a myth. 
But how do you think this will affect the income equality? Is the 
Tax Code the primary driver of this income inequality or what? 
Because I have to go back and tell people. They will say, how do 
you fix me? You know, we have got the Census data. And I agree 
with my colleague over there. I remember the quartiles and how 
growth—— 
But is there a real bottom line answer that I go back—when peo-
ple say, you serve on this powerful committee. What did the ex-
perts tell you of how we resolve this? 
Dr. Boushey. Well, let me—a couple of answers. First, I think 
that the people in your community, I would bet, would be really 
gratified to know that what their experience is in the economy was 
reflected in how we talked about economic progress. And that is the 
kind of data that we have been talking about, that we want the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis to do. 
So no longer would we just say the economy grew at 3.3 percent, 
but we would be able to say, in the average it grew by 3.3 percent, 
but for most people in the bottom quartile, growth was only 1 per-
cent or growth was 5 percent, whatever that number is. 
Representative Beatty. How do we get to increase this growth? 
Dr. Boushey. So yes. So the first thing, though, is I think giving 
people the power of the data, really important. But then—— 
Representative  Beatty.  I  don’t  think  the  poor  people—poor 
people don’t—this is inside baseball. No offense to you. This is in-
side baseball. 
When you go out—it is not people like us that are asking the 
question. You go into a room with a thousand people, and what 
they are saying to me, how do we—they are the factors on the 
other end of that. So this works for us, because this is intellectual 
dialogue. 
But are there any answers—do we need higher paid jobs? You 
know,  we  have  got  disparities  and  discrimination.  We  have  got 
women who don’t make the same amount as their male counter-
parts. We have got—where is all of that in this for resolve? And 
anyone can answer that. 
One of the guys, jump in, somebody, because I only have 30 sec-
onds. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. As I said in the outset, I think it is appro-
priate, given all the uncertainty about what  is  going on at the 
upper end of distribution, to focus on the bottom end. Focus on poor 
people. 
Representative Beatty. Okay. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. And we know that there are things that really 
need to be done there. Education is a big problem, including early

childhood education, where the evidence is there are very high re-
turns. 
Representative Beatty. Okay. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. So, you know, start with getting Americans 
prepared to enter the labor force and compete effectively. Do that 
and the rest of their future will be brighter. 
And, you know, there is a big difference between inequality ris-
ing because people got poor and inequality rising because everyone 
stayed the same and the rich got richer. Let’s worry about when 
people are poor. That should be a focus. 
Representative Beatty. Okay. Thank you. And my time is up. 
But thank you very much. 
Vice Chair Maloney. And Denny Heck, Representative Heck. 
Representative  Heck.  Thank  you,  Madam  Vice  Chair.  And 
thank you for holding a hearing on such an incredibly important 
subject. 
In addition to the other factors that my colleague mentioned, we 
have also got the Federal Reserve. And it is pretty—Heather knows 
exactly where I am going on this. 
It is pretty clear that over the last 25 years, the Fed, in a well- 
intended effort to anticipate an overheating of the economy, has 
tapped the brakes before we reached full employment. We know 
this to be the case, because they rarely reach their inflation target. 
They are almost always below it. 
And as a consequence, inarguably, especially low-skilled or low- 
income workers, are having a harder time receiving wage growth. 
And that is not an insignificant part of the overall suppression of 
the wage growth over the last 30 years. 
So I guess my first question is, have any of you studied, in par-
ticular, the impact on wage growth for—as a consequence of the 
Fed’s policy? No, not their policy, I would suggest, because they are 
not achieving their policy. Their practice. Have any of you studied 
the impact on wage growth of Federal policy? 
Dr. Boushey first, if you don’t mind, sir, because she is from 
Washington State. 
Dr. Boushey. I have got the home court advantage here. I am 
not from Olympia, though. 
I mean, I think that—I am so glad you asked about the Fed. And 
I think it is connected with the Congresswoman’s question about 
what we can do to help families all across the United States. 
You know, the Fed has a mandate to keep employment high and 
inflation low. And, of course, we think there is a tradeoff there. 
What we are seeing right now is that we have very low unemploy-
ment, and yet that hasn’t led to the kinds of wage increases that 
we would have expected. If you would have told us a decade ago, 
oh, you would have seen unemployment this low for—— 
Representative Heck. Let me stop you. 
Dr. Boushey. Yeah. 
Representative Heck. Are you going to argue that the Phillips 
curve is broken? Because we don’t have enough—we don’t have 
enough time for that argument. Because the truth is, Dr. Boushey, 
we are still adding jobs into the labor market at a rate in excess 
or at a number in excess of replacement. So we are clearly not at 
full employment yet.

Dr. Boushey. Right, exactly. And so the Fed needs to keep doing 
its job. But here’s the thing: I think what this moment shows us 
is that we need other policies around the Fed to ensure that com-
munities, that people in those communities see the wage increases 
that they should be seeing with low unemployment. 
So last time that we saw unemployment this low, we had com-
munities where more people were members of unions. So they had 
an  institution  where  they  could  bargain  for  higher  pay  without 
having to threaten to quit their job, right? You had less market 
concentration, because the—because we were enforcing—you know, 
especially in the sixties, we were enforcing antitrust differently, 
which gave workers more opportunities to be able to switch jobs 
and to raise their pay. 
So my point is that the Fed is incredibly important. But I am not 
letting you off the hook, because there are other parts of the policy 
that we need to—the policy environment that we need to do to 
make sure that we—— 
Representative Heck. Heather, I have never tried to wriggle 
off the hook. Let’s be real clear about that. 
But it seems to me the great unspoken part of this discussion is 
the Fed is not actually doing what their statutory charge is. And 
we don’t know what it would look like over the last 25 years, as 
they have continued to fight the last war, hyperinflation of the sev-
enties, in order to squeeze out that incredibly destructive impact on 
the economy. 
Dr. Boushey. But you are in a pickle—you are in a pickle now, 
Congressman, because we have interest rates that are very low, 
and the Fed does have all of these new tools that they have been 
using. 
Representative Heck. They raised them four times last year. 
Dr. Boushey. That they did, but they—— 
Representative Heck. And we were not at full employment and 
we are still not at full employment. Can we at least allow an exper-
iment in realizing what their statutory mandates are? 
Dr. Boushey. I a hundred percent agree with you. 
Representative Heck. Okay. I am not wiggling off the hook. I 
want to go to Dr.—— 
Dr. Boushey. I am 100 percent with you, but I just want to 
make sure that we take into account that they can’t—— 
Representative Heck. You have always made that abundantly 
clear, and it is gratefully received again today. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin, I actually have a follow-up question. 
Is there a better way to measure full employment? 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. No. 
Representative Heck. Well, that is depressing. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Yeah, it is. But here is what I would say. I 
agree with Heather on using lots of policies, not relying so much 
on the Fed. I mean, I think Europe is a testament to overreliance 
on monetary policy, a big problem. Right now, I think the Fed is 
actually quite cognizant of the sort of dilemma they face in achiev-
ing their mandate. 
Representative Heck. Let me stop you there.

Representative  Heck.  No,  let  me  stop  you  there,  because  I 
have got 18 seconds. 
Former Federal Reserve Chairs acknowledge this problem. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. But the current—— 
Representative Heck. Ben did it; Janet did it, after they left. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Sure, sure. I think to Chairman Powell’s cred-
it, I spent a day at the San Francisco Fed talking about the bene-
fits and costs of running a hot economy. They are thinking hard 
about when it is that they say stop. They know that the benefits 
of continuing the expansion disproportionately benefit those who 
are marginally taxed labor force, have the weakest skills, lowest 
education. 
Representative Heck. Let me—because I am over time. Be-
cause I do want to acknowledge that Chairman Powell has been 
more explicit in his acknowledgment of this need. And Chair Yellen 
was implicitly, while she was chair, more willing to acknowledge it 
and explicitly since she’s been—I think the trend line is good. But 
the fact is, under the current statutory construct, they didn’t do 
what they were asked to do for 25 years, and they could do that 
again. 
And with that, I yield back. Thank you, Madam Vice Chair. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you so much. 
And the Chair has requested a second round of questions. So we 
are going to do that for those who would like to. 
And I would like to ask Dr. Zucman, you have written exten-
sively on how the wealthy hold trillions in assets in offshore ac-
counts. As much as 8 percent of the global wealth is held in off-
shore havens. You estimate about $200 billion in global tax rev-
enue is lost each year. And how do these offshore havens affect es-
timates of inequality, and are we getting a complete picture? 
And also, any of the panelists, how does the U.S. experience com-
pare to that of other advanced economies over the last 30 to 40 
years? What is the trend internationally? What should we learn 
from other high-income countries on their efforts to track and re-
port on inequality? 
Starting with Dr. Zucman and anyone who wants to weigh in. 
Thank you. 
Dr. Zucman. Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Chair-
woman, for this question. 
Yes, in my work, I have estimated that about 8 percent of the 
world’s household financial wealth is held in tax havens globally. 
And this has implications for inequality, you know, that wealth and 
the income it generates, because it is not captured by GDP statis-
tics or national income statistics. So they are not even in the aggre-
gates and so they are not in our distributional national accounts. 
So it is possible and perhaps likely that we are actually under-
estimating the rise of income and wealth concentration for that 
reason. 
Now, I am working with colleagues, including colleagues at the 
IRS, to improve statistics, drawing on data that has become avail-
able in recent years, about Americans with offshore bank accounts 
and better measuring high-end tax evasion, in particular, its impli-
cation for inequality. So that is a very important field of research. 
And again, that is an area where the series will be improved, will

be revised, will have—we will always have better estimates in the 
future. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you. 
And does anyone want to comment on the U.S. experience com-
pared to other advanced economies over the past 30 to 40 years? 
Dr. Zwick. I will just say a couple of quick things. I think Dr. 
Zucman and his colleagues have done a lot of work studying other 
countries. And the issues I raised—back to Chairman Lee’s original 
question about the rules being quite important for what we meas-
ure in those series, in Europe where we have seen relatively low 
increases in inequality, in their reported series, there is also a lot 
of important closely held private business, retained earnings are 
not distributed necessarily. And so I think there is additional new 
research, looking at Scandinavia in Europe, that has raised again 
this  issue  that  like  measurement,  a  fully  distributional  account 
would be quite helpful. So that is one point I just wanted to raise. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I think there are two interesting things that 
we are thinking about. One is that the rising inequality over the 
past four decades is a global phenomenon. It is not unique to the 
United States. Labor markets have higher returns to skill across 
the globe. And, you know, it is important to think about that and 
think about the common factors. 
The  second  is—and  this  is  particularly  important  now  in  the 
aftermath of the 2017 Act, that reform moved the taxation of busi-
ness from global to territorial and changed the incentives to invest, 
innovate, and do it in the United States. 
Our developed country competitors have all done that, basically 
one a year for decades. And so in the data will be the implications 
for that reform on the way things get reported, including the more 
than half of business income that shows up on individual returns. 
And that is an important part of this debate. 
Vice  Chair  Maloney.  And,  Dr.  Boushey,  could  you—what  is 
going to happen—what is the risk to our economy and our society 
if we as a Nation continue down the path we are on now with eco-
nomic inequality continuing to worsen? 
I will start with you and anyone else who would like to comment. 
Dr. Boushey. Well, if we—— 
Vice Chair Maloney. Not a good trend. 
Dr. Boushey. No, it is not a good trend. 
You know, if we believe Thomas Piketty’s book, if we allow in-
come inequality to continue unabated, it leads to greater wealth 
concentration. And, you know, it will only—it will take a seemingly 
heroic political effort to change that. 
I think that the evidence is also that that kind of wealth con-
centration  is  constricting  of  our  economy  more  generally.  It  ob-
structs people’s ability to move up. It is making it harder for people 
to start new businesses and to have the kind of innovation economy 
that we want in many sectors because of the concentration. And it 
is having real distortionary effects on both consumption and invest-
ment. 
There is new research out that talks about the ways that, be-
cause of the rise in the concentration of savings, one would expect 
that that leads to investment. But, in fact, it has been leading to

an expansion in household credit, which as we all learned during 
the Great Recession, can be destabilizing. 
I want to add on the international comparisons that our level of 
income inequality and wealth inequality here in the United States, 
when you look across countries, appears to be very much a choice 
that we have made. Other countries, according to the data we have, 
have not experienced the same kind of inequality that we have, but 
they have been subject to the same trends in terms of globalization 
and technology. And so I think really looking deep inside the kinds 
of institutions that we are putting in place to constrain inequality 
is important. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you. And my time has expired. 
Chairman, Chairman Lee. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you, Madam Vice Chair. 
Dr. Zucman, I would like to get back with you for a minute. For 
purposes of determining tax rates, you group people, as I under-
stand it, by the income that they receive. And my understanding 
is also that you include Social Security benefits and unemployment 
insurance income when you create those groupings. Is that right? 
So someone receiving unemployment benefits would end up look-
ing a lot poorer and does have a higher tax rate if you didn’t count 
those benefits as income. Is that correct? 
Dr. Zucman. That is correct, but we do count these benefits as 
income. 
Chairman Lee. Got it. And yet you don’t count other govern-
ment transfers as income when you group people. So doesn’t that 
make them look a lot poorer and thus have higher tax rates than 
if you counted those benefits in that category? 
Dr. Zucman. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We have thought 
a lot about these methodological questions, which are extremely 
important. There are many ways to compute income, many ways. 
And government agencies use a variety of ways and research pa-
pers use different definitions. 
Chairman Lee. No, I get it. And I don’t want to oversimplify the 
task. I don’t want to describe it as overly simple. I just want to 
make sure I am understanding correctly. You do make this classi-
fication? 
Dr. Zucman. What we do—specifically what we do is we dis-
tribute 100 percent of national income, you know, which is GDP 
minus capital depreciation, plus net income received from abroad, 
100 percent. If you want to include transfers in your measure of 
income to compute tax rates, then you are allocating more than 100 
percent of national income. 
And so by construction, if you give people more income than the 
total amount of income that there is in the economy, you are going 
to underestimate the tax rates of certain groups of the population. 
So that is the reason why we do things the way we do. 
But  what  I  want  to  emphasize,  which  is  very  important,  is, 
again, what we are doing is a prototype to be improved and to be 
better done by government statisticians than by researchers. We 
hope the work we put out will be taken over, will be improved, will 
be refined, and will be published by government statistical agen-
cies, including, you know, covering the entire distribution from the 
bottom to the very, very top.

Chairman Lee. I totally get that, and I respect the effort. And 
that is one of the reasons we are having this conversation today, 
is because we have got to figure out effective, agreed-upon ways of 
measuring these things. 
I guess my question to you is, why is your treatment of Social 
Security  income  and  unemployment  insurance  income  different 
than the other categories of government transfers? How is that— 
how is it consistent ideologically? 
Dr. Zucman. We have two measures of income. One measure is 
pretax income after the operation of the pension system, so includ-
ing Social Security benefits and unemployment insurance benefits. 
And another measure of income that we have is post-tax income, 
subtracting  all  taxes  and  adding  all  other  forms  of  government 
spending. 
These are the two consistent measures of income that you can 
compute in the sense that they distribute 100 percent of national 
income. You can construct other measures—and we do both. And 
you can compute tax rates as a fraction of pretax income or post- 
tax income, and we do both. You can construct other measures of 
income, but they won’t add up to 100 percent of national income. 
So they won’t make it possible to decompose economic growth by 
social group. They will capture either less or more than 100 percent 
of national income, which then raises lots of technical problems 
when computing tax rates and so on. 
Chairman Lee. Yeah, I get it. I get it. 
I still—as long as we are having the conversation about, you 
know, making sure that we have effective measures, I don’t think 
that really responds to the underlying concern about how you dif-
ferentiate that. I understand that if you plus certain things up, if 
you leave them out, you are going to have less than 100 percent. 
If you count other things twice, that would be bad too. But that 
doesn’t answer this central concern. 
I got one more question in the small amount of time I have got 
remaining. In—your peer-reviewed 2018 paper indicated that the 
top 1 percent of the top 1 percent saw its tax rate fall between 
1964 and 2014 by 1 percentage point. Your book, if I understand 
it correctly, now shows a drop of 20 points. 
Am I reading those wrong or is there an inconsistency? If there 
is, which one is right? 
Dr. Zucman. So we constantly refine and improve our methods 
to incorporate new data and better techniques. So for that par-
ticular question, we changed the way that we allocate the corporate 
tax, because now we have a better understanding of how to do that 
conceptually. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Congressman Beyer. 
Representative Beyer. Thank you very much. 
One of the—when we talk about income inequality, I occasionally 
get the question ‘‘so what?’’ You know, Jeff Bezos makes $110 bil-
lion, and my daughter makes $48,000, but she is not hungry and 
she is maybe happier than he is. 
Dr. Boushey, you talked about why income inequality is bad for 
the economy. I would love for you to expand on the first point, 
which is that it obstructs the supply of talent, ideas, and capital.

I had an economics professor who spent the last 10 years of his ca-
reer trying to figure out why kids in the lowest quartile never ap-
plied to my alma mater, even though they are obviously—IQ is 
fairly randomly distributed. And you would point out that far more 
important than a child’s aptitude score is their parental income. 
Dr. Boushey. Yeah. There is a lot of great—there are a lot of 
great pieces of research that answer that ‘‘so what’’ question. One 
of the ones that I keep coming back to is work by Raj Chetty and 
a long list of coauthors that looks at the distribution of patents. 
There is fascinating data on who gets a patent, who applies for a 
patent and who gets one, and the person’s income as an adult. And 
they also have data on that person’s third grade math test scores 
and their parents’ income when they were in third grade. 
So they find—you know, on the first cut, they find the obvious, 
kids that do really good on those third grade math tests are much 
more likely to grow up and get a patent, become an inventor. But 
they also find that children from the top quartile who are the chil-
dren who get the top math scores, who are in the top income quar-
tile are four times as likely to grow up and get a patent than other 
children. 
So income inequality has this really important effect on whether 
or  not  smart  kids  who,  you  know—who  otherwise  could  be 
innovators in our economy, or contributing in a variety of ways, are 
moving their way up. 
Now, there are a lot of different hypotheses and research on why 
those kids aren’t moving up. Is it because they are living in dif-
ferent communities and they don’t see opportunity? Is it because 
they can’t get a student loan? Is it because they don’t graduate 
from high school, again, because of a bad neighborhood? 
So there are a lot of different policy interventions. But what is 
important to note is that there is something peculiar about a soci-
ety where you have, you know, the rungs of the income ladder fur-
ther and further apart that makes it really difficult for people to 
move up. 
And so where the research keeps coming back to is that that in-
dicator of inequality is something in and of itself that we need to 
address above and beyond all of the kinds of micropolicy interven-
tions that we might take to help that one child succeed. 
Representative Beyer. I want to keep building on your second 
point. Because one of the things that we struggle with all the time 
is how incredibly polarized the American public is, especially over 
politics. And as a Democrat, I am always trying to understand the 
core 40 percent that is very, very loyal to our President. And there 
are some interesting essays in the last couple of weeks about peo-
ple who have felt so left out of the economy, they just want to burn 
the house down, the notion of the chaos theory. 
And your second point is, you talked about the fundamental in-
stitutions being distorted by this; you know, that economic inequal-
ity gives people disproportionate political influence; laws, regula-
tions, things like that. 
Dr. Boushey. Yeah. I mean, I think that this is—this question 
is actually why I am so passionate about this data that we are 
talking about here today. Because we have not connected the dots 
that so many communities have been left behind. And because we

aren’t  faced  with  that  information  every  quarter,  we  are  not 
searching for solutions to get at it. 
I fear that it has been 40 years where—you know, we know that 
it has been 40 years where income inequality has been rising, but 
we haven’t focused on making sure that we are bringing all those 
people forward. 
And so now, in 2019, you have got communities where people are 
like, yeah, we haven’t seen economic growth, we haven’t seen vital-
ity, people are ignoring us. And I think—and being in this town for 
20 years, it is because we haven’t seen it. 
So, I mean, just to sort of bring it back to today’s hearing, seeing 
that I think can help us open up the doors to all of the different 
solutions that we need to take to make sure that we are including 
people  in  our  economy.  Because  the  reality  is,  is  that  the  data 
available shows that we aren’t. 
And it is everything from the lack of jobs available to what we 
are doing in terms of investments in education, and, you know, ev-
erything in between. But that reality that some communities are 
being left behind and policymakers haven’t taken the steps to forge 
that comprehensive agenda seems to be at the core of a lot of this 
polarization. But I am an economist, so I am always going to read 
economics into politics. 
Representative Beyer. But I, too, I sometimes wonder if I lived 
in a very disadvantaged rural community that had seen no growth 
whatsoever, that I might be drawn to a ‘‘Make America Great’’ 
message also. 
Dr. Boushey. Yeah. 
Representative Beyer. I yield back. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Congressman Schweikert. 
Representative Schweikert. Thank you. And I will try to stay 
off the hook this time. 
Dr. Zwick, a question I have had in—and I have actually hunted 
for credible information on it. What is the size of the underground 
economy? 
Dr. Zwick. In the United States? 
Representative Schweikert. Just the United States. 
Dr. Zwick.  So  it  is  a  little  bit  outside  my  lanes.  My  under-
standing is it is smaller than it is in other developing countries, 
but—— 
Representative Schweikert. Understood. And where I go with 
that is, many years ago when I was a much younger man, one of 
the projects we were assigned is try to take individuals in our com-
munity and model, not their income, but their consumption, what 
they had. 
And, look, this was undergraduate, so it wasn’t particularly bril-
liant math. But we had consumption double what we believed the 
very households we looked at’s income. And that was just really 
hard to say were they just brilliant in their consumption? Were 
there things we didn’t understand? Were there—because just—if 
that is—in two or three of the lowest quartiles, that sort of distor-
tion, it lets you start to understand what is wrong in our sample 
data, what are we not understanding. 
And I had some—many years later, some experiences when I was 
the treasurer for a very, very large county and doing the taxes, col-

lections,  and  all  those  things,  and  realizing  some  of  the  things 
didn’t seem to line up where, you know, the value of the home, this 
and that, didn’t match what we thought we knew about the house-
hold. 
Dr.  Zwick.  If  I  may,  Congressman,  briefly.  One  of  the  open 
questions in this measuring inequality literature is how we dis-
tribute the underreported or unreported income. So one of my sug-
gestions on expanding an audit program that would help us meas-
ure the underground economy and think about its distribution, how 
it is distributed relative to the income we do observe, actually, I 
think could be quite helpful and speak directly to your question. 
Representative Schweikert. Wouldn’t a more elegant, at least, 
test from your income inequality would be a consumption model, 
just to sort of—because that would let you know that there is some-
thing distortive, and see if that same distortion from 30 years ago 
still exists, because—and also—and help you understand, because 
it would really give you some great targeting information of why 
are some communities—and this is where I was heading, and it 
would  be  for  Doug  Holtz-Eakin—we  see  entrepreneurial—you 
know,  some  of  our  ethnic  population,  some  of  our  communities, 
some of the education and those things, have clusters of entrepre-
neurship, that seems to be what creates tremendous amount of 
that velocity. And I have always wondered how I could sort of iden-
tify why and where. It is—I mean, we often see that the fastest 
movement for really moving out of lower quartiles is actually some 
type of entrepreneurship. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. So before we leave the observation on con-
sumption, there has been lots of very good work. And I would point 
to Bruce Meyer and his various coauthors, looking at consumption- 
based measures of poverty. And they do, in fact, paint a different 
picture than the conventional income-based measures of poverty; 
the level of poverty is lower, there has been diminished poverty. 
But it doesn’t change the fact that we still have some pressing pov-
erty problems. But I would suggest that to you. 
On the entrepreneurship, this is fascinating. So one of the—one 
of the best test cases and interesting phenomenons is immigrants. 
Immigrants to the United States are disproportionately entrepre-
neurial. They start businesses at a higher rate than the native- 
born population. And in some cases, they have sort of pooled fi-
nance as an immigrant community. They will sort of develop the 
financing mechanisms. And you can take countries in Asia, in par-
ticular, Southeast Asia, and look at their performance in the U.S., 
and there are dramatically different rates of native entrepreneur-
ship when they arrive in the U.S. Very small differences in culture. 
So it is not just the economic circumstances that determine this. 
Representative Schweikert. But does that make an argument, 
if we desperately wanted to help a community that has suffered, 
that some of what is in there is better education, better this, but 
also an entrepreneurship of starting the plumbing or the food truck 
or whatever, you know, even if it is a level of microfinance? 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. It is Professor Zwick’s job to grow new entre-
preneurs. I would argue we should just have as few barriers to 
them as possible.

Representative Schweikert. Well, in many ways, that is one 
of the discussions we have a lot, particularly in Arizona, is can you 
make it not scary. A single stop to get a permit, to get a license, 
to get this, to get that. So—because in many ways, it is a knowl-
edge barrier that keeps these things from actually happening. 
So, Madam Vice Chair, thank you. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Congressman Heck. 
Representative Heck. Thank you. 
Maybe next to Fed policy that revs my motor is housing policy. 
So I want to begin by asking if any of you have either studied the 
issue of the relationship between homeownership and wealth in-
equality or have a working knowledge of other people’s work in this 
regard? 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I have studied homeownership over a number 
of years, especially tax policy toward homeownership. 
Representative Heck. So—good. Thank you. 
Let me lay out my construct and then just have you react to it. 
Homeownership is falling, especially among millennials. It is fully 
15 percent lower than the generation of 30 and 60 years ago, even 
when excluding those who are still living upstairs or downstairs. 
And what we know about homeownership is that while consumer 
preferences are changing, it is still a commonly held aspiration of 
this country. We know that it is, on average, the number one net 
worth  building  tool  for  Americans,  and  we  know  that  to  defer 
homeownership is to squeeze down the value at the end of that 
journey. 
My favorite expression, when I am not citing another favorite ex-
pression, is the two most powerful forces on the face of the Earth 
are the status quo and compound interest. And with long term— 
the longer term homeownership you have, the more compounded 
interest you have, as it were, which obviously affects people’s re-
tirement security. It affects what it is they are able to bequeath to 
their—to their offspring. Obviously, it also disproportionately af-
fects those who are unable to capture that first rung on the ladder. 
So like everything else, low-income people are disproportionately 
impacted by deferred homeownership or lack of access to homeown-
ership. 
So, I guess, there is my construct. There are a lot of reasons to 
explain what is happening. That is not our purpose here today. But 
I would appreciate some reflection on just this general construct. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I think it is a complicated area. It is a really 
good question. The first thing I would just politely disagree with 
a little bit is I was—— 
Representative Heck. Careful. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I am aware, sir. 
You know, I was in the White House in 2001, 2002, and there 
was  a  heavy  emphasis  on  getting  minority  homeownership  up, 
pushing, pushing, pushing. The instruments by which we typically 
push are subsidies to the debt portion of the homeownership acqui-
sition. That continued on a relatively bipartisan basis right into the 
Great Recession, and we wiped out the wealth of a lot of minority 
America. 
So I am more skeptical than some about the automatic wealth- 
building aspects of homeownership. We have some history that sug-

gests people might want to be cautious about, especially people who 
are young who just looked at that. They are concerned about it. So 
that is sort of number one. 
Number two, there are—— 
Representative Heck. Stop. That is an argument about how 
you go—what is the best way to go about solving the problem state-
ment. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I also agree with that, yes. 
Representative Heck. It is not an argument about any of the 
things I laid out in my construct, because I didn’t offer a solution. 
In fact, if I would offer a solution, I would go back to the last dis-
cussion we had, which is the best way to increase homeownership 
overall is get people’s incomes up so they can afford it. But there 
are a lot of—— 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. That is what I was going to say next. So I 
agree with that. 
Representative  Heck.  Okay.  But  is  it  a  material  factor  in 
wealth inequality or is it becoming one? 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. It was a very material factor in the rise in 
wealth inequality in the Great Recession, because the bottom dis-
appeared. They lost their wealth. There is no question about it. 
It  has  consequences—knock-on  consequences.  So,  for  example, 
lots of entrepreneurs use the equity in their home as the way to 
finance things. So, you know, how—how big is that right now? I 
don’t know, but it is a phenomenon. 
In terms of things that can be done, probably most of the impor-
tant levers are at the State and local level where land use restric-
tions, zoning and things like that, are making some things just too 
expensive, and the restrictions on the supply are a big concern. 
And that is something that could be dealt with by States and local-
ities. 
Representative Heck. And you say that as somebody who has 
actually studied the relationship between tax policy and homeown-
ership. 
I—our purpose here today is not to argue—well, maybe it is—the 
specific solutions to the problem statement I laid out. But I would 
push back very considerably on your notion that the Federal Gov-
ernment does not have a significant role to play in this, be it tax 
policy or how—you said the major—— 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. To be clear, it has a major role. I just don’t 
like the way it has executed that. I would rather see, for exam-
ple—— 
Representative Heck. Okay. Come up with something better. 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin [continuing]. Have a new—a new homeowner 
tax credit instead of, hey, get a big mortgage. That is not a good 
message. 
Representative Heck. Something that enables more people. 
All right. We are good. I yield back. Thank you, Madam Vice 
Chair. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you. This has been a very spirited 
conversation. 
And I want to go back to how you were measuring wealth. I am 
a former teacher and a former social worker. And I worked in in-
credibly poor neighborhoods in New York. And I have worked with

families that had significant social transfers from the State, living 
on  welfare,  subsidized  housing  and  public  housing.  We  have 
700,000  families  in  public  housing,  subsidized  housing  in  New 
York.  The  WIC  program,  which  is  food  for  children.  Fuel,  they 
had—we have these programs where the fuel is subsidized, and 
many, many food programs. And even before ObamaCare, in New 
York City, the healthcare of the poor is taken care of. Anybody who 
is sick is taken care of in our public hospitals. 
So that is a significant amount of support that is going to a fam-
ily. Are you measuring that in your—in your numbers? 
Dr. Zucman. Yes. Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman. 
Yes, we do, in our work, distributional national accounts, we do 
allocate all government spending, including monetary transfers, in- 
kind transfers, such as health spending, Medicare, Medicaid, and 
also spending on public goods like education, like police, like de-
fense, everything. We take all forms of government spending that 
we distribute to the—that we allocate to the entire population. Just 
like we do for taxes, we do the same—the exact same thing, com-
prehensively for government transfers. 
And when you do that, what you see is that U.S. Government 
does redistribute resources. It is overall, you know, redistributive, 
of course. 
And what I want to stress, again, is that, you know, it is hard 
to allocate many forms of government spending. Who benefits from 
defense spending? 
Vice Chair Maloney. Everyone. 
Dr.  Zucman.  Some  people  believe  that  wealthy  benefit  more 
from defense spending. That is arguable. It is hard. It is not for us 
to say. 
Vice Chair Maloney. 9/11 attacked everyone in the vicinity. It 
didn’t benefit anyone. 
Dr. Zucman. I totally agree that—and that is the way we do it. 
You know, the way we allocate it is we allocate it to everyone. But 
what I want to say is that these are difficult questions—or difficult 
choices to make, and these choices are better made by government 
statisticians—— 
Vice Chair Maloney. I need to read your book. Then we can 
have another hearing. 
Dr. Zucman [continuing]. By government agencies than by aca-
demics. We hope that our little prototype is going to be taken over, 
is going to be done by government statisticians and improved. It 
can be improved in many ways. 
Vice Chair Maloney. I would now like to yield to—call on Mr. 
Lee and—— 
Chairman Lee. I didn’t want to end this hearing without giving 
you a chance to talk to us about the concept of tax competition and 
whether or not you think we are in a vulnerable position as a re-
sult of it. What worries you about tax competition? 
Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Tax competition is very real. And it drove the 
structure of the corporate reforms in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 
because those mimic what has happened across the OECD and the 
movement away from worldwide systems.

The reality is that it is impossible to identify where and when 
a dollar is earned around the globe. And to try to tax it in the U.S. 
at that moment is a virtually impossible job. 
So we have moved toward, I think, a realistic positioning of our-
selves in the competitive world for the moment. The rates in the 
middle  of  the  developed  country  world,  21  percent.  The  base  is 
more like one we would have. And it better positions our companies 
to compete internationally, and that is good for the workers. And 
that ultimately is the objective. 
I don’t think that will—that will stay still. Like when we did the 
1986 reforms, we had the lowest corporate rate in the developed 
world, and we were way behind by the time 2017 rolled around. I 
expect the rest of the world to keep moving. We will have to just 
see where we are competitively. 
Vice Chair Maloney. I thank everybody. It really has been in-
credibly interesting. Economic inequality is a major challenge fac-
ing this country. It is not good for the rich. It is not good for the 
poor. It is not good for the country overall. And we need to do a 
better job measuring inequality, tracking it, and most importantly, 
addressing it. 
So I am really very grateful to all of you for your research and 
for what you shared with us today. You gave us a lot of good in-
sights on a very critical issue. Thank you so much. 
We are adjourned.

PREPAREDSTATEMENTOFHON. CAROLYNB. MALONEY, VICECHAIR, JOINT 
ECONOMICCOMMITTEE 
Last month, the Census Bureau reported that income inequality in the United 
States, by one measure, had reached its highest level since they began tracking it 
more than 50 years ago. 
For the typical worker, wages have been stagnant for four decades. 
On the other hand, those at the top are doing great. 
The top 1 percent of households in the United States now take home about 20 
percent of the total income. 
The wealthiest 1 percent own nearly 40 percent of total wealth. 
Those at the very top—the top one-tenth of 1 percent—have seen their share of 
wealth double since 1990. 
That narrow sliver of the population—the top tenth of 1 percent—now own more 
than the bottom 80 percent of Americans. 
One of our witnesses today, Dr. Gabriel Zucman, has done important work track-
ing these trends going back a century. 
His most recent work looks at the role played by our tax system. 
It is widely believed that our tax system is progressive—that the rich pay a larger 
percentage of their income in taxes. 
However, Dr. Zucman’s recent work reveals that in 2018 the wealthiest 400 Amer-
icans paid a lower tax rate than any other income group. 
Sadly, this is not an accident—it is deliberate public policy. 
In 2017, the Republican Congress and President Trump slashed taxes on the rich 
... Borrowing $1.9 trillion to do it. 
Inequality in America was already sky high. 
The Republican tax cuts made it far worse. 
Skyrocketing inequality undermines our middle-class society, in which anyone 
who works hard has a chance to succeed. 
It means that for millions of Americans, the American dream may be a myth. 
Our second witness, economist Heather Boushey, argues that high levels of in-
equality undermine economic growth ... 
... because strong growth depends in part on a strong middle class. 
Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of the U.S. economy. 
But as a larger and larger share of income and wealth go to those at the top, 
there is less left over for everyone else. 
As a result, most Americans have less money in their pockets, less to spend on 
what businesses sell. 
Therefore, when the bottom 50 percent—those who consume a much larger share 
of income compared to those at the top—see no income growth for 40 years, that’s 
a major problem. 
Extreme inequality also undermines our communities. 
The Chairman and I agree that healthy communities with strong ‘‘social capital’’ 
are critical to a high quality of life. 
But extreme inequality undermines that. 
When wealth is highly concentrated and in a society where education is critical 
to success, families have extremely high incentives to live in towns with other 
wealthy families, so they can put their children in the best school systems. 
So, Americans increasingly become segregated by wealth and their quality of life 
becomes dependent on their zip code. 
Extreme inequality also undermines our democratic institutions. 
It enables the powerful to rig the rules—to make themselves even more powerful. 
We see the erosion of antitrust laws, the breakdown of protections for small inves-
tors, the rejection of overtime protections for workers. 
We pay a very high price for extreme inequality. 
How bad is inequality in the United States? 
Economists disagree about the severity of the problem. 
But while they disagree about how much inequality has worsened in recent dec-
ades, there is little disagreement ... 
... things are getting worse. 
One way that we measure the strength of our economy is by quarterly measures 
of gross domestic product. It is a good, aggregate number—it tells us how fast the 
whole economic ‘‘pie’’ is growing. 
But the ‘‘slices’’ of the pie that go to the rich, middle class and poor are extremely 
unequal. 
Unfortunately, we currently don’t measure how economic growth is shared.

For this reason, I have introduced the Measuring Real Income Growth Act. And 
I’m pleased that Senator Heinrich is again introducing a companion bill in the Sen-
ate. 
The bill would require the Bureau of Economic Analysis to report GDP growth 
by income decile and the top 1 percent alongside the top line number. 
It will help us understand not just how fast the economy is growing but who is 
benefiting from that growth. 
Academic economists, such as Dr. Zucman, have produced estimates similar to 
those we are asking for from BEA. But we need the government to do this is in 
a regular and timely manner. 
Inequality is one of the most pressing issues of our day. It is tearing our society 
apart and undermining much of what we stand for. 
In order to understand inequality, we must have better ways to measure it—ways 
that are accepted by those on both sides of the aisle. 
With that information in hand, we can begin to restore our country to the land 
of opportunity. 
PREPAREDSTATEMENTOFHON. MIKELEE, CHAIRMAN, JOINTECONOMICCOMMITTEE 
Thank you, Vice Chair Maloney, for calling this hearing. 
Inequality has been a hinge of American politics, and indeed in all democracies, 
for as long as there have been democracies. And with good reason. The concentra-
tion of economic power can be as dangerous as the concentration of political power. 
Unfortunately, the debate about inequality—like many debates these days—can 
be easily swept up into a partisan exercise of talking past each other. 
We could spend our entire time today haggling over whether ‘‘inequality’’ is best 
understood as unequal opportunity, or unequal outcomes. 
Or indeed, if the latter, we could argue for hours about whether and how much 
it is even a problem, given that almost every facet of modern life—from air condi-
tioning to airplanes—can be counted among the blessings of the intentionally un-
equal benefits of free enterprise. 
Inequality is such a large concept that it is impossible to tackle in a single hear-
ing. That is why I commend the Vice Chair for organizing today’s hearing on ‘‘meas-
uring’’ inequality. And for inviting an excellent panel of witnesses who can help us 
navigate the issue. 
The subject of data measurement techniques is at once narrow enough to keep 
our discussion focused, and—hopefully—technical enough that even Congress can 
set aside political temptations and simply drill down on some important questions. 
For instance: 
• How should we define ‘‘income’’ for purposes of measuring inequality between 
rich, poor, and middle class? 
• How should we count government transfers—like the Earned Income Tax Cred-
it—for lower-income workers? 
• As the scholarship on inequality measurement has progressed, which technical 
details have survived peer-review scrutiny, and which remain to be worked out 
before we can reach academic consensus? 
These are not the questions that will lead cable news political talk shows. That’s 
why they are exactly the kind the Joint Economic Committee should be taking up. 
Even the best policies involve tradeoffs. 
Our economy is growing, and today employs more people than ever before. But 
it has been a long slog out of the Great Recession, much longer for some than oth-
ers. 
If the data really can afford us a clearer view of how the costs and benefits of 
economic growth are being experienced up and down the income scale, that is anal-
ysis we should all insist on getting ... and insist on getting right. 
Thank you again Madam Vice Chair, and to the witnesses for being here today. 
I look forward to your testimony and our discussion.

You have extensively researched how wealthy taxpayers and corpora-
tions take advantage of offshore tax havens to evade payment of U.S. taxes. 
• In your opinion, how has the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act affected the 
amount of wealth stored in these offshore tax havens, and what impact 
has this had on economic inequality? 
Thank you for your question, Senator. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the 
Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and moved the U.S. towards 
a so-called ‘‘territorial’’ tax system, whereby profits booked outside of the United 
States are not taxable in the U.S. Such a system gives corporations incentive to 
book profits in foreign tax havens. Although the Act contains a number of anti- 
abuse provisions, it is thus possible that the amount of profits booked by U.S. com-
panies in offshore havens will grow as a consequence of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
It is too soon, however, to make precise quantitative statements about this phe-
nomenon at this stage. In my opinion the main effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
was to dramatically reduce Federal corporate income tax revenue, increasing income 
for shareholders. Because equity ownership is highly concentrated in the United 
States, this is likely to increase inequality.

Our antitrust enforcement agencies need adequate tools and resources to 
address the threat of economic concentration, promote competition, and 
protect consumers. In recent decades we have seen weakened antitrust en-
forcement coupled with rising economic inequality. I have introduced leg-
islation to modernize antitrust enforcement—including by updating merger 
filing fees to reflect the 21st century economy. 
• What role does vigorous antitrust enforcement play in promoting inno-
vation and reducing economic inequality? 
Vigorous antitrust enforcement protects competition and helps address inequality. 
Modern studies show that growing monopoly power is a problem for consumers and 
innovators. A recently released antitrust literature review summarizes modern anti-
trust and competition research, much of which shows us that more competition is 
good for innovation.1 Over the last decade, we have seen the role rising monopoly 
power has on stifling innovation, especially in the drug manufacturing and tech in-
dustries.2 Monopoly power also exacerbates inequality because those who benefit 
from higher monopoly rents (stockholders and senior executives) are wealthier than 
the consumers, who pay higher prices, and the workers, who earn lower wages, 
harmed by market power.3 
However, the agencies charged with enforcing these laws need adequate resources 
to take appropriate action. Today, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the De-
partment of Justice’s (DOJ) Antitrust Division are under-resourced, with annual ap-
propriations on a steady decline since 2010 and now 18 percent lower in real terms

than in 2010.4 Enforcement has fallen to historic lows as funding has dropped. 
Merger enforcement actions have stagnated as merger filings have risen over the 
past decade and fewer corporations are being fined for antitrust violations since 
2012–2014, and especially since the 1990s. As our economy grows, the need for re-
sources to regulate it grows in unison.

Gabriel Zucman 
Associate Professor of Economics, UC Berkeley 
Testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, 
Hearing on “Measuring Economic Inequality in the United States” 
October 16, 2019 
 
Thank you, Chairman Lee and Vice Chair Maloney, for inviting me to speak today. 
It’s an honor to be here. 
 
My name is Gabriel Zucman and I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the 
University of California, Berkeley.  
 
My work seeks to advance the measurement of inequality.  
 
With my colleagues Facundo Alvaredo, Lucas Chancel, Thomas Piketty, and 
Emmanuel Saez, I am one of the co-directors of the World Inequality Database, an 
extensive database on the long-run evolution of income and wealth inequality.  
 
One of our goals is to contribute to the creation of comprehensive, standardized, 
and internationally comparable inequality statistics that capture all forms of 
income contributing to GDP. 
 
Concretely, when GDP grows 3% in a given year, we want to be able to know how 
income is growing for each social group, in a way that’s consistent with the official 
rate of GDP growth.  
 
We call these statistics Distributional National Accounts. 
 
To understand the ultimate goal and the value of this project, the following analogy 
is helpful. 
 
According to the official National Accounts of the United States, real GDP grew 
2.9% in 2018. 
 
This number involves some uncertainty.  
 
The measurement of GDP, after all, relies on many assumptions.  
  1 
 
There are projections based on preliminary reports that can only be confirmed 
months or years down the road.  
 
There are imputations, for example of the rents that homeowners pay to 
themselves. 
 
There are assumptions about how much income is under-reported by taxpayers to 
the IRS.  
 
Despite these uncertainties, most people trust official estimates of GDP.  
 
These estimates are based on methods that have been improved over several 
decades.  
 
They are based on internationally-agreed and constantly refined concepts and 
methods.  
 
They are constructed by hundreds of highly qualified government statisticians. 
 
My hope is that one day, we’ll reach the point where statistics of inequality are 
constructed and regarded like GDP statistics. 
 
With my colleagues, we try to contribute to this evolution. 
 
We have created prototype Distributional National Accounts, that is, statistics that 
distribute the national account aggregates — such as national income, household 
wealth, tax revenue, and government spending — across the population. 
 
These prototype Distributional National Accounts are based on a conceptual 
framework that we developed over several years.  
 
They are based on harmonized guidelines, concepts, and estimation techniques that 
we have applied and are applying to many countries.  
 
They are constantly updated when new data become available and refined 
estimation techniques are designed. 
 
  2 
 
All the data series are made available in a user-friendly manner on the World 
Inequality Database WID.world.  
 
All programs, computer code, and technical appendices are publicly available; all 
our results can be replicated using publicly available data.  
 
Users are free to change our methodology and we constantly refine our methods as 
we receive new feedback and new knowledge emerges. 
These prototype Distributional National Accounts show a large rise in income 
inequality.  
 
In 1980, the top 1% earned 10% of total pre-tax national income. 
 
Today it earns close to 20% of total pre-tax national income, according to these 
data. 
 
In 1980, the average pre-tax income of adults in the bottom 50% of the income 
distribution was $18,000, adjusted for inflation.  
 
Today, it is almost the same number—$18,500.  
 
Although we put considerable effort in building this prototype, it remains a 
prototype. The methods underpinning our Distributional National Accounts are 
still in their infancy.  
 
Much more work needs to be done. 
 
Our hope is that these prototype Distributional National Accounts will eventually 
be taken over by government, improved, and published as part of the official 
toolkit of government statistics. 
 
This is what happened for the national accounts in the first place. 
 
The national accounts were developed in the first half and in the middle of the 
twentieth century by scholars in the United States (such as Simon Kuznets), the 
United Kingdom (such as James Meade and Richard Stone), France (such as 
Jacques de Bernonville), and many other countries.   
  3 
 
Then governments agencies took them over, refined them, and still constantly 
improve them today.  
 
We hope the same process will happen for Distributional National Accounts. 
 
It may take years, even decades. 
 
In the meantime, it is perfectly normal to have methodological discussions, 
debates, and disagreements.  
 
This does not mean that we cannot know what is happening to inequality today.  
 
A wide array of evidence shows high and rising inequality.  
 
This includes survey data such as the Current Population Survey (for income) and 
the Survey of Consumer Finances (for wealth), company data on CEO pay (from 
Compustat), tabulations of tax returns by the IRS, and named lists of wealthy 
individuals (e.g., by Forbes magazine).  
 
All these data show inequality rising markedly since the 1980s. 
 
Each of these sources have limitations. All economic statistics are constructions, 
whose limitations must be understood.  
But by working together, we can arrive at the best possible estimates and reach the 
stage where the publication of inequality statistics will be just like the publication 
of GDP. 
 
I look forward to your questions. Thank you.

Heather Boushey 
Washington Center for Equitable Growth 
Testimony before the Joint Economic Committee,  
Hearing on “Measuring Economic Inequality in the United States” 
October 16, 2019 
 
Thank you, Chairman Lee and Vice Chair Maloney, for inviting me to speak today. It’s an honor 
to be here. 
 
My name is Heather Boushey and I am President and CEO of the Washington Center for 
Equitable Growth. We seek to advance evidence-backed ideas and policies that promote strong, 
stable, and broad-based economic growth. 
 
By any measure, income inequality in the United States has increased significantly over the past 
40 years. This increase in inequality has constricted the growth of our economy and had an 
insidious effect on our political institutions. The topic of today’s hearing speaks to a small but 
significant step we can take toward more equitable growth. 
 
One of the most important things we can do to fight inequality in the United States right now is 
to start keeping track of it. Government statistics—Gross Domestic Product growth, inflation, 
jobs added, wage increases—drive economic policymaking in Congress, the Federal Reserve, 
and executive agencies. Better measurements of inequality are overdue additions to this list.  
 
To properly contextualize economic growth, policymakers should ask the U.S. Bureau of 
Economic Analysis, or BEA, to add measures of growth within income quantiles to the National 
Income and Product Accounts. This is what we at Equitable Growth call “GDP 2.0”—an 
extension to our existing National Income accounts that updates them to better reflect the 
realities of our 21st century economy. 
 
I want to thank Vice Chair Maloney and Sen. Heinrich, as well as Senator Schumer, for 
introducing a bill in 2018 that would do just that and for continuing their efforts in this Congress. 
The Measuring Real Income Growth Act of 2018 would tell us what growth looks like for low-, 
middle-, and high-income Americans. 
 
This bill would task the Bureau of Economic Analysis with adding distributional measures of 
growth to its quarterly National Income and Product Account releases so we could see not just 
that the economy grew by 2 percent or 3 percent, but also how much it grew for Americans of 
different incomes. (See Figure 1.)  
 
Figure 1: Existing BEA GDP report and sample rendition of GDP 2.0
 
 
 
Publishing this information would have four important effects. 
 
•  First, it will connect the idea of aggregate economic data to the real-life circumstances of 
families in the economy. When members of the working class see politicians touting 
strong growth but look around and see no evidence of it in their communities, they are 
right to feel that their economic needs are not being paid attention to. 
•  Second, by highlighting differences in how the economy is working for different groups 
of workers, it will focus our attention on the economic well-being of most families. 
•  Third, distributional measures of growth will guide policymakers in designing policies 
that both raise output and do it in a way in which everyone gains. 
•  Finally, these metrics will allow citizens to hold their elected representatives accountable 
to delivering an economy that works for all. 
It is critical to start capturing this data so we can ensure strong, stable, and broad-based 
economic growth. There is a large—and growing—body of empirical research that shows we 
cannot create strong or broadly shared economic gains through a policy agenda that presumes 
growth follows from allowing those at the top to reap the bulk of the gains. The policy agenda 
we have pursued for decades, driven largely by the desire to maximize GDP growth at any cost, 
is not delivering for American families and is creating inequities in the economy that actually 
constrict growth. 
In the sections that follow, I will explain why GDP growth became such an important indicator 
of economic success, how it became a poor proxy for the success of the average American 
family, and why we need a GDP 2.0 to better capture the full range of economic progress that is 
experienced by Americans up and down the income ladder. In the final section, I explain how 
inequality is constricting growth in the economy. 
 
One number for an entire economy 
 
The National Income and Product Accounts were pioneered in the 1930s by the economist 
Simon Kuznets. At the time, it was a radical new development in economic measurement. It let 
policymakers see for the first time just how much had been lost in the Great Depression and later 
helped them understand how the U.S. economy could be harnessed to go to war. For this 
groundbreaking work, Kuznets won the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics. 
 
The member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or 
OECD, at the time adopted Kuznets’ principals as a general framework and National Accounts 
became a global phenomenon. GDP, the most prominent measure of aggregate output in the 
National Accounts, has attained a unique level of authority to the exclusion of other markers of a 
nation’s development. Because it is standardized across nations and available as a relatively long 
time series, economists and policymakers alike have latched onto GDP as a way to adjudicate 
which national economies are best and to conduct inquiries into what makes some economies 
grow faster than others. 
 
But this was never the intent of Kuznets himself. In a section of his 1934 report to Congress 
titled “Uses and Abuses of National Income Measurements,” Kuznets noted that, “The welfare of 
a nation can, therefore, scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income.”1 This is 
true for many reasons, but Kuznets was especially concerned with the distribution of resources in 
society. He understood that high aggregate output was not necessarily indicative of well-being if 
the underlying distribution of income was highly unequal. To address this concern, he helped 
compile some of the very first breakdowns of inequality by income quintile. For a short time in 
the 1950s, BEA regularly produced these statistics, but they were abandoned due to a lack of 
funding.2 
 
Kuznets’ warnings have been repeated many times in the 85 years since he authored his report to 
Congress. Robert Kennedy famously echoed Kuznets’ warning when he said that GDP 
“measures everything … except that which makes life worthwhile.”3  
 
GDP growth has been treated for decades by pundits and policymakers alike as synonymous with 
prosperity, but this is no longer a useful indicator of well-being. President John F. Kennedy 
famously alluded to it when he said that “a rising tide lifts all boats.” In the decades since, 
economists and commentators have used the metaphor of “growing the pie” to indicate that we 
should first and foremost be concerned with growing the economy rather than concerning 
ourselves with who gets a slice. But the pie is no longer growing for many Americans because 
much of the growth of the past four decades has been captured largely by Americans at the top of 
the income distribution. 
 
Rising inequality means less informative aggregate statistics 
 
Over the period from 1980 to 2016, average growth was about 1.4 percent annually. Yet the 
bottom 85 percent of all adults saw income growth lower than this. Only those in the top 15 
percent experienced better-than-average growth.4 (See Figure 2.) 
 
Figure 2
 
 
This is a new phenomenon. Prior to this period, there was little need to disaggregate national 
growth because the headline GDP growth statistic was broadly representative of the economy as 
experienced by most Americans. Average growth was around 1.7 percent between 1963 and 
1979—higher than in the years since. And that growth was broadly shared, as the scatter plots of 
pretax and post-tax income growth for each percentile of income show in Figure 2. Most 
Americans saw income growth at or above that average.  
 
Today, GDP growth is decoupled from the fortunes of most Americans. What was once a useful 
indicator of how most families were faring is now unmoored from the experience of most 
families. Today’s economy is growing slower than in the past, and much of this growth benefits 
only those at the very top of the economic ladder. Incomes for the working class and the middle 
class have grown slowly for decades while incomes at the very top have exploded. 
 
Between 1980 and 2016, the bottom half of Americans by income saw average annual income 
growth of just 0.6 percent. The richest 10 percent of Americans, by contrast, enjoyed annual 
income growth of 2 percent, resulting in this group doubling their income over the 35-year 
period. But even they were left behind by the top 1 percent, who saw their income increase by 
162 percent over the same period.5 
 
The result is that the pretax distribution of income has returned to the Gilded Age levels of the 
1920s. The story is not quite so dramatic after government taxes and transfers, but by either 
measure, the share of total national income held by the top 1 percent has nearly doubled since 
hitting lows in the 1970s. (See Figure 3.) 
 
 
Figure 3
 
 
We see these same divergent trends across multiple measures of economic well-being: wages, 
income, and wealth. The implication for how we evaluate the economy is that mean economic 
progress is pulling away from median economic progress. Almost all of our national economic 
statistics are becoming less representative of the experience of most Americans. Reforming our 
national statistical infrastructure to account for this reality is long overdue. 
 
GDP 2.0: Measuring what matters 
 
GDP 2.0 refers to adding subpopulation estimates of income growth to our existing National 
Income and Product Accounts reports. Currently, the Bureau of Economic Analysis releases a 
new estimate of quarterly or annual GDP growth every month. Distributional national accounts 
would add to some of these releases an estimate that disaggregates the topline number and tells 
us what growth was experienced by low-, middle-, and high-income Americans. 
 
Academics have already constructed such a measure. The Distributional National Accounts (or 
DINA) dataset constructed by economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel Zucman 
disaggregates National Income growth from 1962 to 2016.6 This dataset gives us a complete 
picture of how inequality has changed in the United States over time and how recent growth in 
national output is being shared by Americans. In 2014, for example, total National Income 
growth was 2.1 percent. According to the DINA dataset, income growth for the lowest-earning 
50 percent of all Americans was just 0.4 percent, while growth for the richest 1 percent of 
Americans was 5.3 percent. 
 
The Bureau of Economic Analysis has begun studying how it could create its own similar dataset 
and has published preliminary findings for a small number of years in its Survey of Current 
Business.7  
 
Members of Congress have also realized the importance of constructing these new indicators. In 
2018, Sens. Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) and Rep. Carolyn Maloney 
(D-NY) introduced the Measuring Real Income Growth Act of 2018 in both chambers. The 
Senate bill garnered 24 co-sponsors. 
 
This initial legislative action has been followed by a flurry of further congressional interest. In 
March 2019, the conference report accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 
included a clause instructing Bureau of Economic Analysis to report income growth within 
deciles of income starting in 2020.8 In their appropriations bill for the Department of Commerce 
for FY2020, House appropriators instructed the agency to report on its progress toward the 
FY2019 appropriations language.9 Most recently, Senate appropriators allocated $1 million to 
the effort.10  
 
It is expected that Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish a prototype set of distributional 
growth figures in 2020 in accordance with these instructions from Congress. 
 
GDP 2.0 will inform policy 
 
Distributional national accounts will be an important tool for crafting policy in today’s unequal 
economy. To give one powerful example, distributional national accounts might have allowed 
policymakers to spot and correct the significant decline in absolute intergenerational income 
mobility in the United States that occurred over the past 60 years. 
 
It is intuitively unsurprising that societies with higher inequality are also societies with low 
economic mobility. Economist Miles Corak created what former Chair of the Council of 
Economic Advisers Alan Krueger called “The Great Gatsby Curve,” which plots the relationship 
between inequality and intergenerational mobility across countries. Countries with higher 
inequality tend to have lower economic mobility. Figure 4 shows one version of this curve. 
 
Figure 4
 
 
While critics often suggest that the relationship is not causal, more recent research shows that 
increasing inequality in the United States has significantly reduced absolute intergenerational 
mobility. Economist Raj Chetty has shown that children born in 1940—just before the baby 
boom, when inequality was low and growth was high—had a 90 percent chance of earning more 
than their parents. In contrast, Generation Xers born in 1980, when income inequality was high 
and growth was low, have just a 50 percent chance of surpassing their parents’ income.11 
 
More importantly, the evidence shows that even if children born in 1980 had experienced the 
same higher growth experienced by children born in 1940, this would have closed only about 
one-third of the mobility gap. But if children born in 1980 had instead faced the same levels of 
inequality as children in 1940 (even with the lower growth), this would have closed two-thirds of 
the mobility gap. Figure 5 illustrates rates of absolute mobility by parent income percentile and 
shows these counterfactuals. 
 
Figure 5
 
 
The implication is clear: Growth alone is not enough to produce strong absolute mobility. 
Distributional national accounts would allow us to track how growth is distributed annually and 
manage the economy accordingly to increase economic mobility. Notably, to diagnose this 
problem, it is not enough to know that median household income is stagnant. Understanding how 
mobility might be changing requires a complete picture of how growth is accruing to families all 
along the income curve, including at the very top. 
 
GDP 2.0 will help families understand the economy 
 
In addition to helping policymakers craft responses to changes in our economy, GDP 2.0 will 
also help families across the country understand how economic growth is related to their own 
personal circumstances. The separation of average growth from the experience of most 
Americans, as demonstrated above, leaves many feeling alienated when media trumpets high 
growth that does not reflect their own situation or the situation of those in their communities. 
GDP 2.0 will help people understand how the economy is working for them. 
 
Equally importantly, when the economy is not working for families up and down the income 
curve, that information will be widely known and voters will be empowered to hold 
policymakers accountable if the economy is not performing for all Americans. This link is 
important, because inequality isn’t simply bad for some families at the bottom of the income 
distribution. Inequality is bad for the economy itself.  
 
Economic inequality is bad for the economy 
 
The most critical reason we need to measure who is prospering from growth is because the levels 
of inequality we see now are harming our economy. Inequality constricts growth by:  
 
•  Obstructing the supply of people and ideas into our economy and limiting opportunity 
for those not already at the top, which slows productivity growth over time 
•  Subverting the institutions that manage the market, making our political system 
ineffective and our labor markets dysfunctional 
•  Distorting demand through its effects on consumption and investment, which both drags 
down and destabilizes short- and long-term growth in economic output  
 
Inequality obstructs the supply of talent, ideas, and capital 
 
The economic circumstances into which children are born affect children’s development in 
everything from their health to their ability to focus at school to their educational opportunities, 
and these, in turn, affect their economic outcomes as adults. Research by economists shows the 
links between factors such as children’s varying birth weights and their different levels of school 
performance, job-holding, and earnings as adults, relative to others with similar skillsets.  
 
Even when children have access to skills, inequality obstructs their contributing to the economy 
to the best of their abilities, and these obstructions hinder productivity and growth. Research led 
by Harvard’s Chetty measured what is more important to earning a patent later in life: scoring 
high on childhood aptitude tests or parental income. Disturbingly, the richer the family, the more 
likely the child will be to earn a patent—far outweighing demonstrated intelligence. If a child 
who shows aptitude early on cannot climb the income and wealth ladder, then there’s something 
broken in the way our economy works. Inequality has blocked the process and, as result, drags 
down national productivity by making our workforce less capable than it could be and our 
economy less innovative. 
 
Inequality subverts the institutions that manage the market 
 
Growing inequality is subverting the public institutions and the policymaking processes we need 
to support our economy. It discourages a focus on the public interest and promotes the efforts of 
firms to accrue larger profits than truly competitive markets would allow.  
 
Today, firms are able to manipulate the functioning of the marketplace because economic 
inequality gives their owners the financial wherewithal to wield political influence. By exerting 
pressure on political processes, they can minimize the taxes on firms, owners of capital, and top-
salaried workers. And they can rewrite laws and regulations in their favor. Research shows that 
lower taxes on those at the top of the income ladder do not lead to the kinds of beneficial 
outcomes some economists and policymakers suggest. The evidence is that when the rich pay 
less in taxes, it encourages them to act in unproductive ways. (See Figure 6.) 
 
Figure 6
 
 
When a firm has too much power in its product or services market, it has monopoly power, 
which means it can raise prices with impunity and stymie competition. Indeed, our economy is 
increasingly dominated by a few firms in many industries. In healthcare markets, the biggest 
healthcare companies are increasing their stronghold by merging and then charging higher 
prices, which, in turn, leads to higher profits for managers and shareholders alongside less 
affordable—and sometimes lower quality—healthcare for everyone else. It also means lower 
wages for those working increasingly in what economists call “monopsony labor markets,” 
where there’s only one or a handful of employers in a given market, giving these firms outsized 
wage-setting power. What’s happening in healthcare is emblematic of changes across our 
economy.  
 
By subverting our economy in various ways, inequality undermines confidence that institutions 
of governance can deliver for the majority. But for the economy to function, the public sector 
needs to function, and function well. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the U.S. government 
implemented policies that launched many families into prosperity with a solid financial 
foundation, including the Homestead Act, the estate tax, universal primary and secondary 
schools and land grant colleges across the nation, and the GI Bill. These policies weren’t perfect 
and were discriminatory in multiple ways, but they showed that the federal government could 
embark on big agendas to reduce inequality. Today, however, inequality in wealth and power is 
thwarting the government from taking on collective endeavors that provide the foundation for 
broad-based economic growth while promoting the interests of monopolists and oligopolists over 
others. 
 
Inequality distorts both consumption and investment 
 
Inequality distorts everyday decision-making by consumers and businesses. These outcomes are 
evident at the macroeconomic level. People’s spending drives business investment, as consumers 
account for nearly 70 cents of every dollar spent in the United States. But for the past several 
decades, U.S. families in the bottom half of the income distribution have seen no income gains, 
and the gains for those families not among the top 10 percent of income earners have been 
meager. This means that if firms were to invest more, they may not be able to sell additional 
goods and services because consumers might not be in positions to buy them.  
 
Many businesses, eyeing demand, have understandably not invested much over this period. U.S. 
firms are sitting on record-high piles of cash, which have been steadily accumulating since the 
1980s.12 Others have found customers willing to purchase their wares, but only because of the 
financially unstable expansion of household debt—as seen especially in the run-up to the Great 
Recession in the middle of the past decade, and as is occurring again today.13 Growing economic 
inequality thus destabilizes spending because everyday consumers either don’t have enough 
money to spend or are borrowing beyond their means to buy what they need. 
 
Inequality is even driving changes in what firms are producing, with a number of economic 
implications for innovation and even inflation. Xavier Jaravel at the London School of 
Economics finds that businesses are investing in new products targeted at high-end consumers 
while developing fewer products for those in the lower end of the market. For those at the low 
end, there’s less competition for their business, which means lower productivity, lower 
innovation, and higher prices and inflation. This shows up in the data: Jaravel found that between 
2004 and 2013, families with incomes greater than $100,000 per year saw yearly prices rise by 
0.65 percent less than for families earning below $30,000 in the respective bundles of goods that 
those families bought.  
 
With consumption dragged down by flagging middle-class incomes, too much money in the 
hands of those at the top, and investors sitting on the sidelines, conditions are ripe for an increase 
in the supply of credit. The deregulation of the financial sector over the past 40 years has made it 
easier to lend to U.S. households—in no small part due to the influence of the financial services 
industry. Empirical research and the U.S. experience over the past several decades show the 
consequences of these distortions and how credit-driven economic growth both increases 
economic instability and leads to lost economic opportunity.  
 
Conclusion: Measure who prospers when the economy grows 
 
Simon Kuznets knew that tracking GDP growth was not the endpoint for his National Income 
and Product Accounts. Much more needed to be done to ensure that the National Accounts were 
not just accounting tables but also could, in fact, say something meaningful about the well-being 
of American families. But despite some early progress toward adding a distributional component 
to the accounts in the 1950s, little changed over the next seven decades. It is time to fulfill this 
promise. Implementing GDP 2.0 will change our economic narrative and focus us on achieving 
broad-based growth. A new commitment to fighting inequality will, in turn, yield dividends for 
our economy.

*	The	views	expressed	here	are	my	own	and	do	not	represent	the	position	of	the	
American	Action	Forum.	I	am	indebted	to	my	colleague	Gordon	Gray	for	his	
invaluable	assistance.		
Introduction	
	
Chairman	Lee,	Vice	Chair	Maloney,	and	members	of	the	Committee,	I	am	honored	to	
have	the	opportunity	to	testify	on	the	state	of	the	science	of	measuring	income	
inequality	and	its	implications	for	public	policy.	Inequality	has	been	famously	
described	as	the	“defining	issue	of	our	time”	and	has	been	deployed	as	a	rationale	
for	significant	federal	policy	changes,	particularly	with	respect	to	taxation.	But	the	
casual	adoption	of	policies	on	the	basis	of	inequality	belies	the	serious	disagreement	
in	the	research	community	over	the	state	of	understanding	of	the	level	and	changes	
in	inequality.			
	
In	my	testimony,	I	wish	to	make	three	simple	points:	
	
•  There	is	no	consensus	in	the	research	literature	on	the	measurement	of	
inequality,	the	level	of	inequality,	or	recent	changes	in	inequality.	
	
•  Policies	predicated	on	specific	inequality	goals	therefore	suffer	from	critical	
flaws:	Advocates	cannot	accurately	describe	the	starting	point,	the	desired	
end	point,	or	the	benefits	and	costs	of	getting	from	here	to	there.	
	
•  Given	these	challenges	to	policies	designed	to	reduce	inequality,	lawmakers	
could	instead	focus	on	the	component	of	inequality-reduction	that	has	
uniform	support:	reducing	poverty	and	raising	the	standard	of	living	for	
working	Americans.		
	
Let	me	discuss	these	in	turn.	
	
Approaches	to	Measuring	Income	Inequality	
	
In	2003,	Drs.	Thomas	Piketty	and	Emmanuel	Saez	published	“Income	Inequality	in	
the	United	States,”	which	found	that	income	going	to	the	top	1	percent	nearly	
doubled	over	the	period	1979-1998.1	The	authors	have	since	updated	these	
findings,	which	present	still	higher	shares	of	income	accruing	to	the	“one	percent.”	
In	the	words	of	Vox,	“It’s	hard	to	overstate	the	influence	of	this	line	of	research.”2		
	
President	Obama	observed	that	inequality	was	the	“defining	issue	of	our	time”	in	a	
State	of	the	Union	address.	Reducing	inequality	for	its	own	sake	is	now	regularly	
cited	by	advocates	as	a	worthwhile	policy,	and	sweeping	generalizations	about	
inequality	pervade	the	public-policy	debate.	What	has	gotten	lost	is	a	critical	
evaluation	of	the	science	of	measuring	income	and,	by	extension,	income	inequality.	
A	serious	examination	of	that	research	reveals	that	despite	widespread	and	popular

historical	tax	rates,	for	example	–	there	is	no	expert	consensus	view	on	the	level	of,	
or	recent	changes	in,	income	inequality	in	the	United	States.3	That	observation	alone	
should	instill	some	humility	in	policymakers	in	pursuing	policies	designed	to	
address	inequality	for	its	own	ends.	Moreover,	it	is	also	the	case	that	the	estimates	
of	inequality	presented	by	the	authors	of	the	original	2003	study	and	its	subsequent	
iterations	are	outliers	in	the	literature.		
	
Before	examining	the	specifics	on	any	one	study,	it	is	important	to	think	about	the	
definition	of	income.	First,	popular	discussions	on	the	topic	of	inequality	frequently	
conflate	wealth	(the	stock	of	resources	owned)	and	income	(the	flow	of	resources	
over	a	specific	period).	
	
This	testimony	largely	focuses	on	measures	of	income	inequality.	Even	then,	
however,	there	are	a	wide	range	of	variations	in	what	is	measured	as	income.	
Studies	also	differ	with	respect	to	whose	income	is	measured.	Should	the	basic	unit	
of	analysis	be	a	household?	A	taxpayer?	Something	else?	Finally,	inflation	changes	
the	real	value	of	income	over	time,	and	how	it	is	accounted	for	affects	
measurements	of	income,	yet	there	is	divergence	here	as	well	over	how	to	control	
for	inflation.	On	top	of	these	problems	is	the	reality	that	the	data	are	imperfect,	and	
studies	use	different	sources	for	determining	individual	and	household	income.	
	
At	the	most	basic	level,	income	can	be	understood	as	cash	that	individuals	earn	or	
otherwise	receive	over	the	course	of	the	year.4	This	income	can	include	tips,	wages,	
interest,	and	any	number	of	other	form	of	receipts.	But	even	this	simple	definition	of	
income	becomes	complicated.	The	Congressional	Budget	Office	(CBO),	for	example,	
includes	in	labor	income:	“Cash	wages	and	salaries,	including	those	allocated	by	
employees	to	401(k)	plans;	employer-paid	health	insurance	premiums	(as	
measured	by	the	Current	Population	Survey);	the	employer’s	share	of	Social	
Security,	Medicare,	and	federal	unemployment	insurance	payroll	taxes;	and	the	
share	of	corporate	income	taxes	borne	by	workers.”5	This	definition	of	just	once	
source	of	income	involves	several	assumptions	and	assignments	–	and	is	
inextricably	linked	to	federal	policy.	Specifically,	this	definition	contemplates	payroll	
taxation,	corporate	taxation,	and	federal	entitlement	programs.		
	
This	basic	measure	is	already	quite	complex,	but	hardly	tells	the	whole	story	of	the	
economic	resources	that	can	accrue	to	individuals	and	households	over	the	course	
of	the	year.	Here,	researchers	often	diverge.	Some	researchers	define	income	as	pre-
tax.	Other	researchers	use	post-tax	measures.	Some	researchers	include	federal	cash	
transfer	programs	such	as	Social	Security	and	Unemployment	Insurance.	Still	others	
include	non-cash	transfer	programs	such	as	Supplemental	Nutrition	Assistance

income-2014.pdf 
5 Ibid.  
Program	benefits	(SNAP)	and	major	federal	health	programs.	Each	researcher	has	a	
rationale	for	the	inclusion	or	exclusion	of	these	additional	income	sources.	I	note	
them	here	to	highlight	that	there	are	very	real	technical	differences	among	income	
measures	that	should	caution	observers	about	the	reliance	on	any	one	measure.	As	
the	Urban	Institute’s	Stephen	Rose	observes,	“Simply,	there	is	not	methodological	
agreement	between	the	studies’	income	measures.”6	
	
With	each	additional	source	of	income,	researchers	must	rely	on	additional	sources	
of	data,	potentially	with	different	basic	units	of	analysis.	Some	studies	use	tax	units	
as	the	unit	of	analysis,	while	others	use	households.	In	addition,	some	studies	adjust	
for	household	size.	These	adjustments	can	have	a	significant	effect	on	a	household’s	
relative	position	on	the	income	scale.7	
	
To	the	extent	these	studies	report	on	income	trends	over	time,	they	must	control	for	
inflation.	Here,	researchers	again	diverge.	Some	researchers	use	standard	consumer	
price	index	(CPI-U-RS),	while	others	chose	to	use	the	personal	consumption	
expenditure	(PCE)	deflator.	The	key	distinction	is	that,	essentially,	the	use	of	the	
PCE,	all	else	equal,	will	tend	to	show	higher	income	growth	across	over	time,	as	
opposed	to	inflation,	than	the	CPI-U-RS.

Perhaps	the	most	remarkable	observation	about	the	original	Piketty	and	Saez	study	
is	that	its	core	finding	is	a	conspicuous	outlier.	This	observation	remains	true	when	
comparing	other	measurements	of	inequality	as	well,	such	as	share	of	income	
captured	by	higher	income	deciles	and	percentiles.	It	is	remarkable	that	when	the	
authors	embarked	on	a	new	measurement	of	inequality,	with	Dr.	Zucman	in	2018,	
they	found	that	median	incomes	over	the	period	1979-2014	was	41	percentage	
points	higher	than	that	of	their	original	finding.	This	departure,	stemming	from	
significant	methodological	changes	from	their	previous,	oft-cited,	work,	should	
suggest	some	humility	by	practitioners	regarding	the	policy-readiness	of	their	
findings.		
	
Indeed,	other	recent	work	offers	some	contrast	to	this	particular	strand	of	the	
literature.	Gerald	Auten	and	David	Splinter	found	that	“since	the	early	1960s,	
increasing	government	transfers	and	tax	progressivity	resulted	in	little	change	in	
after-tax	top	income	shares.”	This	finding	stands	in	contrast	to	even	the	more	recent	
Piketty,	Saez,	and	Zucman	(2018)	finding.	As	Auten	and	Splinter	note,	in	stark	
contrast	with	the	Piketty,	Saez,	and	Zucman	finding	“that	average	real	pre-tax	
incomes	of	the	bottom	50	percent	remained	virtually	unchanged,	we	estimate	that	
they	increased	by	nearly	one-third.	For	pre-tax/after-transfer	income	(which	
includes	Social	Security	benefits)	and	after-tax	income,	we	estimate	a	real	increase	
for	the	bottom	half	of	the	distribution	of	nearly	two-thirds.”	9		
	
What	explains	this	distinction?	As	the	authors	put	it,	“Tax	rules	and	incentives	for	
reporting	income	have	changed	over	time	as	the	result	of	tax	legislation.	Declining	
marriage	rates	and	changing	household	structures	can	lead	to	biased	results	when	
tax	units	are	the	unit	of	observation.	While	many	adults	do	not	file	tax	returns,	many	
returns	are	filed	by	individuals	under	age	20,	other	dependents,	and	non-residents.	
Important	sources	of	income	are	missing	in	tax	data,	including	government	transfer	
payments	and	non-taxable	employer-provided	benefits.	The	share	of	income	
missing	in	tax	data	has	increased	over	time,	such	that	market	income	on	tax	returns	
accounts	for	only	about	60	percent	of	national	income	in	recent	years.	In	addition,	
there	are	many	technical	issues	with	respect	to	differences	between	what	is	
reported	on	tax	returns	and	what	economists	regard	as	current-year	economic	
income.	Prior	studies	may	have	been	misleading	as	a	result	of	failure	to	adequately	
account	for	these	challenges.”	
	
Implications	for	Public	Policy	
	
The	state	of	inequality	presented	by	Piketty	and	Saez,	and	Piketty,	Saez,	and	Zucman	
has	become	conventional	wisdom	among	some	policymakers	and	animates	a	range	
of	policy	proposals.	In	general,	these	policies	appear	largely	unchanged	from	many	
progressive	policy	priorities;	they	simply	have	a	new	rationale	–	to	staunch	the	
growth	of	inequality.	But	this	line	of	reasoning	suffers	from	three	conceptual	flaws.	
First,	as	noted	above,	the	research	literature	has	nothing	like	a	consensus	on	income	
	
9 http://davidsplinter.com/AutenSplinter-Tax_Data_and_Inequality.pdf  
inequality.	Accordingly,	there	will	be	no	consensus	method	for	evaluating	policy	
changes	that	purport	to	“reduce	inequality.”	Indeed,	the	advocates	cannot	credibly	
state	what	the	current	level	of	inequality	is.	Perhaps	more	important,	advocates	for	
policies	focusing	on	inequality	cannot	articulate	what	a	“just”	level	of	inequality	
would	be.	Surely	it	can’t	be	the	case	that	everyone	should	have	exactly	the	same	
income.	Thus,	for	a	given	policy	to	reduce	inequality,	policy	advocates	cannot	
provide	a	credible	framework	for	evaluating	its	merit.		
	
As	part	of	their	respective	bids	for	the	presidency,	Senators	Warren	and	Sanders	
have	both	proposed	new	taxes	on	wealth.	While	there	are	some	differences	–	
Sanders’	proposal	has	a	higher	top	rate	–	the	basic	approach	is	the	same:	a	single-
digit	tax	on	the	reported	assets	of	households	with	net	worth	over	certain	threshold	
amounts.	Setting	aside	administrative	and	constitutional	challenges,	the	new	taxes	
suffer	from	key	design	flaws	if	viewed	through	a	conventional	efficiency	lens.		
	
While	the	candidates	couch	their	new	taxes	as	being	mere	cents	on	the	dollar,	the	
effective	rates	under	these	plans	are	quite	high.	In	essence,	these	annual	wealth	
taxes	amount	to	an	annual	tax	on	the	return	to	capital.	Senator	Warren	“would	levy	
a	2	percent	annual	tax	on	all	assets	—	including	stocks,	real	estate	and	retirement	
funds,	held	either	in	the	United	States	or	abroad	—	owned	by	households	with	a	net	
worth	of	$50	million	or	more.”10	It	would	add	an	additional	1	percent	“billionaire	
surtax”	on	households	with	net	worth	exceeding	$1	billion.	
	
If	the	rate	of	return	to	invested	wealth	is	5	percent,	a	3	percent	tax	on	the	2nd	billion	
dollars	(which	raises	$30	million)	is	the	same	as	a	60	percent	tax	on	the	$50	million	
of	earnings	(which	also	raises	$30	million).	Put	differently,	it	would	be	a	sharply	
higher	capital	income	tax	on	a	very	narrow	base.	Senator	Sanders	proposed	still	
higher	rates.	The	economic	implications	are	far	beyond	simply	making	certain	
households	worse	off.	The	notion	that	a	significant	fraction	of	the	economy’s	capital	
is	owned	by	these	households	means	that	a	significant	portion	of	the	capital	income	
will	face	highly	distortionary,	anti-growth	tax	rates.	The	implications	for	investment,	
innovation,	productivity	growth,	and	the	future	path	of	real	wages	should	be	well	
understood	before	contemplating	such	a	policy.		
	
An	Alternative	Approach	to	Inequality	
	
The	idea	that	the	economy	is	not	delivering,	and	has	not	delivered,	adequate	
outcomes	is	not	controversial.	The	CBO	projects	that	real	U.S.	economic	growth	will	
average	1.8	percent	over	the	next	10	years.	This	rate	of	growth	is	below	that	needed	
to	improve	the	standard	of	living	at	the	pace	typically	enjoyed	in	post-war	America.	
During	the	early	post-war	period,	from	1947	to	1969,	trend	economic	growth	rates	
were	quite	rapid.	Gross	domestic	product	(GDP)	and	GDP	per	capita	grew	at	rates	of	
4.0	percent	and	2.4	percent,	respectively.	Over	the	next	25	years,	however,	these	fell	
to	2.9	percent	and	1.9	percent,	respectively.	During	the	years	1986	to	2007,	trend	
	
10 https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/us/politics/wealth-tax-democrats.html  
growth	in	GDP	recovered	to	3.2	percent,	while	trend	GDP	per	capita	growth	rose	to	
2.0	percent.		
	
These	rates	were	quite	close	to	the	overall	historic	performance	for	the	period.	
These	distinct	periods	and	trends	should	convey	that	the	trend	growth	rate	is	far	
from	a	fixed,	immutable	economic	law	that	dictates	the	pace	of	expansion,	but	rather	
subject	to	outside	influences	—	including	public	policy.		
	
More	rapid	growth	is	not	an	abstract	goal;	faster	growth	is	essential	to	the	well-
being	of	American	families.

The	trend	growth	rate	of	post-war	GDP	per	capita	(a	rough	measure	of	the	standard	
of	living)	has	been	about	2.1	percent.	As	Table	1	indicates,	at	this	pace	of	expansion	
an	individual	could	expect	the	standard	of	living	to	double	in	30	to	35	years.	Put	
differently,	during	the	course	of	one’s	working	career,	the	overall	ability	to	support	
a	family	and	pursue	retirement	would	become	twice	as	large.		
	
In	contrast,	the	long-term	growth	rate	of	GDP	in	the	most	recent	CBO	projection	is	
1.8	percent.	When	combined	with	population	growth	of	1.0	percent,	this	long-term	
growth	rate	implies	the	trend	growth	in	GDP	per	capita	will	average	1.0	percent.	At	
that	pace	of	expansion,	it	will	take	70	years	to	double	income	per	person.	The	
American	Dream	is	disappearing	over	the	horizon.	
	
Rather	than	focusing	on	making	the	top	end	of	the	distribution	worse	off,	
policymakers	should	consider	a	robust	growth	agenda	for	raising	the	incomes	of	
those	at	and	near	the	bottom.	After	all,	every	dollar	of	successful	poverty	reduction	
reduces	inequality	and	benefits	the	most	deserving	in	the	population.	In	this	regard,	
it	is	worth	noting	that	because	the	income-inequality	measures	developed	by	
Piketty	and	Saez	and	Piketty,	Saez,	and	Zucman	do	not	include	certain	anti-poverty	
and	income	support	transfers,	no	amount	of	income	support	programs	would	alter	
their	estimates	of	inequality.

Prepared Testimony for Joint Economic Committee Hearing

Eric Zwick
I. Executive Summary
Chairman Lee, Ranking Member Maloney, and members of the Joint Economic Committee,
thankyoufortheopportunitytoappeartodaytodiscussmyresearchandlessonsformeasuring
economic inequality.
My name is Eric Zwick. I am currently Associate Professor of Finance in the Booth School
of Business at the University of Chicago and a Faculty Research Fellow in the programs on
PublicEconomicsandCorporateFinanceattheNationalBureauofEconomicResearch. Istudy
the interaction between public policy and corporate behavior, with a focus on taxation, ﬁscal
stimulus, and housing. A central goal of this work is to inform policy design where prior
knowledge is incomplete. In this research, in addition to working with academics at other
universities, I have collaborated with staff economists across the government, including in
the Treasury’s Ofﬁce of Tax Analysis (OTA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Research and
Statistics Division, the Federal Reserve, and the Congressional Budget Ofﬁce (CBO).
I will make three points today that I ﬁrst summarize here:
1. There is a signiﬁcant scientiﬁc consensus that inequality in America has risen, however
the academic literature is still learning about the causes of high end inequality. Speciﬁ-
cally, top inequality is more human-capital intensive than previously thought.
2. The state of the art on implementing distributional national accounts remains a work
in progress. The core issue is that distributional national accounts methods, especially
whenappliedtostudythetopoftheincomeandwealthdistributions,aresensitivetoim-
putationassumptions. Theseassumptionsareinmanycaseswelljustiﬁedanddefended.
But they necessarily rely on incomplete data and convenient simpliﬁcations. As a result,
alternativeassumptionscanbeequallyandinsomecasesbetterjustiﬁed,withsigniﬁcant
quantitative implications. It is also important to recall that what we observe in tax data
is inﬂuenced by reporting responses to changing tax rules over time.
3. While the academic literature remains somewhat divided on the technical speciﬁcs of
distributional accounts, these divisions are not philosophical or political. Rather they
reﬂectanincompletestateofcurrentknowledge. Istronglybelievethatwecanreconcile
these differences and continue to build toward a consensus method as time passes and

new data become available. My recommendations for a path forward are predicated on
this belief. These recommendations include having the experts at the BEA take on this
exercise, as well as several concrete suggestions for new information that can improve
distributional national accounts while also aiding tax enforcement.
Attheoutset,letmealsosaythatIadmireProfessorZucman’sworkdespiteouroccasional
friendly disagreements. I also have tremendous respect for the work of his colleagues Thomas
Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, who have been asking essential and fascinating questions about
economic growth and inequality and who have pioneered methods to answer these questions.
My work would not have been possible without theirs.
Furthermore, I want to be clear that my reading of the evidence is not that inequality in
America is low or that it has not increased at all. Rather my reading is that the increase has
been more modest and the nature of that increase—what factors contribute, who beneﬁts—
skews away from the passive capital highlighted in Piketty’s (2014) book and toward human
capital, labor, and entrepreneurial activity.
II. Top Inequality is More Human-Capital Intensive than Previously Thought
My research seeks to understand the nature of top income inequality and the drivers behind
its recent rise. As a ﬁrst step, I worked with Danny Yagan, Owen Zidar, and researchers at
the OTA and IRS to assemble new data from de-identiﬁed administrative tax records on the
population of businesses in the United States linked to their owners and workers. Our ﬁrst
paper documents the increasing role of pass-through businesses since the Tax Reform Act of
1986 and estimates the tax rate faced by different types of businesses in 2011. Though it may
seemanarcanetopic,theriseofpass-throughbusinesshasimplicationsforinterpretingtrends
in income inequality and economic measurement.1
Within the base of taxable income, nearly half of the rise since 1980 in the top 1% income
share comes from pass-through business, which includes the ordinary income earned by part-
nersinpartnershipsandtheproﬁtsofS-corporationowners(Figure1). InapaperwithYagan,
Zidar,andMattSmith,wepresentacomprehensiveanalysisofthenatureofthisincome,with
the goal of answering the question: how important is human capital at the top of the U.S. in-
comedistribution? Wedeﬁnehumancapitalbroadlytorefertoallfactorsembodiedinpeople,
including labor supply, networks, reputation, and rent-seeking ability.
Combining rich descriptive analysis with natural experiments, we ﬁnd that human capital,
asopposedtoﬁnancialcapital,remainscentraltorisingtopincomesintheUnitedStates. This

contrast, traditional C-corporations are taxed at the ﬁrm level and then again at the owner level if they receive
taxabledistributions.

Economic Measurement and the Distributional Accounts Zwick
ﬁnding depends crucially on how we think about pass-through income, which we estimate
to have a human capital share of 75%. When ignoring pass-through income, a minority of
top earners are human-capital rich. However, when deﬁning labor income comprehensively
to include that due to pass-through income, this assessment reverses: most top earners are
human-capitalrich,notﬁnancial-capitalrich(Figure2). Hence,thehumancapitalcomponent
of pass-through income transforms one’s view of the typical top earner.
This ﬁnding is bolstered by the basic facts that our new data reveal. Most top earners
are pass-through business owners—a group that includes consultants, lawyers, doctors, and
ownersoflargenon-publiclytradedbusinesses,suchasautodealersandwholesaledistributors.
In 2014, more than 69 percent of the top 1 percent of income earners and more than 84
percent of the top 0.1 percent of income earners accrued some pass-through business income.
In absolute terms, that amounts to more than 1.1 million pass-through owners with annual
incomesabove$390,000and140,000pass-throughownerswithannualincomesofmorethan
$1.6million. Inbothnumberandaggregateincome,thesegroupsfarsurpassthatoftoppublic
company executives, who have been the focus of much inequality commentary (Figure 3). In
termsofage,theymorecloselyresembletheworking-agedistributionoftopwageearnersand
not the older age distribution of top passive-capital-income earners (Figure 3).
III. The Tax Code Affects Economic Measurement
Another way of thinking about our results is that, while pass-through income is taxed as busi-
ness proﬁts, its underlying nature more closely reﬂects the labor income of business owners.
This fact underscores a more fundamental issue facing those who use tax data to measure
and study economic inequality. The nebulous boundary between labor and capital income,
especially among business owners who can ﬂexibly characterize their income to reduce tax,
introduces uncertainty into the data. When we compare data from different points in time
under different tax regimes, we must take into account how the tax code affects the income
being measured.
Forexample,whilewefoundthatthemajorityofthegrowthsince1990inentrepreneurial
income reﬂects real economic growth, a signiﬁcant share (approximately 30%) reﬂects busi-
nessesreorganizingtopass-throughform(Figure4). Thisreorganizationeffectoccursbecause
pass-through owners report income in pre-tax form, whereas C-corporation owners report in-
comeafterthecorporatetax. Itdoesnotrepresentarealincreaseinpre-taxincomeinequality.
In preliminary follow-on work, we also ﬁnd that tax-induced characterization of labor in-
come can account for as much as one-third of the decline in the corporate sector labor share
since the 1980s (Figure 5). In other words, neglecting how taxes inﬂuence income reporting

wouldleadustooverstatehowmucheconomicgrowthhasaccruedtocapitalinsteadoflabor.
The issue is even more severe when comparing data across countries. For example, in
many European countries (such as in France) where income inequality series based on tax
data imply low and stable inequality, closely-held private businesses are even more important
for economic activity than in the U.S. (Figure 6). These countries often have tax rules that
encourage business owners to keep income within the ﬁrm and off their personal tax returns.
Because of data limitations, research into how important this issue is for measuring inequality
is less advanced outside the U.S.
IV. Distributional Accounts Have Tremendous Potential
This brings me to distributional accounts, which Piketty, Saez, and Zucman (2018, henceforth
PSZ) developed to address this and other concerns with inequality measures derived from tax
data alone. The most important concern is that income distributions from tax data do not
fully capture the macroeconomic ﬂows in the national accounts, because much of national
income is not subject to personal tax. As mentioned above, the problem of missing income
retained in ﬁrms is “solved” with distributional acccounts, which use ownership information
to allocate this missing income to people. In principle, this approach can also help reconcile
estimates across years and countries. Beyond providing a full macroeconomically consistent
inequality series, the distributional accounts also attempt to measure both pre-tax and post-
tax-and-transfer distributions, which can be used to evaluate how government policy affects
inequality.
Recently,economistsattheFederalReservehavereleasedtheresultsofananalogousproject
that attempts to distribute national wealth. The Distributional Financial Accounts layer de-
tailed household wealth data from the Survey of Consumer Finances onto the ofﬁcial aggre-
gates in the U.S. Financial Accounts, thereby integrating two alternative data sets that can
teach us about wealth inequality. In addition, because the DFAs will be released quarterly
and in “near-real-time,” we can now study how wealth evolves into and out of recessions and
inform policymakers on the ﬂy.
These resources have tremendous potential to further our understanding of economic ac-
tivity. As an empirical researcher, I am always excited about the prospects of new data. But I
believe a timely and well done distributional accounts product would have value well beyond
the academic community.
It is worth noting that such series are most informative about inequality at a point in time,
relative to what they tell us about the distribution of growth. Studying the latter will require
panel data that allow us to follow the same people over time and adjust for life cycle forces

and temporary shocks.2
V.i. Distributional Accounts are a Work in Progress
In our investigation of human capital income, we implemented a full replication of Piketty,
Saez, and Zucman’s (2018, henceforth PSZ) distributional account series.3 In the process, we
established that our conclusions about the human-capital rich hold even after accounting for
this broader notion of income, which includes capital income missing from tax data.
This work has given me insight into the state of the art on implementing distributional
nationalaccounts. ThemethodsintheSaezandZucman(2016,SZ)andPSZpapersarebased
on strong assumptions that entail signiﬁcant uncertainty, which could be made more salient.
For example, PSZ’s approach has been questioned in a recent paper by Gerald Auten at OTA
and David Splinter at the Joint Committee for Taxation (JCT) (henceforth AS), who bring to
thetaskanintimateawarenessofthetaxdataandrelevantlegislativehistory. ASalsoattempt
to construct distributional accounts, motivated as an improvement to the CBO’s measures of
broadmarketincome. ThetakeawayfromtheASpaperisstillthatincomeinequalityhasrisen,
but the trend is less dramatic than in the PSZ series (Figure 7).
Why the difference between these papers? The speciﬁc details are fairly technical, but
the core issue is that distributional national accounts, especially when applied to study the
top of the income distribution, are very sensitive to imputation assumptions. The methods
take components of national income not on tax returns and make educated guesses about
who owns what. PSZ’s imputation assumptions for capital income depend on SZ’s method for
estimatingtopwealth—theyusethesewealthestimatestoallocateunobservedcapitalincome.
AS use a different approach: they combine surveys, tax data, and data from other sources to
allocate this income. My reading of this back and forth is that PSZ’s assumptions are in many
caseswelljustiﬁedanddefended. Buttheynecessarilyrelyonincompletedataandconvenient
simplifyingassumptions. Asaresult,alternativeassumptionscanbeequallyandinsomecases
better justiﬁed, with signiﬁcant quantitative implications.
A new paper with Smith and Zidar uses our data to reﬁne the wealth estimates of SZ and
study implications for income and wealth taxation. This paper is still a work-in-progress, so
the numbers are preliminary. We believe the conclusions are robust, but are still working to
reconcile our ﬁndings and address questions Saez and Zucman have raised.

on tax returns to estimate wealth. This approach relies upon having an accurate mapping
of income to wealth, or equivalently knowing the rates of return earned on different types
of income by different groups of people. Currently, their estimates deploy the simplifying
assumption for converting income ﬂows to wealth that everyone gets the same return within
an asset class. In contrast to recent estimates of wealth concentration based on the Survey
of Consumer Finances or estate tax data, which show high levels of wealth concentration and
modestincreases,SZ’sestimatesshowrapidlyincreasingconcentrationinrecentyears(Figure
8). They also show that ﬁxed income wealth rapidly increased as a share of top portfolios, in
contrast to the portfolio composition revealed in other data sets.
Several studies have raised concerns about these estimates, in particular, arguing that the
equal returns assumption can bias wealth estimates toward the top when top wealth holders
actually earn higher returns than average. Kopczuk (2015) suggests these adjustments are
especially important when average returns are close to zero, such as was the case for interest
rates in the wake of the Great Recession. Other papers, especially Bricker, Henriques and
Hansen (2018) and Fagereng, Guiso, Malacrino and Pistaferri (2016), also emphasize that
higher returns at the top affect these wealth estimates.
We follow these authors and consider the effect of allowing returns to differ across people.
We draw on new data from a variety of sources to discipline our approach. We also correct
for bias at the geographic level, which allows us to produce wealth estimates by state and
metropolitan area. Our preliminary ﬁndings reveal that wealth concentration is lower and
more dependent on private business ownership than previously thought (Figure 8). We stress
thatourresultsdonotimplythatwealthconcentrationisloworirrelevantfromapolicymaker’s
perspective: the top 1% in our preferred series has as much wealth as the bottom 90%.
Overall, we view our work as helping to clarify how capitalization works in practice, to
emphasize the quantitative importance of relaxing the equal returns assumption, and to make
more salient the uncertainty that remains. Acknowledging the uncertainty in current practice,
the sensitivity to speciﬁc assumptions, and the need for additional data are especially impor-
tant as statistical agencies consider adopting this approach to produce distributional national
accounts (Figure 9).
Last, and this is really important, if SZ’s wealth estimates are biased, this will bias their
distributional income estimates. And if their distributional income estimates are biased, this
willbiastheirestimatesofaveragetaxratesalongtheincomedistribution. Splinterhasrecently
raisedconcernsaboutthesetaxrates,whichlargelycorrespondtoconcernsaboutdistributional
income estimates. It is important to keep in mind that, despite this debate about the current
level of progressivity, there is nearly unanimous agreement that the tax-and-transfer system
has become less progressive over the past few decades.

V.ii. Additional Discussion
For the interested reader, I summarize four important outstanding issues in producing distri-
butional accounts:
1. Underreported income. There is a large gap between pass-through income in PSZ dis-
tributional national income and in ﬁscal income, despite the fact that in principle all
of this income should appear on tax returns. This gap owes primarily to the allocation
of underreported income included in proprietors’ income in the national accounts. AS
identify this factor as the most important difference between their estimate of the top
1% share and imputed national income in PSZ.
2. Retained earnings. PSZ allocate the household share of aggregate retained earnings to
individuals in proportion to the sum of the individual’s observed dividends and realized
capital gains. The rationale is that when C-corporation income does appear on personal
tax returns, it appears as either dividends or realized capital gains. However, published
IRSreportsindicatethatatleast25%andasmuchas75%ofrealizedcapitalgainsarenot
from the sale of C-corporate stock and are instead gains from real estate and other asset
salesorcarriedinterest. Realizedcapitalgainsaremuchlargerthandividendsandmuch
moreconcentratedamongtopearners. Hence,imputingretainedearningsinproportion
to each individual’s sum of dividends and 100% of realized capital gains likely allocates
too much retained earnings to the top.
3. Pensions. AS also raise concerns about the use of certain nontaxable pension distribu-
tions,whichtheyarguereﬂectpensionaccountrollovers. Becausetheserolloverscapture
the entire value of retirement accounts, they should not be mixed with taxable pension
ﬂows when being used to infer pension wealth and to allocate missing pension income.
4. Fixed income. The largest component of non-business capital income that differs from
ﬁscal income and contributes to top 1% growth is interest income. With distributional
nationalincomeranks,thetaxableinterestseriesissubstantiallylowerthantheimputed
nationalincomeseriesandfellasashareofnationalincomeinrecentdecades. Ibelieve
this is related to concerns about SZ’s approach to estimating ﬁxed income wealth.
VI. A Fact-Finding Mission is a Clear, High-Payoff Step Forward
While the academic literature remains somewhat divided on the technical speciﬁcs of distri-
butional accounts, these divisions are not philosophical or political. Rather they reﬂect an
7
Economic Measurement and the Distributional Accounts Zwick
incomplete state of current knowledge. I strongly believe that we can reconcile these differ-
ences and continue to build toward a consensus method as time passes and new data become
available. My recommendations for a path forward are predicated on this belief.
First, the academic literature will continue to make progress, but it is not too early to pro-
pose that the experts at the BEA, who have intimateknowledge of what goes into the national
incomeaccounts, takeontheexerciseaswell. Indoingso, Iexpecttheywillrelyonthemeth-
ods proposed by both PSZ and AS, along with other contributions to this debate. It would be
natural for the BEA to follow a process similar to that of the Federal Reserve, which would in-
cludedevelopingestimates,preparingatechnicalreport,anddistributingandpresentingtheir
ﬁndings to solicit feedback from the broader community.
Second, several outstanding areas of disagreement could be assessed through improved
information reporting and collection. Requiring partnerships and closely held C-corporations
to trace and report their ultimate owners would aid the production of distributional accounts
and help improve tax enforcement.4
Third, expanding the IRS random audit programs, whose estimates form the basis of as-
sumptions about the distribution of underreported income, would be extremely valuable.
Fourth, improving data collection on retirement account balances could help the BEA allo-
cate undistributed pension income.
Of course, such additional information reporting requirements entail compliance and pri-
vacy costs that must be weighed in deciding whether they are worthwhile.
VII. Conclusions
A better understanding of the facts about inequality is important because we want to narrow
thesetofpolicyinstrumentstothosemostlikelytowork. Thelistofpotentialsolutionsislong
and diverse, including those that target the top—such as taxes on wealth and high incomes,
regulationofindustry,charitable-givingreforms,andrestrictionsonpoliticalcontributionsand
lobbying—and those that target the bottom—such as direct transfers, support for public edu-
cation,affordablehousingpolicy,andotherexpansionstothesafetynet. Whetheraparticular
policy will have the desired effect depends on whether we correctly target the root causes and
worst consequences of inequality.
Therefore, a clear next step is to continue the kind of fact-ﬁnding mission taking place
here today. This committee could facilitate a substantive conversation about the following
questions:
4Partnership ownership is especially opaque: in Cooper et al, we estimate that 20% of the income goes to
unclassiﬁablepartners,and15%oftheincomeisearnedincircularlyownedpartnerships.

• What do we know about why inequality has risen?
• What role have demographic shifts and changes in the structure of the pension system
played in measuring these trends?
• What are the consequences for disparities in economic opportunity, especially for chil-
dren?
• What is the relative importance of multi-generational wealth as opposed to self-made
wealth?
• What are the effects of inequality on the distribution of political inﬂuence?
• And is wealth inequality related to income inequality, for which human capital plays a
signiﬁcant role, or do wealth inequality trends represent a distinct phenomenon?
Afact-ﬁndingmissionwouldservethreepurposes. First,itwouldhelpinformpolicymakers
and the public, moving everyone toward a common set of facts. Second, it would shed light
on which policy ideas best suit the problem. Third, it would inject needed humility into the
debate, given our current incomplete state of knowledge.
Thank you for your time and consideration of my testimony.

CONGRESSWOMAN CAROLYN B. MALONEY  
Hearing of the Joint Economic Committee 
Measuring Economic Inequality in the United States 
Prepared Remarks 
Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney, Vice Chair 
October, 16, 2019 
 
Last month, the Census Bureau reported that income inequality in the United States, by one 
measure, had reached its highest level since they began tracking it more than 50 years ago. 
 
For the typical worker, wages have been stagnant for four decades. 
 
On the other hand, those at the top are doing great.   
 
The top 1 percent of households in the United States now take home about 20 percent of the total 
income. 
 
The wealthiest 1 percent own nearly 40 percent of total wealth.   
 
Those at the very top – the top one-tenth of one percent – have seen their share of wealth double 
since 1990. 
 
That narrow sliver of the population – the top tenth of one percent – now own more than the 
bottom 80 percent of Americans. 
 
One of our witnesses today, Dr. Gabriel Zucman, has done important work tracking these trends 
going back a century. 
 
His most recent work looks at the role played by our tax system. 
 
It is widely believed that our tax system is progressive – that the rich pay a larger percentage of 
their income in taxes.  
 
However, Dr. Zucman’s recent work reveals that in 2018 the wealthiest 400 Americans paid a 
lower tax rate than any other income group. 
 
Sadly, this is not an accident – it is deliberate public policy. 
 
In 2017, the Republican Congress and President Trump slashed taxes on the rich…. 
…. Borrowing $1.9 trillion to do it.  
 
Inequality in America was already sky high.  
 
The Republican tax cuts made it far worse. 
 
Skyrocketing inequality undermines our middle-class society, in which anyone who works hard 
has a chance to succeed. 
Page 1 
 
It means that for millions of Americans, the American dream may be a myth. 
 
Our second witness, economist Heather Boushey, argues that high levels of inequality undermine 
economic growth… 
 
….because strong growth depends in part on a strong middle class. 
 
Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of the U.S. economy. 
 
But as a larger and larger share of income and wealth go to those at the top, there is less left over 
for everyone else. 
 
As a result, most Americans have less money in their pockets, less to spend on what businesses 
sell.    
 
Therefore, when the bottom 50 percent – those who consume a much larger share of income 
compared to those at the top – see no income growth for 40 years, that’s a major problem.   
 
Extreme inequality also undermines our communities.  
 
The Chairman and I agree that healthy communities with strong “social capital” are critical to a 
high quality of life. 
 
But extreme inequality undermines that. 
 
When wealth is highly concentrated and in a society where education is critical to success, 
families have extremely high incentives to live in towns with other wealthy families, so they can 
put their children in the best school systems. 
 
So, Americans increasingly become segregated by wealth and their quality of life becomes 
dependent on their zip code. 
 
Extreme inequality also undermines our democratic institutions. 
 
It enables the powerful to rig the rules – to make themselves even more powerful. 
 
We see the erosion of antitrust laws, the breakdown of protections for small investors, the 
rejection of overtime protections for workers. 
 
We pay a very high price for extreme inequality. 
 
How bad is inequality in the United States? 
 
Economists disagree about the severity of the problem.    
 
Page 2 
 
But while they disagree about how much inequality has worsened in recent decades, there is little 
disagreement…. 
 
….things are getting worse. 
 
One way that we measure the strength of our economy is by quarterly measures of gross 
domestic product. It is a good, aggregate number – it tells us how fast the whole economic “pie” 
is growing. 
 
But the “slices” of the pie that go to the rich, middle class and poor are extremely unequal.  
 
Unfortunately, we currently don’t measure how economic growth is shared. 
 
For this reason, I have introduced the Measuring Real Income Growth Act.  And I’m pleased that 
Senator Heinrich is again introducing a companion bill in the Senate. 
 
The bill would require the Bureau of Economic Analysis to report GDP growth by income decile 
and the top one percent alongside the topline number.  
 
It will help us understand not just how fast the economy is growing but who is benefiting from 
that growth.   
 
Academic economists, such as Dr. Zucman, have produced estimates similar to those we are 
asking for from BEA.  But we need the government to do this is in a regular and timely manner. 
 
Inequality is one of the most pressing issues of our day. It is tearing our society apart and 
undermining much of what we stand for. 
 
In order to understand inequality, we must have better ways to measure it – ways that are 
accepted by those on both sides of the aisle. 
 
With that information in hand, we can begin to restore our country to the land of opportunity.

Opening Statement  
JEC Hearing on “Measuring Economic Inequality in the United States” 
October 16, 2019, 2:15pm 
2020 Rayburn House Office Building 
 
Thank you, Vice Chair Maloney, for calling this hearing. 
Inequality has been a hinge of American politics, and indeed in all 
democracies, for as long as there have been democracies. And with good 
reason. The concentration of economic power can be as dangerous as the 
concentration of political power. 
Unfortunately, the debate about inequality – like many debates these days 
– can be easily swept up into a partisan exercise of talking past each other. 
We could spend our entire time today haggling over whether “inequality” is 
best understood as unequal opportunity, or unequal outcomes.  
Or indeed, if the latter, we could argue for hours about whether and how 
much it is even a problem, given that almost every facet of modern life – 
from air conditioning to airplanes – can be counted among the blessings of 
the intentionally unequal benefits of free enterprise.  
Inequality is such a large concept that it is impossible to tackle in a single 
hearing. That is why I commend the Vice-Chair for organizing today’s 
hearing on “measuring” inequality. And for inviting an excellent panel of 
witnesses who can help us navigate the issue. 
The subject of data measurement techniques is at once narrow enough to 
keep our discussion focused, and – hopefully – technical enough that even 
Congress can set aside political temptations and simply drill down on some 
important questions. 
For instance: 
  1 
-  How should we define “income” for purposes of measuring 
inequality between rich, poor, and middle class? 
 
-  How should we count government transfers - like the Earned 
Income Tax Credit – for lower-income workers? 
 
-  As the scholarship on inequality measurement has progressed, 
which technical details have survived peer-review scrutiny, and 
which remain to be worked out before we can reach academic 
consensus? 
These are not the questions that will lead cable news political talk shows. 
That’s why they are exactly the kind the Joint Economic Committee should 
be taking up. Even the best policies involve tradeoffs.  
Our economy is growing, and today employs more people than ever before. 
But it has been a long slog out of the Great Recession, much longer for 
some than others. 
If the data really can afford us a clearer view of how the costs and benefits 
of economic growth are being experienced up and down the income scale, 
that is analysis we should all insist on getting… and insist on getting right. 
Thank you again Madam Vice-Chair, and to the witnesses for being here 
today. I look forward to your testimony and our discussion.  
I yield back.

GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA: 
UNDERSTANDING AND REDUCING THE COSTS 
OF FIREARM INJURIES AND DEATHS 
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2019 
UNITED STATES CONGRESS, 
JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE, 
Washington, DC. 
The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:21 p.m., in Room 
210,  Cannon  House  Office  Building,  the  Honorable  Carolyn  B. 
Maloney, Vice Chair, presiding. 
Representatives present: Maloney, Schweikert, Beyer, Beatty,

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY, VICE 
CHAIR, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM NEW YORK 
Vice Chair Maloney. The meeting will be called to order, and 
I thank all of my colleagues for joining me. And thank you to the 
moms, and everybody else that is here for this important hearing. 
And certainly we thank all of our panelists. 
I especially want to thank the witnesses, some of whom have lost 
family members to gun violence. And as we talk about the costs of 
gun violence, let us never forget that the biggest, most tragic cost 
of all is the loss of a human life. 
I believe that Congress must act to stem the gun violence epi-
demic in our country. In 2017 alone, almost 40,000 people were 
killed by guns in the United States. Firearms are now the leading 
cause of death in young people. Our gun homicide rate for teens 
and young adults is nearly 50 times higher than other high-income 
countries. And 90 percent of all the women killed by firearms in 
high-income countries are killed in the United States. 
In August alone, more than 50 lives were taken in a series of 
horrible  massacres.  So  far  this  year  there  have  been  301  mass 
shootings. That is more than one per day. And yet, unbelievably, 
some people say that the real problem here is that we do not have 
enough guns. They say that the only thing that will make America 
safer is more guns. But the fact of the matter is if guns made us

safer, we would be the safest Nation on Earth, and we are far, far 
from it. 
In the United States there are more guns in civilian hands than 
in any other country in the world. An American is seven times 
more likely than someone in Canada to die from a gun, eight times 
more likely than someone in France, and almost 20 times more 
likely than a person in Germany, and almost 40 times more likely 
than someone in the U.K., Australia, or New Zealand, and nearly 
200 times more than someone in Japan, where they do not have 
guns, the police do not even carry guns, and they have had zero 
deaths  from  guns  in  their  country.  More  people  in  the  United 
States died from firearm-related injuries from 2003 to 2012 than 
the entire number of combat fatalities in World War II. That is an 
astonishing statistic. 
There is no way to estimate the cost of a human life. The loss 
is absolutely—you cannot determine what the cost is. But there is 
also economic cost: a lost breadwinner’s income, astronomical med-
ical  costs,  costs  to  employers,  schools,  police,  hospitals,  and  the 
criminal justice system. In order to help people better understand 
those costs, I have asked my staff to produce a report that compiles 
data on the economic cost of gun violence in all 50 States. And the 
report finds that rural States have the highest gun violence meas-
ured as a share of their economies. 
States with high rates of gun ownership have the highest rates 
of gun suicide. The three largest States suffer the largest absolute 
costs, and the high youth death rates from gun violence extend 
across regions. In contrast, my home State of New York, which has 
stricter gun laws, including an assault weapons ban, has one of the 
three lowest costs of gun violence as a share of its economy, along 
with Hawaii and Massachusetts. 
There are three people in this room today who have suffered 
heart-wrenching losses as a result of gun violence. One of our wit-
nesses, Tina Meins, lost her father in the mass shootings in San 
Bernardino, California, in 2015. Dr. Suzanna Hupp, who also is 
testifying, lost both her parents in a mass shooting at a restaurant 
in Texas in 1991. And Shenee´ Johnson from New York, seated in 
the first row, lost both a fiance and her son to gun violence. We 
must fight to lower the risks so that other families are not forced 
to bear such suffering. 
Other countries have drastically reduced gun violence because 
they found the courage to act. In Australia in 1996, after a man 
with an assault rifle killed 35 people, the parliament responded by 
banning automatic and semiautomatic weapons, and created a buy- 
back program that resulted in over 650,000 weapons being turned 
in. In New Zealand in 2019, after 51 people were killed in the 
Christchurch mosque, the parliament acted quickly, voted nearly 
unanimously to outlaw automatic and semiautomatic weapons. 
That is the kind of leadership that the U.S. Congress has lacked 
for many years. In fact, in 1996, the Congress of the United States 
made matters worse. It passed legislation that effectively blocked 
all Federal funding for gun violence research at the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. 
I would say that there is no issue that cannot be discussed and 
debated and studied, and the fact that this was blocked is out-

rageous. It was changed recently, and that is important, but we 
have gone more than 20 years without deepening our knowledge 
about gun violence prevention and about what we can do to end 
this epidemic. We do so much research on cars and how to make 
them safer. We should be doing the same type of research with 
guns. 
This year the Democratic House acted to address this crisis. We 
passed the first gun safety reforms in 25 years. The bill requires 
universal background checks, closes the gun show loophole, and 
gives the FBI more time to conduct lifesaving background checks. 
This summer the House passed another bill, one that I have spent 
years fighting for, to invest millions, $50 million, to conduct re-
search on how to reduce gun violence. And last week the House Ju-
diciary Committee sent to the full House a ban on high-capacity 
magazines, red flag legislation, and a bill to prohibit those who 
commit misdemeanor hate crimes from obtaining a gun. 
These  are  common-sense  measures  that  the  vast  majority  of 
Americans strongly support. It is time for change. I look forward 
to a day when our children do not have to be afraid to go to school, 
when  our  teachers  do  not  have  to  treat  gunshot  wounds,  when 
nearly half of Americans are not worried about being a victim in 
a mass shooting, and when those who hold the reins of power move 
forward beyond hollow offers of thoughts and prayers. 
Let us honor the victims of gun violence and their families by 
working to prevent more victims. Let us, like other countries in the 
developed world, turn tragedy into bold action. And may all Mem-
bers of Congress, especially those in the Senate, find the courage 
to act. Their inaction is literally costing lives. And I look forward 
to our witnesses’ testimony this afternoon. 
Before I turn to our distinguished Chairman for his comments, 
I just want you to look at this chart. The red line is the United 
States and you can see how that compares to the gun violence in 
other countries, some of which is zero. But the next country is Can-
ada that is similar to ours. There is a lot of gun violence in those 
countries that are having civil wars, but even there, their gun vio-
lence is less than what we have in the United States. 
Anyway, thank you all  for coming, and  thank you, Chairman 
Lee, for allowing this hearing. Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Vice Chair Maloney appears in the 
Submissions for the Record on page 32.]

SENATOR FROM UTAH 
Chairman Lee. Thank you, Vice Chair Maloney. And I join you 
in thanking our witnesses for coming today, and thanking those, 
some of whom are witnesses and some of whom are in the audi-
ence, who have endured firsthand the grieving loss associated with 
gun violence. 
Over  the  past  few  weeks,  Americans  have  watched  in  horror 
again and again as our fellow beings, young and old, have been 
murdered in high-profile mass shootings on American soil. As law-
makers, it is not enough for us to grieve with them, although we 
certainly do. It is our responsibility first to understand what might 
be causing these horrific events, as well as the many other tragic

deaths that are the result of gun violence that take place in our 
country every year. 
And then it is our responsibility to find policies that may help 
prevent tragedies like these in the future, so long as these policies 
are faithful to the Constitution and so long as they do not inadvert-
ently harm the very citizens that they are supposed to protect. 
Mass shootings, of course, attract our attention for a number of 
reasons, including the fact that they have the ability to inspire 
great fear. When innocent people get gunned down at random in 
public, it makes us wonder. It makes us think, will I be next? Will 
my child be next? Will my spouse, my mother, my father, be next? 
And our media, obsessed with their click and count viewership, 
shamelessly too often choose to fan those fears rather than to por-
tray the truth about the terrible problem of gun violence in this 
country. Studies have suggested that this irresponsible media cov-
erage, and I do not hesitate in calling it irresponsible and morally 
bankrupt, may actually increase the number of mass shootings by 
encouraging potential killers in their sick desire for attention. 
The reality of gun violence in America is less sensational than 
that what we see in the media, but no less horrible. Six in 10 gun 
deaths are suicides. In 2017, for every victim of a mass shooting, 
there were 88 victims of gun suicide, and another 52 victims of an-
other form of gun homicide. 
Mental illness, spiritual emptiness, and a breakdown of the fam-
ily and community life are at the heart of the underlying causes 
of much of our gun violence epidemic, including even mass shoot-
ings. Mass shooters seek to inflict on others the pain, the fear, the 
inner torment that they are already suffering themselves. 
They too often come from broken homes and distressed neighbor-
hoods. The Joint Economic Committee’s Social Capital Project has 
ranked American counties by the health of family and community 
life, and has found that half of identified mass shooters came from 
the bottom quarter of counties. 
The evil committed by these murderers must be stopped. In order 
to do that, we have to seek to uproot its causes. Millions of law- 
abiding citizens use guns to protect themselves and their families 
and  their  communities,  just  as  our  founding  document  protects 
them in their right to do that, and just as our Founding Fathers 
intended. 
The Constitution protects our right to bear arms because if that 
right were abridged, we would become more dependent for security 
on our police and on our military, necessary but limited and finite 
resources. And it is no criticism of our police and our military to 
say that this would ultimately make us less secure as a people— 
less secure, not more. 
Some Americans have suffered tragedy precisely when they were 
prevented their right to bear arms, as we will soon hear from the 
personal story of Dr. Suzanna Hupp, who is here to share that 
story with us today. Dr. Suzanna Hupp met this firsthand and can 
identify the infringement of her right as being connected to the 
tragedy that she suffered. 
And when we do enact gun control laws, we know that criminals 
are in many instances all too happy and eager and willing and able 
to ignore them. One study found that 79 percent of guns recovered

from crime scenes were possessed unlawfully. This does not mean 
that we do not have any ways to keep guns out of the hands of 
criminals in America, and especially the mentally ill. 
Our State governments have proposed several worthwhile inno-
vations, including those that make it easier for local law enforce-
ment to act swiftly on reports of suspicious activities that often pre-
cede mass shootings. There is room for reform in our Federal stat-
utes as well. For example, we could improve local agencies report-
ing to our National Instant Criminal Background Check System for 
firearms purchases. 
Many Americans, including some of our witnesses, have borne in 
their own lives the unspeakable, unbearable costs of gun violence. 
It is important for Congress to listen to their voices. I hope that 
this committee can present to the rest of the country a model of 
respectful conversation about some very difficult topics so that we 
can  work  together  to  reduce  the  number  of  lives  tragically  and 
needlessly lost to gun violence. 
Madam Vice Chair, I have just been informed they have called 
some votes in the Senate. There are a couple of us who are in the 
Senate who will have to bounce back and forth. And I appreciate— 
thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Chairman Lee appears in the Sub-
missions for the Record on page 33.] 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you. Thank you for your testimony. 
And people will be leaving to vote. And Senator Hassan, I want to 
recognize that you are here. 
But we now are going to our panelists. Tina Meins is a gun vio-
lence survivor and a member of the Everytown Survivor Network. 
Her father, Damian Miens, was shot and killed by one of his co-
workers during the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, 
in 2015; 14 people were killed in the attack. And since then she 
has advocated for changes to our gun laws. She was a guest at 
President Obama’s 2016 State of the Union address. She recently 
completed her graduate degree from the McCourt School of Public 
Policy at Georgetown University. 
Adam Skaggs is chief counsel and policy director at the Giffords 
Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Before joining Giffords in 
2016, Mr. Skaggs was a senior counsel at Everytown for Gun Safe-
ty, where he led their litigation efforts. He previously served as 
senior  counsel  at  the  Brennan  Center  for  Justice.  He  also  has 
worked as a law clerk to Judge Stanley Marcus. He has a J.D. from 
Brooklyn Law School. 
Suzanna  Hupp  served  as  a  Republican  member  of  the  Texas 
House of Representatives from 1997 to 2007. Dr. Hupp is a sur-
vivor of the Luby’s Cafeteria mass shooting in Killeen, Texas, in 
1991, where 24 people, including both of her parents, were killed. 
Dr. Hupp has spoken across the country in support of concealed 
handgun  laws,  and  wrote  a  book  about  her  experience  entitled, 
‘‘From Luby’s to the Legislature: One Woman’s Fight Against Gun 
Control.’’  She  attended  the  University  of  Texas  in  El  Paso  and 
Texas Chiropractic College. 
John R. Lott, Jr., is president of the Crime Prevention Research 
Center, which conducts research on the relationship between laws 
regulating the ownership or use of guns, crime, and public safety.

STATEMENT OF MS. TINA MEINS, MEMBER, EVERYTOWN 
SURVIVOR NETWORK, WASHINGTON, DC 
Ms. Meins. Good morning, Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Maloney, 
and members of the Joint Economic Committee. It is an honor to 
appear before you to testify on the important topic of gun violence 
in America. My name is Tina Meins and I live in Washington, D.C., 
but I grew up in California. Today I am here as a daughter, a sis-
ter, a fiancee, and a recent graduate from McCourt School of Public 
Policy at Georgetown University. 
Today I represent the 58 percent of Americans who have said 
they or someone they care for has experienced gun violence in their 
lifetime. I am here in honor of my father, Damian Meins, who was 
shot and killed. He was my travel buddy and my best friend, and 
today I am my father’s voice. 
My dad, mom, sister, and I were all extremely close. He was in-
telligent, hardworking, had a great sense of humor, and loved to 
make people laugh. He lived his life in service to others. It did not 
matter if he was mowing a neighbor’s lawn, helping a friend move, 
or taking care of a sick relative. He was always generous with his 
time. He loved his family deeply, and our lives have not been the 
same since he was taken. 
I  will  never  forget  the  shock,  panic,  and  heartbreak  when  I 
learned my dad was killed, along with 13 of his coworkers, on De-
cember 2, 2015, in San Bernardino, California. That day my dad, 
Damian, was attending a mandatory work training event for the 
San Bernardino County Department of Public Health at the Inland 
Regional Center. 
My dad was standing by the Christmas tree during a break when 
another coworker and his wife, who had pledged allegiance to the 
terrorist group ISIS, burst through the doors and began shooting. 
In seconds, my dad was shot five times, and his life was over. 
There are no words to express the profound loss we experienced 
with my dad’s death. As for the economic impact, our family had 
access to financial support because the shooting occurred during a 
work event and was also deemed a terrorist attack. We received 
critical resources from workers’ compensation funds, life insurance, 
and the victim compensation fund. 
Additionally, the Nation came together, and many people were 
incredibly kind and generous enough to donate to the victims of the 
San Bernardino attacks through different GoFundMe efforts. With 
these funds, we were able to hold the funeral for my father and

make sure his family could attend. However, because of the com-
plex laws surrounding taxation of these varying types of monies, 
my mother has also faced ongoing IRS issues since 2016. 
She cites lost future earnings from my dad as the biggest finan-
cial burden, but points out that this cannot in any way compare to 
the emotional toll of losing your high school sweetheart and hus-
band of 36 years in such a horrific fashion. 
I was fortunate that my own workplace at the time was very sup-
portive and allowed me to stay off work for two months. However, 
I had to use all my bereavement, sick time, and vacation time, and 
after that was exhausted, I went unpaid in order to be with my 
family as we grieved. 
Unfortunately, most Americans who experience gun violence do 
not have the same access to financial support and donations or 
flexibility with their employment to pick up the pieces when their 
lives are shattered by a bullet. Although my dad did not survive 
the shooting on December 2nd, there were dozens of people who 
did, and still bear the emotional and physical scars. 
I have permission to share the experience of Julie, who is special 
to my family because she was able to relay the last seconds of my 
dad’s life to us. She was actually standing next to him, next to the 
Christmas tree, when the shooting occurred. 
Julie was 50 years old at the time of the shooting. She was shot 
twice, and has had five surgeries that have left her with significant 
scar tissue, causing problems of its own. She has a tremendous 
amount of bullet fragmentation still left in her body, and will for-
ever be concerned about lead poisoning. 
Though Julie loved her job and her coworkers, the shooting effec-
tively ended her career, and she was never able to return to work. 
Across the country, survivors of gunshot wounds experience dif-
ficulties ranging from psychological trauma, loss of work, and steep 
medical costs. 
One study estimated that between 2003 and 2013, there was an 
annual average of 30,617 hospital admissions for firearm injuries 
in the United States. For each admission, average costs ranged 
from approximately $19,000 per handgun injury to over $32,000 for 
assault weapon injury. 
Even  after  the  immediate  hospital  costs,  survivors  of  gunshot 
wounds face a lifetime of medical care costs, including readmission 
to the hospital and nursing care. Several studies have shown that 
the lifetime costs of providing care following a gunshot wound are 
more than twice the costs of providing acute care. One study put 
the cumulative lifetime costs of treating gunshot wounds incurred 
in a single year in this country at $2.3 billion. 
I have been living with grief and loss for nearly four years since 
my dad was ripped from our lives, but I have not been standing 
by silently. As a member of the Everytown Survivor Network, I 
share my story to put a human face to our Nation’s gun violence 
crisis. We advocate for change to help ensure that no other family 
faces the type of tragedy that we have experienced. 
We should all be free to live without the fear of being shot. No 
one law can stop all gun violence, but there is so much more we 
must do to keep our families safe. The House of Representatives 
has  already  passed  bipartisan  legislation  to  require  background

checks on all gun sales and is considering a strong red flag law. 
Now the Senate must act on background checks and pass a strong 
red flag bill. 
I am not alone supporting stronger gun safety laws. Ninety-five 
percent of Americans support background checks on all gun sales, 
and 85 percent support red flag laws. And every day, 100 Ameri-
cans are shot and killed, and hundreds more are wounded. This is 
not a right or left issue; this is a life or death issue. 
Thank you for your time.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  ADAM  SKAGGS,  CHIEF  COUNSEL  AND 
POLICY  DIRECTOR,  GIFFORDS  LAW  CENTER  TO  PREVENT 
GUN VIOLENCE, NEW YORK, NY 
Mr. Skaggs. Thank you, Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Maloney, 
and all the other members of the committee for the opportunity to 
testify before you today and for your attention to this critically im-
portant issue. My name is Adam Skaggs. I am chief counsel and 
policy director at Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. 
That is the gun safety organization that is led by former Congress-
woman Gabby Giffords. 
As we have already heard today, gun violence in America has an 
enormous human cost. Approximately 36,000 people in this country 
are  fatally  shot  each  year,  and  another  100,000  are  shot  and 
wounded. In 2017, gun deaths reached their highest level in over 
four decades. And while it is the mass shootings that often get the 
most media attention, day-to-day gun violence in this country that 
often does not make the news claims nearly 100 lives and injures 
almost 300 more every single day. 
But as we discuss today, beyond the devastating toll that gun vi-
olence imposes on American families and communities, it imposes 
extraordinary costs on the American economy. Researchers at the 
nonpartisan Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation estimate 
that gun violence costs the American economy at least $229 billion 
annually. And those calculations were completed in 2012. The in-
creasing levels of gun violence since then mean that today, the 
costs are surely even more. 
That includes direct costs, like emergency transport, medical and 
mental health treatment, as well as law enforcement, court, and 
prison expenses. It also includes indirect costs, like lost wages and 
the reduced quality of life for those who live with permanent inju-
ries and pain. Notably, however, that $229 billion figure does not 
take into account a whole host of other additional costs that are 
harder to measure, costs like lost business opportunities, lowered 
property  values,  neighborhood  flight,  and  the  reductions  in  tax 
bases of communities across this Nation. 
These costs fall on each and every one of us as taxpayers. Eighty- 
seven percent of the direct costs of gun violence are borne by tax-
payers, to the tune of roughly $700 per American per year. Law en-
forcement, many court costs, incarceration, are publicly funded, as

is a large portion of the medical expenses associated with treating 
gunshot victims. 
A  2017  study  on  the  costs  of  hospitalizations  of  gun  injuries 
found that 40 percent of the expenses are covered by Medicare and 
Medicaid, and the average costs per admission for a gunshot victim 
to a hospital, an average cost for Medicaid patients, more than 
$30,000. That is $30,000 just for the initial admission to the hos-
pital. Obviously, if gunshot victims require ongoing, long-term care, 
the costs are much, much higher. 
These numbers are staggering, yet they do not even capture the 
total costs of American gun violence. A 20-year lack of Federal in-
vestment in gun violence research has prevented scholars from an-
swering more complex, more complicated questions about the toll 
that this violence extracts from our economy, like the differences 
in lifetime healthcare costs for different types of gunshot wounds, 
or the ways and manners in which gun violence stifles economic de-
velopment and growth. 
We may not have exact answers to all of these questions, but we 
know two things for sure. First, gun violence is not inevitable. And 
second, there are policy solutions proven to save dollars and to save 
lives. For example, community violence intervention programs have 
been  proven  effective  in  reducing  gun  homicides  and  nonfatal 
shootings that are disproportionately concentrated in underserved 
communities of color in our cities. 
In recent years, violence reduction stages deployed in commu-
nities from Connecticut to Oakland, California, have been proven 
to cut rates of shootings in half. They have reduced shootings by 
50 percent. And studies in Connecticut and in Massachusetts have 
shown that for every dollar invested in these kinds of programs, $7 
are saved. 
Congress should fund these programs. And Congress should fund 
support to States that have adopted extreme risk laws, laws that 
allow courts, upon a showing of serious danger that a person poses 
to themself or to others, allow them to be temporarily disarmed. 
Congress should fund States that are moving forward. Seventeen 
States and the District of Columbia have now moved forward with 
these laws, signed into law by Republican governors, Democratic 
governors, often with broad bipartisan support. 
Congress should also require a background check on every gun 
sale to prevent dangerous people from acquiring guns. That is com-
mon sense. It has backing of 90 percent of the public. And the 
House has already passed it this year. The House has also allotted 
$50 million for research by the CDC and the NIH, and it is cur-
rently debating policies to disarm people convicted of hate crimes 
and to restrict the large-capacity magazines that make mass shoot-
ings so deadly. As I said, these policies would save dollars and they 
would save lives, and the Senate should follow the House’s lead. 
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I look for-
ward to your questions.

sions for the Record on page 47.]

STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN LOTT, JR., PRESIDENT, CRIME 
PREVENTION RESEARCH CENTER, ALEXANDRIA, VA 
Dr. Lott. Thank you very much. I appreciate being invited here, 
Chairman  Lee  and  Vice  Chair  Maloney,  for  the  opportunity  to 
speak. 
Guns make it easier for bad things to happen. But they also 
make it easier for people to protect themselves and prevent bad 
things from happening.  Are  the slides  going to be up? Yes.  All 
right. 
Anyway,  so  we  hear  discussions  about  the  costs  of  guns,  but 
what we need to do, it makes no more sense to only count people 
killed or people injured than it is to say lives that were saved by 
guns or injuries that are prevented. The question is: What is the 
net cost? 
And all the different costs that we hear in terms of hospitaliza-
tion or lost work time or lost business opportunities apply just as 
well to people who are hurt by guns as well as to lives that are 
saved. And again, the question is: What is the net effect? 
And one simple question to go and ask is: We can look around 
the world in places that have banned guns. If our net guns are bad, 
you would think that murder rates would go up. And yet in every 
single place, not just Washington, D.C., and Chicago, which have 
tried gun bans, but every country, even island nations that have 
tried gun bans, murder rates have gone up, usually dramatically, 
after gun bans have been in place. There is not one place that one 
can point to where guns are banned where murder rates stayed the 
same or even fell. Next. 
One way of kind of measuring the costs and benefits of having 
guns is to look at the rate that guns are used in commissions of 
crime versus the rate that guns are used to go and stop crimes. 
And what you find is that surveys indicate that people use guns 
about four to five times more frequently to stop crimes than they 
are used to go and commit them. 
We heard the comment earlier about how many guns we have in 
the United States, and if we only had so many guns, we should be 
the safest country in the world. There is a distinction here between 
having guns and being able to have guns with you. 
So, for example, 94 percent of the mass public shootings that we 
have had in the United States have taken place in those areas 
where we have people banned from being able to go and have guns 
for protection, so-called gun-free zones, where law-abiding citizens 
are not able to go and protect themselves. 
These killers, these mass public shooters who want to go and get 
attention, like Senator Lee was pointing to earlier, want to go to 
places where they can kill as many people as possible. You cannot 
do anything but read the diaries or other statements that these 
killers have left and not come away with the fact that they pur-
posely picked those places where people cannot defend themselves 
precisely because they want to kill more people than you would be 
able to go and kill otherwise. 
If  you  think  gun  control,  extremely  strict  gun  control,  would 
lower crime, one need only look at Mexico. Since 1972, Mexico has 
had only one gun store in the country. It is run by the military. 
Extremely extensive background checks and psychological screen-

ing. Only about 1 percent of Mexicans legally own a gun. And yet 
it looks like, this year, Mexico will again have a murder rate that 
is going to be about six times higher than what we have here in 
the United States. 
One thing that is included in a lot of the numbers that have been 
discussed so far is suicides. In fact, if you take out justifiable homi-
cides, about two-thirds of the deaths, or 70 percent of the deaths, 
involve suicides in any given year. The assumption seems to be if 
we take away guns, you are going to eliminate suicides. In fact, the 
vast majority of academic research by economists and criminolo-
gists shows that, in fact, there are very close substitute ways, and 
you do not see changes in the total numbers of suicides. Next slide. 
So just as an example, in terms of the success rate for commit-
ting suicides, I have data here from a number of different types of 
things—shotguns to the head, cyanide, gunshot to the head, explo-
sive, being hit by a train or a truck, jumping from a height, hang-
ings—all of them have relatively similar success rates in terms of 
committing suicides. Next. 
Now, I could tell you, I think, a pretty quick, few, very reason-
able  changes  that  could  be  made  in  the  universal  background 
checks bills that would get them passed very quickly. One is deal-
ing  with  the  false  positives.  We  frequently  hear  that  there  are 
three and a half million dangerous, prohibited people who have 
been  stopped  from  owning  guns  because  of  background  checks. 
That is simply false. Virtually all of those are mistakes, and it is 
very simple to correct that. 
All you have to do is have the Federal Government, when it does 
criminal  background  checks  or  other  background  checks  on  gun 
buyers, meet the exact same rules that the Federal Government re-
quires that private companies do. If private companies had an error 
rate that the Federal Government has, they would be sued out of 
existence. And it overwhelmingly hits minorities. The costs are also 
extremely great, too. You could fix these things just by having the 
government pay for this out of general revenue. Last—skip two 
slides. One more. 
Here is a survey that has recently been completed of academics— 
economists, criminologists, and public health researchers. And you 
can basically see, with the exception of economists, with regard to 
gun-free zones and eliminating them, all the other groups are pret-
ty relatively skeptical of different types of gun control. 
This is the largest survey that has been done of academics. Even 
the public health people, which are relatively more favorable to-
wards gun control, there is no category where they are really much 
different than the midpoint in terms of, then, for other things, and 
particularly for criminologists and economists. They are much more 
skeptical. 
I greatly appreciate your time, and I look forward to the ques-
tions.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  SUZANNA  HUPP,  FORMER  MEMBER  OF 
THE  TEXAS  HOUSE  OF  REPRESENTATIVES,  LAMPASAS 
COUNTY, TX 
Dr. Hupp. Good afternoon. My name is Suzanna Hupp, and I 
am representing myself. I believe you have been supplied with my 
written testimony, which goes into a lot more detail than I can in 
five minutes. 
You  titled  this  hearing,  ‘‘Gun  Violence  in  America:  Under-
standing and Reducing the Cost of Firearm Injuries and Deaths.’’ 
I am here to just make sure that you also consider the high cost 
of gun control in your discussions. 
In 1991, my parents and I were at a Luby’s Cafeteria in Killeen, 
Texas. We had just finished eating when a madman crashed his 
truck  through  the  floor-to-ceiling  window  and  then  methodically 
began executing people. I reached for the gun in my purse on the 
floor next to me, but then realized that a few months earlier I had 
made  the  stupidest  decision  of  my  life.  My  gun  was  100  yards 
away, dutifully left in my car to obey the law because at that time 
in the State of Texas, carrying a handgun was illegal. We did not 
have any type of concealed carry. 
I cannot begin to get across to you how frustrating it was sitting 
there waiting for it to be your turn like a fish in a barrel with no 
meaningful way of fighting back. When my father saw what he 
thought was a chance, he ran at the guy, but the guy just shot him 
after he covered about half the distance. As I escaped, my mother 
stayed behind with her husband of 47 years, cradling him until the 
gunman got back around to her. 
To shorten the story up for this, 23 people were killed that day, 
including my parents. It was the largest mass shooting in our coun-
try at that time. I want you to understand that the only thing gun 
control did that day was to prevent me from being able to protect 
myself and my family. 
By the way, law enforcement was one building away in a con-
ference, and in an odd twist of gun control fate, the manager of the 
conference hotel had asked them to store their weapons in their ve-
hicles so as not to offend the other hotel patrons. They told me 
later—several of them were patients of mine—that it took precious 
minutes for them to retrieve their guns from the trunks of their 
cars before they could run to the scene. 
Then all they had to do was fire a shot into the ceiling. This guy 
rabbited to the back bathroom alcove area because they are, by na-
ture, chickens; they exchanged some gunfire with him, and he put 
a bullet in his own brain. 
I have got to tell you, can you imagine being in that position 
today, but instead of having your parents with you, what if you 
have your children or your grandchildren with you? Even if you 
have chosen not to have a gun, do you not hope the guy behind you 
has one and knows how to use it? 
I can tell you that the cost of gun control on October 16, 1991, 
was my parents and 21 other innocent lives, several of whom, like 
the cops, had dutifully left their guns in their cars. 
So we have seen so many of these mass shootings since then— 
restaurants, post offices, schools, day cares, dance clubs, theaters— 
but nearly every one of them had a sign depicting a red circle with

a line through a gun. So explain this to me. If guns are the prob-
lem, why have we not seen any of these mass shootings at NRA 
conventions, or skeet and trap competitions, or the dreaded gun 
show, places where there are thousands of guns in the hands of 
law-abiding citizens? 
So I understand—having been a politician, I understand the need 
to do something. So if you want to make a difference, I think you 
should start by speaking truthfully and accurately, without any 
misleading rhetoric. I have found that the average reporter and, 
quite frankly, a lot of your own staffers have no idea what a semi-
automatic is. They think it is essentially a rapid fire machine gun- 
type weapon. Those are automatics, and they have been illegal in 
this country without a special license since the 1930s. So I carry 
a semiautomatic. Every woman I know that carries, carries a semi-
automatic. So yes, you are talking about our guns. 
I think Representative O’Rourke finally said out loud what many 
have obfuscated for years. He essentially said he does want to take 
away the guns that are designed to kill. And let me assure you that 
if someone threatens me or mine, that is exactly what I want it to 
do. 
Universal background checks are not the answer. Existing back-
ground checks have failed miserably, and I am a firm believer that 
this just becomes a de facto registration. And honestly, if you look 
at history, registration always, always, always leads to confisca-
tion. 
So if you want some common-sense legislation, rid us of public 
gun-free zones. Spree killers want to go where they can rack up a 
high body bag count. That again is the cost of gun control. 
The next positive change could be fleshed out through a task 
force implemented at the State level. I will tell you, my husband 
is a criminal psychologist who provided a description of how we 
could prevent many if not all of these shooting sprees, and that is 
in my written testimony. 
In the end, again, the title given to the hearing, in part, is, ‘‘Re-
ducing the Cost of Firearm Injuries and Deaths,’’ and while at-
tempting to reduce violence as a whole is a worthy cause, I find it 
pointless to focus on the tool. A gun can be used to kill a family. 
A gun can be used to protect a family. It is just a tool. And by the 
way, an estimated 350 million guns in America did not hurt any-
body this year, and that is a staggering statistic. 
Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Dr. Hupp appears in the Submissions 
for the Record on page 78.] 
Vice Chair Maloney. I want to thank all the panelists. 
I have a question for you about the prevalence of gun violence 
in the United States. I would like to get your perspective on it. But 
first I would like to show a brief video from Steve Kerr, coach of 
the Golden State Warriors. His father was shot and killed when 
serving as president of American University of Beirut. 
[Video played.] 
Mr. Skaggs, is what he says true? Is the United States in a 
‘‘league of its own?’’

shared with us is absolutely right. As I said at the outset, Ameri-

cans are 25 times more likely to be killed in a gun homicide than 
are residents of other high-income countries. With 100 people being 
shot and killed every day, with 300 more Americans suffering gun-
shot wounds, I find it hard to argue that this is not a crisis. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Ms. Meins, I appreciate very, very much 
your testimony and your courage today. And you have given us an 
insight into the high personal and economic costs associated with 
gun violence. But the cost your family has suffered did not end on 
that day that your father was killed. How has the San Bernardino 
attack affected the way you think about your own plans and your 
own future? 
Ms. Meins. Everything changed for my family after that day. I 
had  a  nice  career  in  procurement  and  purchasing  services,  and 
after that I decided that I needed to be more dedicated to trying 
to stop this so that other families do not have to face these kinds 
of tragedies. I am very sorry for anyone that has suffered from any 
kind of loss due to gun violence. 
But I decided that it was important for me to try to speak on be-
half of my family and put a face to the tragedy so that other sur-
vivors could have a voice so that people truly understood what the 
toll of violence is. So everything changed. Our psychological and 
emotional well-being changed. Our life plans changed. Our finances 
were affected. Everything changed. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Mr. Skaggs, it has been reported that a 
man who carried out the massacre in Odessa and Midland had 
failed a background check because of a previous offense, yet be-
cause of loopholes in current background checks laws, he was able 
to buy an AR-style gun in a private transaction from an unlicensed 
seller who was not required to run a background check. 
Would H.R. 8, the background check legislation passed by the 
House earlier this year, have applied to this gun purchase? Would 
it have made a difference? 
Mr. Skaggs. Absolutely. Absolutely. That is exactly the type of 
scenario that H.R. 8 is designed to prevent. We have heard that 
since its inception, the National Criminal Background Check Sys-
tem has stopped 3.5 million prohibited persons from obtaining guns 
through sales by licensed dealers. 
But in the vast majority of the country, someone who fails a 
background check, is denied a gun purchase, can just simply turn 
around, go online to one of many websites that advertise millions 
of guns for sale without any background checks whatsoever and 
meet someone in the parking lot of a McDonald’s or outside an-
other store and buy that gun for cash with no questions asked, no 
background check whatsoever. 
That just defies common sense, that somebody who fails a back-
ground check because of a criminal record, because they have been 
convicted  of  domestic  abuse  or  otherwise  subject  to  a  domestic 
abuse restraining order, these people should not be allowed to turn 
around after failing background checks and simply buy guns with-
out any security whatsoever. 
So that is exactly what H.R. 8 would address, and that is why 
it is so critically important that after the House’s leadership on this 
issue, that the Senate follow suit.

Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you. 
Dr. Lott. Because the person that sold the gun to the Odessa 
killer actually was committing a crime because he was selling a 
ghost gun, something that he had made himself, and was punish-
able by five years in Federal prison. He did not have a manufactur-
er’s license to go and do that. So it is not clear, if he was already 
committing that crime, which was a five-year felony under Federal 
law, why the additional law would have made any difference in 
that case. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Well, I tell you, we have had hearings in 
the  Government  Reform  and  Oversight  Committee,  on  which  I 
serve, where the law enforcement, Border Patrol along the U.S.- 
Mexico border, testified that the gun laws are so lax on selling ille-
gal guns that they do not even bother to arrest people because it 
is not even a Federal felony now to sell illegal guns. 
And they have asked us to correct that, and we have bills in to 
correct that, to make selling illegal guns a felony. And the others 
have complained, from law enforcement, about these straw pur-
chasers who buy guns and give them to other people, that the pen-
alties are not preventing them from acting. 
Dr. Lott. But it is not—— 
Vice Chair Maloney. But right now, my time is up, and I am 
recognizing my colleague, Representative Schweikert. 
Representative Schweikert. Thank you, Vice Chair Maloney, 
though I think what you just described was a felony. 
This is actually a subject I have had intense interest in. And I 
am going to say one of those things I think will instantly offend 
everyone: I fear we often have absolutely the wrong discussion. 
And let me walk through some of the mechanics. 
We have data sets that show, if I take the last 30 years, which 
is probably the appropriate sample size, why have some commu-
nities in our country gotten dramatically safer, and why have oth-
ers not? We see some interesting data coming out of my home, 
Phoenix, Arizona, where statistically, divided by the 100,000, sub-
stantially safer than 30 years ago. 
What did a community like that do? Was it mental health serv-
ices? Was it community policing? Was it just age demographics? 
And what—concealed carry. There is lots of inputs, and I believe 
we treat each other almost intellectually dishonestly when we say 
it is going to be this shiny object or that shiny object. Complex 
problems require complex understanding. 
What do some communities do that are working, and what are 
other communities do that do not work? And then could we all just 
agree we are going to do less of this and more of this? The most 
precious thing in my world is I have a four-year-old little girl. And 
damn it, I worry about this because something we as elected offi-
cials do not talk enough about is we are the inbound to a lot of 
hate, and we think about this a lot. 
And I am going to break some protocols, and I am going to ask 
us to be very brief. Mr. Skaggs, I should also disclose I have known 
Gabby Giffords for a very long time, and I have considered her one 
of the people I was close to in Arizona. And we have—some of the 
staff around you, we have had this very conversation.

I was fascinated. You pointed out that there are some violence 
intervention  programs.  Could  you  specifically  just  talk  about, 
quickly, what is working on those? 
Mr. Skaggs. Sure, absolutely. And I appreciate your remarks. I 
think you are absolutely right. There is no one simple solution to 
this incredibly complex and serious problem. But let’s just take a 
look at those community violence interruption programs. 
There are multiple different models. There are some that are 
based in hospitals that use the moment of intervention when some-
body is wounded, either in a gunshot or a stabbing, to intervene 
and break the cycle of violence. There are others that engage stake-
holders across the community. 
But  these  require  adequate  funding.  They  require  adequate 
resourcing, and there has not been the kind of Federal support for 
these successful, proven models. And in cities where these have 
had a temporary effect but then have not had sustained success, 
it is because there has not been sustained resourcing. 
Representative  Schweikert.  But  even  a  temporary  effect  is 
statistically significant. 
Dr. Lott, I have read bunches of your material. I appreciate the 
data. Back to my scenario: Why have some communities gotten 
dramatically safer in the last three decades and others have not? 
What has worked? What has not? 
Dr. Lott. Well, I think if you look at the research by economists, 
you will find about 50 percent of the variation of crime rates can 
be explained by law enforcement generally. Places that you have 
more effective policing, being able to increase the arrest rate per 
crime that is committed, is extremely important. 
Other things—just making it costly and riskier for criminals to 
go and commit crime has a very important impact on that. Longer 
prison sentences also played an important role. I do not think polic-
ing solves everything and I do not think guns do, either. I mean, 
concealed carry may only explain about 5 percent or so of the vari-
ation that you see over time. I think it produces a beneficial effect, 
but I think it has to be part of overall policies. 
Representative  Schweikert.  Dr.  Hupp,  now—and  Dr.  Lott, 
you can correct me—now, I have seen some things where there has 
been an attempt to normalize the data. This State chose a mental 
health program. This State chose community policing. This State 
chose a type of concealed carry or constitutional carrier. 
Has anyone done some academic research where I can see pluses 
and minuses? Because we have a data set that says States have 
chosen concealed carrier have actually gotten substantially safer. 
Dr. Hupp. The statistical evidence may be a better question to 
Dr. Lott. But I can tell you that the problem that I have seen, and 
I have testified in a lot of different States, is that we have a lot 
of mental health programs, and certainly I do in my own State, 
where if someone, let’s say in school, is deemed a mental health 
question mark there—there is a question mark—they send some-
one in to do an assessment. But that’s a mental health assessment. 
And I do not want to go too far off the deep end here because 
I am not a mental health expert. But I can tell you that what we 
are recommending is a threat assessment, which is an entirely dif-
ferent thing, and we already have laws in place. We just—it is not

cohesive, and it is not cohesive across the board to where people 
know what to do with them. 
Representative Schweikert. But that may be—and Vice Chair 
Maloney,  thank  you  for  your  tolerance  on  the  tyranny  of  the 
clock—I desperately wish we could have, actually, a more robust, 
intellectually honest—I know often we are blinded by our partisan 
shiny objects. 
But we can see in our communities, there are those who have 
gotten safer. Let’s do more of that. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Let’s do more research there. And our 
Chairman of the committee, Mr. Lee, is recognized for five minutes. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you, Vice Chair Maloney. 
Dr. Hupp, in your testimony you mentioned a surprisingly com-
mon misunderstanding about guns, the difference between semi-
automatic guns and those that are not. Are there any other com-
mon misconceptions that you find as you visit with Americans? 
Dr. Hupp. Yes. I think something that always jumps out to me 
that has frankly been a frustration for me for a very long time is 
that in many of the States that allow carry—and I do not care if 
it is concealed carry or open carry, just that allow carry—why is 
it that you all will trust the teacher across the street at a grocery 
store walking around with families and strollers, and then the mo-
ment she comes across the street into her place of work, the school, 
where we know the schools are targets, why are we saying, sud-
denly, we do not trust her? We do not trust her to protect herself 
or her students. 
I am not saying arm the teachers. I have never said that. But 
those that already have jumped through the hoops to be able to 
arm themselves should be trusted in those places that we know are 
targets. That is a big one for me. 
And again, the ridding ourselves of gun-free zones—again, those 
are targets. And let me clarify that I do not think my gun is a 
guarantee. It is not a guarantee. It just changes the odds in many 
circumstances. I do not think we should be focusing on the tool; I 
have had people say, ‘‘Well, your gun would not have made a dif-
ference in the Las Vegas situation.’’ 
But I think that just lacks a little imagination. The guy had two 
planes a mile away. All he had to do was fly one of them into the 
crowd; he would have killed hundreds if not thousands that way. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you. 
Dr.  Lott,  some  of  your  fellow  witnesses  have  referred  to  poll 
numbers regarding universal background checks. Are you familiar 
with those polls? 
Dr. Lott. Yes. 
Chairman Lee. And what is your opinion on them? 
Dr. Lott. Well, people have mentioned polls showing 90 percent, 
95  percent,  97  percent  support.  These  are  usually  one-sentence 
questions that really do little more than ask people whether they 
want to try to stop criminals from going and obtaining guns. 
If you actually looked at ballot initiatives that have been put on 
the ballot, most recently in 2016 in Maine and Nevada. Michael 
Bloomberg would outspend his political opponents by ratios of 6 to 
1 or 3 to 1, but still lost. There is a reason why he is not putting 
ballot initiatives on for these background checks.

If it really was 90 percent of 80 percent or 70 percent support 
for these things, it would not be necessary for him to outspend the 
other side just to be able to try to get near 50 percent in terms of 
the results there. And I think if they really thought that there was 
this huge support, he would be putting more initiatives on the bal-
lot, and we are not seeing that. 
Chairman Lee. We have heard a lot of talk today about dif-
ferent kinds of research that have been conducted. Is there a type 
of research you would like to see more of when it comes to fire-
arms? 
Dr. Lott. Well, there is a huge amount of research that is done 
anyway. The Federal Government, from 2015 through 2018, spent 
$43 and a half million. You have people like Michael Bloomberg, 
who is literally spending hundreds of millions of dollars on this; 
George Soros; the Joyce Foundation. Others are spending tremen-
dous amounts of money. Rand is spending $20 million, apparently; 
hopefully it gets up to $50 million on this. 
The interesting thing to me is that this vast amount of refresh 
is almost all—the funding is being concentrated on public health. 
There are huge differences, as I showed in the survey that we had. 
Economists and criminologists, who have not been getting this type 
of government funding are much, much more skeptical of any of 
these different types of gun control laws that work. 
The funding for the CDC and the—90 percent of the $43 and a 
half  million  that  the  Federal  Government  spent  went  to  public 
health research. 
Chairman Lee. In the time we have remaining, I was reading 
your written testimony. You have some charts and some analysis 
that discusses the relationship between gun-related homicides and 
gun  ownership  rates  in  different  countries.  Can  you  walk  us 
through those really quickly? 
Dr. Lott. Sure. Well, I mean, we have homicide data for different 
countries as well as firearm homicide. I will just mention one thing 
since we have had a little bit of discussion. 
Only about half the countries in the world even report firearm 
homicide data. We are kind of spoiled with all the data that we 
have here. One of the reasons why the United States looks rel-
atively high in terms of firearm homicides is that the countries 
with the highest homicide rates do not report homicides. 
But if you look at either homicides or firearm homicides, the 
countries with the highest gun ownership tend to have the lowest 
homicide rates. And that is also true for mass public shootings. The 
United States ranks about 65th out of 90 countries that we have 
data for on mass public shootings, and it is just that we do not rec-
ognize that because attacks in the rest of the world, except for 
maybe New Zealand or a couple other ones, usually do not get that 
much attention. But the countries that tend to have the most gun 
ownership tend to have the fewest mass public shootings. 
Chairman Lee. I see my time is expired. Thank you. Thank 
you, Madam Chair. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Okay. 
Mr. Beyer. 
Representative  Beyer.  Thank  you.  Thank  you  all  for  being 
here today to discuss America’s gun violence epidemic.

I want to recognize that September is Suicide Prevention Aware-
ness  Month.  Suicide  is  a  leading  cause  of  death  across  all  age 
groups and suicide deaths have increased 33 percent since 1999. In 
2017 we lost 47,000 people to suicide in the United States, and 
about half of those deaths are gun deaths. In Virginia it is 57 per-
cent of suicides are by guns. I believe in every single State that has 
universal  background  checks,  the  suicide  rates  are  lower  than 
those that do not. 
And data shows there are several useful mechanisms to deter 
people from hurting themselves in moments of crisis, including re-
stricting access to lethal means, which is what the Extreme Risk 
Protection Order Act and red flag bills do. We have three suicide 
prevention bills moving their way through the House right now, 
and I am really looking forward to them. 
By the way, I want to correct just a few things. I was ambas-
sador to Switzerland for four years. They have had registration for 
decades and decades, and no one has confiscated their weapons. I 
believe we can do many other things. 
My dad used to—one of his favorite aphorisms was, ‘‘Lies, damn 
lies, and statistics.’’ I was looking at those charts and they were 
just making me more and more uncomfortable. To my friend Mr. 
Schweikert’s shiny objects, more guns, less crimes. Let’s make it 
really  simple.  We  have  350  million-plus  guns.  Firearms-related 
death rates per 100,000. Fifty-nine states that I wrote down. And 
I am going to use some of my time just to make the point. 
These are the states that have—the countries that have a lower 
firearm death rate per 100,000 people than we do: Argentina, Aus-
tralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, 
Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Fin-
land, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ice-
land,  India,  Ireland,  Israel,  Italy,  Japan,  Kuwait,  Latvia, 
Kyrgyzstan, Luxembourg, Moldova, Montenegro, Netherlands, New 
Zealand,  Nicaragua,  North  Macedonia,  Norway,  Paraguay,  Peru, 
Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, 
South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, 
Turkey, Ukraine, U.K., Uruguay, and Zimbabwe. At least 59 coun-
tries have a lower homicide and suicide rate by firearms than does 
the United States with its 350 million weapons. 
Ms. Meins, thank you for bravely sharing your experience with 
the death of your father. Too many times after the loss of life dur-
ing a mass shooting, we see death by suicide of victims’ family 
members. We saw it a number of times after Florida. Can you talk 
for a minute about this connection and how research might help 
policy-makers address it? 
Ms. Meins. I think I would like to share—I mean, I would like 
to save the harder policy questions for perhaps possibly Adam. But 
I will say that we know of at least one person involved in the San 
Bernardino shootings that was a family member that did commit 
suicide. And I know that there is ongoing trauma that the sur-
vivors, their family members, their friends, their communities face 
as a result of shootings. 
And so I think that further policy research into those—into what 
could help with that is really important. But I think that a red flag 
law, those extreme risk protection orders that you spoke of, would

be highly beneficial in making sure that people that are at risk for 
hurting themselves and others could get some sort of intervention. 
Representative Beyer. Yes. There is a growing body of evi-
dence to the people who go to a gun shop to buy a weapon to kill 
themselves, and are turned away, end up not killing themselves at 
all. They do not go then to look for a bridge or some pills. 
Mr. Skaggs, we lose a person by suicide by gun in Virginia every 
14 hours. We have a bunch of different policy considerations. But 
do you think making guns more readily available would help the 
suicide epidemic in the United States? 
Mr. Skaggs. I do not. I think you are right. There are a number 
of tools—excuse me. I do not think that making more guns avail-
able will reduce suicide in Virginia. I think there are, however, a 
variety of policy tools that legislators in Virginia could enact that 
would be likely to reduce the rate of suicide in Virginia. 
We have already heard about extreme risk laws. Those are the 
law in 17 States now. Two of the States to have adopted them on 
the earlier side, Connecticut and Indiana, leading researchers at 
Duke University have shown that those had a demonstrable reduc-
tion in suicide in those States. 
And  I  think  as  the  other  States  gain  more  experience  imple-
menting these extreme risk laws, we will see suicide rates come 
down there. Waiting period laws that allow for somebody who is in 
a period of immediate crisis to take a breath and have a cooling- 
off period, those also can reduce suicide. 
And finally, I want to flag a policy that has just been pursued 
in Washington State, which allows somebody who is going through 
a personal crisis to put themself on a ‘‘Do not buy’’ list, so to put 
themself on a list that prevents them from purchasing a gun. And 
of course they can go through steps to restore the right to buy a 
gun. 
But this is not something that anybody else is preventing them 
from buying a gun. It is a tool that empowers individuals dealing 
with suicidal ideation to stop themselves from taking a risk that 
is very heavily associated with suicide. 
I do not list all those policies to suggest that any one of them 
would be a panacea and would solve all suicides, or that there is 
any law that would solve all gun deaths at all. But I list them be-
cause the experimentation that is possible is something that we 
should all be pursuing. We should all be trying to find new solu-
tions to these ongoing and persistent problems. 
Representative Beyer. Could I make a quick follow-on com-
ment, please? 
Vice Chair Maloney. The gentleman’s time is expired. 
Representative Beatty. 
Representative  Beatty.  First  of  all  let  me  just  say  to  you,

Demand Action,’’ let me just say thank you. There are not enough 
words I can say to you for what you have gone through and what 
you represent. 
Today for me is listening. There are no words for how we are an-
chored  at  this  table,  Doctor,  for  you  and  what  you  had  to  go 
through, or Ms. Meins, what you had to go through. I do not have 
words, and I cannot imagine my children and grandchildren or par-
ents. But thank you for your testimony. I think today it helps us 
move the needle. Mr. Skaggs, thank you. 
I support much of what you have brought in information and 
data. I was born in Dayton, Ohio. I witnessed sitting in that fu-
neral of one of the nine victims. I was there and went to the fu-
neral of the nine individuals who were shot in that church with 
Congressman Clyburn in Charleston. So for me, from afar it is a 
heavy heart. 
I have read part of the excerpts from your book. I know like me 
you served the State House in Texas, and I served in the Ohio 
State House. So I say today for us, when we look at all the lost 
wages and what that is like, not only to be suffering from the eco-
nomics, which some can survive it and many cannot, that for me, 
the end of it is we have to do something. 
And we have to listen to see, how do we bridge what Republicans 
and what Democrats together are saying? Because this should not 
be a partisan issue. This is about real people and real lives and the 
economy. And I don’t know how we get Madam Chair to the econ-
omy part without struggling through how we save lives. I am not 
for anybody taking away a person’s Second Amendment right. My 
father carried a gun. So I understand that. 
But what I do know is that we have to have some different laws. 
And it will not, Mr. Lott, probably save everyone from every shoot-
ing. But I do not know how we cannot do something for those who 
are irresponsible. And in many of those cases that we have wit-
nessed, there has been some alarming fact that some light bulb 
should have gone off. 
And that does not mean to take away your gun and not let you 
have your bullets. Maybe on that day I am wishing you had it. But 
here is what I do know. I know we have to have some action before 
we get to the economics of the lost wages and the economy that 
speaks to having some common-sense laws. 
Everybody should not, nor do they have the education that you 
have, to carry a gun. We should not be able to have loopholes. If 
it is that important for me or you or anyone to have a gun, then 
you should wait through the period for somebody to do that back-
ground check. If you cannot get on an airplane and fly with me 
every week because you are on a list, you ought not be able to go 
and just buy a gun. I am really talking about some common-sense 
things. 
We have many people. Do we need to put more money into men-
tal health? Yes. But all of this is not the answer. So I am here 
today to listen. But I want real facts. I do not want fraudulent 
data. I do not want people out there pontificating and saying things 
because they get paid to do it or that they are just wanting to have 
their facts out there.

of both sides of the aisle and what helps us. So I am going to be 
around in and out. I am on another committee. But I want to make 
sure that we listen and we hear from you. 
Thank you, and I yield back. 
Vice Chair Maloney. The lady’s time is expired. 
Representative Frankel. 
Representative Frankel. Thank you, Madam Chair. First of 
all, I thank the panelists for being here, all of you. And Ms. Meins 
and Dr. Hupp also, please accept my deepest feelings of sympathy 
for  your  loss.  I  know  you  interpret  what  might  have  been  the 
cause, but I know it was deeply sad for all of you. 
And I also want to thank Moms Demand Action. And I will start 
with a story. A couple weeks ago I went to the home of a woman 
who leads the Moms Demand Action in Del Ray Beach, Florida. 
And I sat with a group of young moms, and had their kids running 
around. And it had just been the first day of school. 
And one of the moms said to  me  that  her five-year-old came 
home  from  school  and  the  mother  said,  ‘‘Well,  how  was  school 
today?’’ And the little girl said, ‘‘Oh, it was very bad.’’ And she said, 
‘‘Why?’’ She said, ‘‘They are making me sit at the seat closest to 
the door.’’ These kids are so stressed out with the Code Reds and 
all. 
And I had a conversation with these young people who work for 
me, the internships this last summer. And they were all teenagers. 
And I asked them, I said to them, ‘‘What is your biggest worry in 
life today?’’ And I was sure they were going to say climate change. 
You know what they told me? They are afraid of being shot at 
school. And I was talking to a very devout Jew the other day, and 
he told me he is afraid to go to temple this year. And my friends 
are telling me they do not even want to go to the movies. Come on. 
Let’s face it. Getting shot is on everyone’s mind right now. 
And I know we have to do a lot of—I just want to say one thing. 
People said, ‘‘Well, this won’t work and that won’t work.’’ I am just 
going to use an analogy. We talk about healthcare, those of us who 
have children. You get your child a measles shot. It may not pre-
vent the chicken pox of tuberculosis, but the fact of the matter is, 
you do not say, ‘‘I am not getting the measles shot because it is not 
preventing every other disease.’’ There are just certain steps that 
we have to take to try to reduce this gun violence. 
Mr. Skaggs, you testified before Dr. Lott and Dr. Hupp testified. 
I would like to ask you to respond to some of their assertions, in-
cluding that banning guns caused more violence, having less semi-
automatic weapons caused more homicides, that gun regulations 
lead to more carnage. There were all kinds of assertions. And I 
would just be interested in your—— 
Dr. Lott. Could I just say what I said? What I said was, you can-
not name one——

Mr. Skaggs. I am happy to answer your question. 
Representative Frankel. I think Mr. Skaggs knows what I am 
getting at with that. I do not want to be—I am not trying to mis-
state. But he heard what you said. 
Mr. Skaggs. Yes. I do not think it is going to be good for any-
body here to tit for tat on everything that everyone has said. But 
there are two points that I really think critically need to be re-
sponded to that have been made by some of the other witnesses. 
The first is that the 3.5 million people prevented from buying 
guns  by  failing  background  checks,  that  those  were  all  false 
positives and that indeed it is a 100 percent failure rate. That is 
just simply false. That is just simply not true. The FBI’s audits 
have found that about 99 percent of those are proper, and the Of-
fice of Inspector General also confirmed that 99 percent of those de-
nials were accurate. So I just need to correct the record on that 
point. 
Dr. Lott. That is not what we said. 
Mr. Skaggs. The other point—please do not interrupt me; excuse 
me—the other point I would like to respond to is the notion that 
States that have flooded more guns into more public places with 
more concealed carry have seen dramatic drops in assaults or in 
crimes or in homicides. 
In fact, the most credible research, what they call the gold stand-
ard of current research methodology—it is called synthetic control 
method—has found that States that relaxed their concealed carry 
laws and moved to a permissive concealed carry regime saw violent 
crime increase by 13 to 15 percent. When looking specifically at 
gun homicide, the sciences at those States that relaxed their stand-
ards for concealed carry have seen firearm homicide rates go up by 
10 percent. 
So I agree entirely. If we want to have an informed discussion 
here,  we  need  to  talk  about  reliable  data,  reliable  facts.  And  I 
would suggest that the best way to get that data is to fund the 
Federal Government, the CDC and the NIH, to conduct the kind 
of research that we need so we can have uniform data that we can 
all look to and we can all come up with solutions based on that 
data. 
Representative Frankel. Thank you. Thank you. 
Vice Chair Maloney. The gentlelady’s time—— 
Dr. Lott. Could I respond to his comments, please? 
Vice Chair Maloney. The gentlelady’s time has expired. 
Dr. Lott. Can I respond to—— 
Vice Chair Maloney. We have rules about how the committee 
is  conducted.  Each  member  has  five  minutes.  We  are  following 
that. 
Dr. Lott. But he directly attacked my work, and it just seems 
like I should be able to respond briefly to it. 
Vice Chair Maloney. You can put it in writing at the end of 
the hearing. I will allow you to respond to it. But we are following 
regular order. Each member has five minutes, and they are entitled 
to their five minutes.

body who owns a lot of firearms and has two kids in school, it has 
been really instructive to just talk with them because they do not 
carry all this baggage the rest of us carry. Some of their absolute 
best memories in life have involved the responsible use of a fire-
arm. And yet they go through these active shooter trainings, and 
it is incredibly hard on them. So I think we could all benefit from 
some of that common sense that they can bring to these discus-
sions. 
Mr. Skaggs, I was hoping you would touch on how the economic 
impacts from gun violence are just not evenly distributed across de-
mographic groups. Can you drill down on that a little bit? 
Mr.  Skaggs.  Well,  absolutely.  And  I  just  think  the  comment 
about your children, our children—we talk about costs of gun vio-
lence today. Our children are going through these Code Red drills. 
There is a trauma that they are experiencing without having any 
school shootings, just going through the preparations and the anx-
iety and the fear that I think may not be quantifiable, but I think 
cannot be forgotten. 
You have got to a very important point because it is absolutely 
correct that gun violence is not evenly distributed. Mr. Schweikert 
earlier today was talking about the fact that some communities 
have made great strides in reducing gun violence. Others remain 
beset upon by unacceptable levels of gun violence. 
And of course there are fundamental socioeconomic forces that 
have driven some of this. And these problems are thorny, and the 
solutions are not simple. But what we do know is when we have 
the data, when we research the program, when we commit the re-
sources, even those hard-hit communities that continue to bear the 
brunt of the gun violence problem, we can bring rates of gun vio-
lence down. 
I talked previously about Oakland, California, which reduced its 
gun shooting rate by 50 percent—the same interventions, the same 
strategies in Connecticut, in the three biggest cities in Connecticut 
with the three worst gun violence problems. The same results in 
aggregate is about a 50 percent reduction in those cities. 
So  we  have  seen  investments.  Some  State  legislatures  have 
begun dedicating targeted funds to these programs. What we need 
is for Congress to step up and dedicate funds to fund these pro-
grams, these lifesaving programs that have been shown time and 
again to bring some of the hardest-hit communities up to levels 
where their gun violence rates are more consistent with some of 
the more fortunate communities in the country. 
Senator Heinrich. Thank you. 
Dr.  Lott,  at  one  point  the  Crime  Prevention  Research  Center 
website printed that your research had been published in Economic 
Journal Watch. Now, that is a peer-reviewed journal. The editor 
came out and said, no, that is not the case. Why the discrepancy? 
How did that happen? 
Dr. Lott. Well, it was originally accepted. And then he decided 
he wanted to make changes in it, and we could not agree on the 
changes. And so then it did not get published. But it was originally 
accepted, and I have email and correspondence to go and show that 
was the case.

Senator Heinrich. Published is a past tense for—would it not 
be wise to wait until something to actually publish the statement? 
Dr. Lott. Well, I think it was listed as ‘‘forthcoming.’’ 
Senator Heinrich. Okay. Dr. Lott, who was Mary Rosh? 
Dr. Lott. Well, it was basically the family email account that we 
had, basically based on the names of my four sons at that time. It 
was an account that the family used. 
Senator Heinrich. Madam Chair, I would ask unanimous con-
sent to enter an article into the record from the Washington Post 
called, ‘‘Scholar Invents Fan to Answer his Critic.’’ 
[The Washington Post article referred to appears in the Submis-
sions for the Record on page 82.] 
Senator Heinrich. And I will just read one quick quote from 
this  article.  Now,  this  is  under  the  name  Mary  Rosh,  but  it  is 
speaking  to  various  online  publications,  and  was,  I  believe,  au-
thored by Dr. Lott. 
‘‘I had him for a Ph.D.-level empirical methods class when he 
taught at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania 
back in the early 1990s, well before he gained national attention, 
and I have to say he was the best professor I ever had.’’ 
Does it show good judgment for a researcher to comment that 
way with regard to your own research under a name that is clearly 
not transparent—— 
Dr. Lott. Well, first of all, I did not write that. 
Senator Heinrich [continuing]. And fraudulent? But—— 
Dr. Lott. First of all, I did not write that. It was a family ac-
count. And there was somebody else in my family who was re-
sponding to attacks that were on me. Okay? So I do not police ev-
erybody in my family when they go and do things like that. And 
I had members of my family who wrote a couple reviews on my 
books and other things like that. I am not going to go and tell—— 
Senator Heinrich. You are quoted in this article as saying, ‘‘I 
probably should not have done it.’’ 
Vice Chair Maloney. The gentleman’s time has expired. 
Dr. Lott. Well, there are two different issues here. Did I use that 
account myself sometimes? And I did, mainly because when I had 
originally participated in these internet chat rooms—— 
Vice Chair Maloney. The gentleman’s time has expired. 
Dr. Lott. Can I please respond to this? 
Vice  Chair  Maloney.  We  are  following  regular  order.  The 
Chairman—excuse me. 
Dr. Lott. Look. When I have been attacked on other committees, 
I have been allowed to respond. 
Vice Chair Maloney. The Chairman—the Chairman and I have 
agreed that at the end of the hearing, we will each have five min-
utes to allocate. He will allocate five minutes for you to respond to 
various attacks or various things that you want to say. 
Dr. Lott. Just two sentences. 
Vice Chair Maloney. At the end of the hearing. 
Dr. Lott. All right. 
Vice Chair Maloney. I am following—people have schedules. 
Dr. Lott. All right. Thank you. 
Vice Chair Maloney. They have other places they have to go.

Vice Chair Maloney. Representative Trone, you are recognized 
for five minutes. And then I will recognize Chairman Lee and he 
can give his five minutes to you. 
Representative Trone. Thank you, Chairman. 
First of all, I want to thank the witnesses here today, especially 
Dr. Hupp and Ms. Meins for the tragedy and difficulty you have 
been subjected to. It is just heart-wrenching to see what has hap-
pened. It is unbelievable. 
I also want to thank the Moms Demand Action, and for willing-
ness to stand up and just be relentless and be focused and just 
never quit. And you saw the same thing from the Parkland stu-
dents were here a few months ago. I met with them. And when you 
think about it, the adults in the room, we failed. We failed and 
failed and failed and failed. And it is just the failure has never, 
never ended. It is continuing. 
And I am not a politician. I come out of a business background. 
This is my first term here. And it is just absolutely mind-boggling 
that something that 90 percent of the American people—so many 
things  we  all  agree  on,  and  I  am  not  against  having  a  Second 
Amendment. I grew up on a farm, and I hunted the pheasants and 
rabbits all my life. I taught my son how to hunt pheasants. And 
we understand about gun safety and being thoughtful and under-
standing that. 
But  the  carnage  that  we  have  allowed  to  happen  throughout 
America—and now it is raining on our children, our most impor-
tant asset—is just unconsolably disappointing that we cannot come 
together  in  a  bipartisan  fashion  and  get  a  couple  damn  things 
done. 
I think the one that really bothers me the most is the suicides. 
I mean, 33,000 people die, roughly, of suicide by gun. I read a stat 
the other day, and it said that when they were able to stop that 
person from making that final fatal decision, and intervene, and go 
back and subject that person to their friends, their family, their 
therapists, et cetera, 90-plus percent of those never, ever attempted 
that again. 
But the fact that that gun was there and available at that mo-
ment, in a moment of supreme despair and anxiety—and yes, we 
are facing a mental health crisis here, we absolutely agree—but if 
that weapon was not there, those folks, the vast majority, would 
still be here with us. A lot of those, of course, are children. 
So we have passed two bills this year. Everybody up on this side 
I know has been sponsors, H.R. 8 and the Charleston loophole. And 
we have got to figure out a way to get this before the Senate. And 
it is just supremely, though, disappointing. 
Let’s talk a second about the money in that, we passed $50 mil-
lion for research. Mr. Skaggs, to look at firearm morbidity, mor-
tality prevention, if the Senate did that, what kind of prevention 
impacts do you see this investment in research would do? And how 
can this Federally funded money inform us as policy-makers to stop 
failing? 
Mr. Skaggs. Well, I think it is—in a couple of ways. First of all, 
it is going to allow for comprehensive data to be collected. The CDC 
has something called National Violent Death Reporting System. It

has only been funded so it could collect data on a small percentage 
of the States. 
When we have mechanisms in place to get comprehensive data 
that can allow folks in your position to craft a successful and well- 
tailored policy solution, we should have uniform data across the 
whole country. So first of all, it is collecting the data. 
Secondly, it is analyzing the patterns of gun violence. It is ana-
lyzing  the  patterns  of  gun  trafficking.  How  do  guns  move  from 
States with very lax laws that allow them to be bought by straw 
purchasers  and  trafficked  to  States  with  stricter  laws,  stronger 
laws? We need to understand gun trafficking better. 
So there are a whole host of questions that researchers at NIH 
and CDC can undertake that can give the tools that policy-makers 
need to craft evidence-based solutions. This crisis is such that we 
should be trying more than one solution. We should not stop with 
just one policy and hope that it will solve everything because it will 
not. 
But what we need to do is experiment based on informed anal-
ysis of what works, what does not, and what the nature of the 
problem  really  is.  And  that  is  going  to  allow  us  to  make  more 
progress. 
Representative Trone. It has got to get off the dime and do 
something. And if some things do not work, so be it. We move on. 
We fail fast and we go. But I am totally with you, and thank you 
for your testimony. 
Mr. Skaggs. Thank you. 
Vice Chair Maloney. The gentleman’s time is expired. 
The Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Lee, is recognized for five 
minutes. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you, Madam Vice Chair. 
Dr. Lott, I would like to invite you to respond to some of the 
points made particularly with regard to the false positives on back-
ground checks and anything else mentioned during that exchange. 
Dr. Lott. Sure. Well, there is a series of things. So I would just 
say if you look around the world, not just in the United States and 
places like Chicago and Washington, D.C., that have banned guns, 
every single time, murder rates have gone up, and they have gone 
up by a lot. You would think out of randomness one time, when ei-
ther all guns have been banned or all handguns have been banned, 
you would see the murder rates fall or even stay the same. But 
every time, it has gone up. 
With regard to the background checks, what was being referred 
to was a small sample of about 400 cases out of the 76,000 that 
were  sampled.  And  of  that  400  non-random  sample—you  would 
think if you are going to test something, at least you are going to 
have a random sample. But they did not even use a random sam-
ple, and it was after a couple stages of review that had already re-
moved a lot of the false positives there. So the report that was put 
out by the Obama administration I think was pretty much useless 
on that. 
If you go through and look at the last annual report that was put 
out on NICS in 2010, there were 76,000 initial denials. The first 
stage of review, which is done by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
and  Firearms,  the  national  office,  no  discretion.  Basically  just

checking to make sure paperwork and everything is okay. No law-
yers looking at it. Ninety-four percent of the cases were dropped at 
that stage. 
When Congress in 2004 did a 10-year review of the Brady Act, 
they did an audit of the second stage of review, which is done by 
the BATF field offices. At that point, another two percentage points 
of the cases—again, no discretion. So just the first two stages of re-
view, you have 96 percent of the cases there with no discretion. 
You can talk to people who actually run these things. Reagan 
Dunn, who is the first director of Project Safe Neighborhoods, he 
was in charge of enforcing these things. He tells you, and he has 
been quoted in the New York Times and other places, saying that 
they would have loved to go after these cases. The reason why in 
2010 you have 76,000 denials and only 28 prosecutions and 13 con-
victions is because the others are not real cases. 
Unfortunately, it is primarily minorities that are overwhelmingly 
hurt. When you look at things like roughly phonetically similar 
names and similar birthdays, people tend to have names similar to 
others  in  their  racial  groups.  Hispanics  have  names  similar  to 
other Hispanics. Blacks have names similar to other blacks. 
Thirty percent of black males in the United States are legally 
prohibited from owning guns because of past criminal history. It 
discriminates  overwhelmingly  against  minorities.  They  are  the 
ones who are hurt by these mistakes. 
And with regard to the concealed carry statistics, I will just men-
tion, there are dozens of studies. One is pointed to in this case. But 
there are other studies that have used synthetic controls, the same 
data,  the  same  types  of  specifications,  and  showing  that  tiny 
changes,  they  actually  get  the  opposite  results  of  what  was 
claimed. And those were published in peer-reviewed journals even 
before the one that was referenced earlier. 
Chairman Lee. In constructing the non-random sample selec-
tion mechanism, why would one do that? When you are trying to 
research data, isn’t the random sample selection mechanism—— 
Dr. Lott. It is sort of—you have to do it. 
Chairman Lee [continuing]. The meat and potatoes of that? 
Dr. Lott. You have to do random. 
Chairman Lee. Why would one choose not to do that? 
Dr. Lott. I don’t know. And I have asked the FBI multiple times. 
I have contacted people there, and they will not provide an answer 
for why they picked a non-random sample. 
Chairman Lee. In the minute I have got left, I would like to 
hear, either Dr. Lott or Dr. Hupp, it was mentioned earlier what 
States might be able to do. I think it is important for States to be 
able to act. States are, in fact, designed to be the laboratories of 
republican democracy within our system. Is there anything in your 
State, your respective States, that you wish you would see passed 
into law? 
Dr. Lott. Well, I will just mention one thing that has come up 
a couple times, and that is school shootings. At the Crime Preven-
tion Resource Center, we just finished a report recently where we 
looked at all school shootings from accidents through 2018. And 
there is not one attack, one shooting of any type where anybody

has been injured or killed, in any of the schools that allow teachers 
to carry. 
You have 20 States that, to varying degrees, including Utah and 
Hassan’s New Hampshire, where basically any teacher who has a 
concealed carry permit is able to go and carry. You have other 
States, Texas, you have over a third of the school districts by last 
fall allowed people to carry. Not one attack at any of these places 
where anybody, one person, has been injured by a shot or killed. 
And it should tell you something there. The types of fears that 
people have about people—students getting hold of guns or a teach-
er accidentally shooting somebody, or they’re shooting a bystander, 
people shooting bystanders at mass public shootings, simply do not 
occur. 
It is easy for people in these debates to talk about things that 
might possibly happen. But in this case, with 20 States actually ex-
perimenting with this, and Utah has had it for 20 years, we do not 
need to go and guess about what the experience is in these places. 
Vice Chair Maloney. The gentleman’s time has expired. 
I recognize myself for five minutes, and first would like to thank 
the Chairman and all of my colleagues for being here and working 
on this issue; and the panelists, all of you for participating, particu-
larly Shenee´ Johnson and Ms. Meins and Dr. Hupp, who shared 
very personal, painful stories with us, and their actions to work for 
a safer America. 
I want to thank the moms for being here today, and really being 
at meetings all around the country, speaking out for bipartisan so-
lutions and for ending this. 
I would like to ask unanimous consent—I will grant it to my-
self—to put in the record a chart prepared by the Joint Economic 
Committee which tells you everything you need to know about gun 
violence in our country compared to other countries. And again the 
red line in this chart is America. 
And next to it is Canada, and people are eight times less likely 
to be killed by a gun if you live in Canada or France. Japan has 
zero deaths from guns, absolute zero. Iceland, zero. And the United 
Kingdom, we are 40 times more likely to be killed by a gun in the 
United States than in the United Kingdom. 
The stats speak for themselves. And when you see numbers like 
that, we stand alone. We stand alone in mass murders. We stand 
alone in the number of deaths. 
[The chart titled ‘‘Rates of Violent Death by Firearm’’ appears in 
the Submissions for the Record on page 41.] 
I  would  like  to  address  my  question  to  Mr.  Skaggs  and  Ms. 
Meins. If you have good data, you have good policy, and both of you 
have indicated our data is not good. For years we were prevented 
from studying gun violence. What can we do—what are the steps 
we have to take—steps that are very clear from the data? 
One of the problems is that you are hearing different data men-
tioned, and we need to have a uniform standard. Could you address 
that? And I just want to say that this issue should be bipartisan. 
We should all be working together to have some solutions to make 
this country safer.

Mr. Skaggs. Well, first, look. I think we have heard a lot about 
peer-reviewed journals and so forth. I think we need to look at the 
highest quality research that we can, and I think we need to look 
to peer-reviewed journals. We need to look to studies that meet the 
highest levels of credibility. That is the first thing. 
I think we are at a moment where we have seen the action in 
the House. We have seen progress. We have seen political progress 
that we have not seen in years. And I think this is a moment 
where the country is crying out and demanding that folks here in 
Congress do something. 
We have got policies with 80 percent, 90 percent of public sup-
port. They have either made it through the House already or they 
are on the way to the House floor. We need to bring that pressure 
on the Senate. I think I will stop there. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Ms. Meins. 
Ms. Meins. I would echo everything that Mr. Skaggs just said. 
And I would also say that in January of 2016, my family wrote an 
article advocating for providing more funding to the CDC to do re-
search. 
And I think that is critical, as well as, again like Mr. Skaggs 
said, really relying on peer-reviewed journals that have a lot of aca-
demic integrity, trying to come up with the best solutions. It is 
going to be a comprehensive set of laws that we need to put in 
place in order to really hit home and be where we want to be on 
this issue. But I think it is really important to make those first 
steps. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Okay. Without objection, I would love to 
put your family’s article into the record. 
[The  January  2016  Meins  family  article  titled  ‘‘Honoring  San 
Bernardino victims means tackling gun violence’’ appears in the 
Submissions for the Record on page 45.] 
Again I thank everyone who participated in this hearing. The 
meeting is adjourned. Thank you.

PREPAREDSTATEMENTOFHON. CAROLYNB. MALONEY, VICECHAIR, JOINT 
ECONOMICCOMMITTEE 
Thank you all for being here today. 
And I’d especially like to thank our witnesses, some of whom have lost family 
members to gun violence. And as we talk about the costs of gun violence, let us 
never forget that the biggest, most tragic cost is the loss of human life. 
I believe that Congress must act to help stem the gun violence epidemic in our 
country. 
In 2017 alone, almost 40,000 people were killed by guns in this country. Firearms 
are now the leading cause of death in young adults. Our gun homicide rate for teens 
and young adults is nearly 50 times higher than other high-income countries. And 
90 percent of all the women killed by firearms in high-income countries are killed 
in the United States. 
In August alone, more than 50 lives were taken in a series of horrible massacres. 
So far this year, there have been 301 mass shootings—that’s more than one per day. 
And yet—unbelievably—some people say that the real problem here is that we 
don’t have enough guns. 
They say that the only thing that will make America safer is more guns. But the 
fact is that if more guns made us safer we already would be the safest country in 
the world. 
In the United States, there are more guns in civilian hands than any other coun-
try in the world. An American is nearly seven times more likely than someone in 
Canada to die by a gun, eight times more likely than someone in France, almost 
20 times more likely than a person in Germany and almost 40 times more likely 
than someone in the UK, Australia or New Zealand, and nearly 200 times more 
than someone in Japan. 
More people in the United States died from firearm-related injuries from 2003 to 
2012 than the entire number of combat fatalities in World War II. 
There is no way to estimate ‘‘cost of a human’’ life. The loss is incalculable. 
But there is also economic cost—a lost breadwinner’s income, astronomical med-
ical costs, costs to employers, schools, police, hospitals and the criminal justice sys-
tem. 
In order to help people better understand those costs, I’ve asked my staff to 
produce a report that compiles data on the economic costs of gun violence in all 50 
States. 
The report finds that: 
• Rural States have the highest costs of gun violence measured as a share of their 
economies. 
• States with high rates of gun ownership have the highest rates of gun suicide. 
• The three largest States suffer the largest absolute costs. 
• High youth death rates from gun violence extend across region. 
In contrast, my State of New York, which has stricter gun laws, including an as-
sault weapons ban, has one of the three lowest costs of gun violence as a share of 
its economy, along with Hawaii and Massachusetts. 
There are three people in this room today—who have suffered heart-wrenching 
losses as a result of gun violence. 
One of our witnesses, Tina Meins, lost her father in the mass shooting in San 
Bernardino, California, in 2015. Dr. Suzanna Hupp, who also is testifying, lost both 
her parents in a mass shooting at a restaurant in Texas in 1991. And Shenee´ John-
son, seated in the first row, lost both a fiance´e and her son to gun violence. 
We must fight to lower the risk that other families are forced to bear such suf-
fering. 
Other countries have drastically reduced gun violence—because they found the 
courage to act. 
In Australia, in 1996, after a man with an assault rifle killed 35 people—the par-
liament responded by banning automatic and semiautomatic weapons and created 
a buyback program that resulted in 650,000 weapons being turned in. That’s polit-
ical courage. 
In  New  Zealand,  in  2019,  after  51  people  were  killed  at  the  Christchurch 
mosque—the parliament acted, voting nearly unanimously to outlaw automatic and 
semiautomatic weapons. That’s guts ... the kind that the U.S. Congress has lacked 
for many years. 
In fact, in 1996, Congress made things worse. 
It passed legislation that effectively blocked all Federal funding for gun violence 
research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

That is why we have gone more than 20 years without substantially deepening 
our knowledge about gun violence prevention and about what we can do to end this 
epidemic. 
This year the Democratic House acted to address this crisis. 
We passed the first gun safety reforms in 25 years. 
The bill requires universal background checks, closes the gun show loophole, and 
gives the FBI more time to conduct life-saving background checks. 
This summer, the House passed another bill, one that I have spent years fighting 
for, to invest $50 million to conduct research on how to reduce gun violence. 
And last week, the House Judiciary Committee sent to the full House a ban on 
high-capacity magazines, ‘‘red flag’’ legislation, and a bill to prohibit those who com-
mit misdemeanor hate crimes from obtaining a gun. 
These are common sense measures that the vast majority of Americans strongly 
support. 
It’s time for change. 
I look forward to a day when our children don’t have to be afraid to go to school. 
When our teachers don’t learn how to treat gunshot wounds. When nearly half of 
Americans aren’t worried about being a victim in a mass shooting. And when those 
who hold the reins of power move beyond hollow offers of ‘‘thoughts and prayers.’’ 
Let us honor the victims of gun violence and their families by working to prevent 
more victims. Let us—like other countries in the developed world—turn tragedy into 
bold action. 
And may all Members of Congress, especially those in the Senate, find the cour-
age to act. 
I look forward to our witnesses’ testimony this afternoon. 
PREPAREDSTATEMENTOFHON. MIKELEE, CHAIRMAN, JOINTECONOMICCOMMITTEE 
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for this hearing of the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee. 
Over the past several weeks, Americans have watched in horror, again and again, 
as our fellow human beings—young and old—have been murdered in high-profile 
mass shootings on our soil. As lawmakers, it is not enough for us to grieve these 
losses. 
It is our responsibility, first, to understand what is causing these horrific events, 
as well as the many other tragic deaths by gun violence that take place in our coun-
try every year. And then, it is our responsibility to find any policies that may help 
prevent tragedies like these in the future—so long as these policies are faithful to 
our Constitution, and do not inadvertently harm the very citizens we are trying to 
protect. 
Mass shootings attract our attention because they have such power to inspire 
fear. When innocent people are gunned down at random and in public, we wonder 
whether we could be next. And our media, obsessed with their click count and 
viewership, too often choose to fan these fears rather than portray the truth about 
the terrible problem of gun violence in this country. Studies have suggested that 
this irresponsible media coverage may actually increase the number of mass shoot-
ings by encouraging potential killers in their sick desire for attention. 
The reality of gun violence in America is less sensational than what we see in 
the media, but no less horrible. Six in ten gun deaths are suicides. In 2017, for 
every victim of a mass shooting, there were 88 victims of gun suicide and another 
52 victims of other forms of gun homicide. Mental illness, spiritual emptiness, and 
a breakdown in family and community life are the underlying causes of much of our 
gun violence epidemic—including even mass shootings. 
Mass shooters seek to inflict on others the pain, fear, and inner torment that they 
are already suffering themselves. They often come from broken homes and dis-
tressed neighborhoods. The JEC’s Social Capital Project has ranked American coun-
ties by the health of their family and community life, and has found that half of 
identified mass shooters come from the bottom quarter of counties. The evil com-
mitted by these murderers must be stopped, but we must also seek to uproot its 
causes. 
Millions of law-abiding citizens use guns to protect themselves, their families, and 
their communities, just as our founders intended. The Constitution protects our 
right to bear arms because if that right were abridged, we would become more de-
pendent for security on our police and our military. And it is no criticism of our po-
lice and military to say that this would ultimately leave us less secure, not more. 
Some Americans have suffered tragedy precisely when they were prevented from ex-
ercising their right to bear arms, as we will soon hear from the personal story of

Dr. Suzanna Hupp. And when we do enact gun-control laws, we know that criminals 
are all too happy to ignore them. One study found that 79% of guns recovered from 
crime scenes were possessed unlawfully. 
This does not mean that we have no ways to keep guns out of the hands of crimi-
nals and, especially, the mentally ill. Our State governments have proposed several 
worthwhile innovations, including those that make it easier for local law enforce-
ment to act swiftly on reports of the suspicious activities that can precede a mass 
shooting. There is room for reform in our Federal statutes as well: for example, we 
could improve local agencies’ reporting to our National Instant Criminal Background 
Check System for firearms purchases. 
Many Americans, including some of our witnesses, have borne in their own lives 
the unspeakable costs of gun violence. It is important for Congress to listen to their 
voices. I hope that this committee can present to the rest of our country a model 
for respectful conversation about some very difficult topics, so that we can work to-
gether to reduce the number of lives lost to gun violence.

RESPONSEFROMMR. SKAGGSTOQUESTIONSFORTHERECORDSUBMITTEDBY 
SENATORKLOBUCHAR 
1) I am concerned about a dangerous loophole in our background check 
system that allows domestic abusers to buy a gun simply because they are 
not married to, or do not have children with, their victims. When a gun is 
present in situations of domestic abuse, a woman is five times more likely 
to  be  killed,  and  according  to  the  Justice  Department,  nearly  half  of 
women killed by romantic partners are killed by dating partners. That is 
why I introduced the Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims 
Act, to close this so-called ‘‘boyfriend loophole’’ and to prevent convicted 
stalkers from buying or owning a gun. 
• How have State laws that prevent domestic abusers and convicted 
stalkers from buying or owning guns been effective in reducing gun vi-
olence? 
Guns and domestic violence are a deadly mix. The gun homicide rate for women 
in the United States is 21 times higher than it is in other high-income countries,1 
a disparity that is fueled in large part by elevated rates of intimate partner homi-
cide in America. 
Despite these risks, Federal law does not prohibit gun possession by people con-
victed of non-felony stalking crimes, and Federal law does not prohibit gun posses-
sion by abusers convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence if they are not married 
to, and do not have children with, their victims. But States across the country have 
taken steps to address the boyfriend and stalker loopholes in Federal law: about 
half the States have laws that prohibit dating partners subject to protective orders 
or convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors from possessing firearms, and nine 
States have similar laws for those convicted of stalking. 
A robust body of research shows that these laws are associated with significant 
reductions in intimate partner homicides. For example, State laws that restrict fire-
arm access in domestic violence cases when a restraining order has been issued are 
linked to a 13% reduction in intimate partner homicides committed with firearms.2 
Ensuring that abusers are actually relinquishing their firearms is also critical: re-
ductions in intimate partner homicides are even larger when State laws require that 
abusers provide proof that they have turned over their guns.3 
The Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act would close critical 
loopholes in our Federal gun laws. These provisions were also included in the Vio-
lence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 that passed the House. The Sen-
ate should similarly move to close these dangerous loopholes in Federal law. 
2) Your research has found that the levels of gun violence, and the associ-
ated costs, are lower in the 19 States that have adopted universal back-
ground checks. 
• What are the economic benefits that you would expect to see if legisla-
tion to require universal background checks became law? 
Universal background checks are a foundational policy for reducing gun violence 
and the associated economic costs to our country. So long as prohibited persons are 
able to bypass the NICS background check system and get their hands on firearms 
through unlicensed sales with no questions asked, we will continue to see unaccept-
able levels of gun violence in our communities. 
There is no single policy that will end gun violence in America, but universal 
background checks represent the single most important step Congress could cur-
rently take to address this epidemic. Reducing the number of Americans being shot 
will lead to significant economic benefits. It will mean lower costs for medical care 
and mental health treatments. It will mean fewer survivors living with reduced 
wages and quality of life. And it will mean less costs associated with law enforce-

Testimony of Adam Skaggs 
Chief Counsel & Policy Director 
Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence 
 
Before the Joint Economic Committee hearing on 
  
Gun Violence in America:  
Understanding and Reducing the Costs of Firearm Injuries and Deaths 
 
Wednesday, September 18, 2019 
 
Thank you Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Maloney, and members of the Committee for the 
opportunity to testify here today, and for your attention to this critically important topic.   
 
My name is Adam Skaggs, and I am Chief Counsel and Policy Director at Giffords Law Center 
to Prevent Gun Violence, the legal arm of the gun safety organization led by former 
​
Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. 
 
Gun violence has an enormous human cost: approximately 36,0001 people in this country are 
shot and killed each year, while an additional 100,0002 are shot and wounded. In 2017, gun 
deaths reached their highest level in at least 40 years. Some of these shootings make national 
headlines and shock the nation, like the recent mass shootings in El Paso, Dayton, Odessa, and 
Midland. But the daily drumbeat of American gun violence receives far less media interest, 
despite the fact that gunfire claims nearly 100 lives,3 and injures almost 300 more, every single 
day.4 This is a uniquely American problem: our gun homicide rate is 25 times that of other 
high-income countries.5

High-Income Countries, 2015,” Preventive Medicine 123, (2019): 20–26.  
Beyond the devastating toll it imposes on American families and communities, gun violence 
imposes extraordinary costs on the American economy. Because of restrictions on meaningful 
data collection, the level of these costs is difficult to measure with precision. But according to 
research conducted by the non-partisan Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation in 2012, 
gun violence cost the American economy at least $229 billion annually.6 Given increased gun 
violence in the intervening years, the current totals are surely even higher. 
 
This totals includes direct costs like emergency transport, medical and mental health treatment, 
as well as law enforcement, court and prison expenses. They also entail indirect costs like lost 
wages, and the reduced quality of life for those who live with permanent injuries and pain.   
 
Notably, the $229 billion estimate does not take into consideration a range of other significant 
​ ​
indirect costs -- like lost business opportunities, lowered property values, neighborhood flight, 
reductions in the tax base of communities across the nation, and the trauma experienced by 
communities that fear mass shootings and live with chronic gun violence. Even if difficult to 
measure, the total costs of gun violence in America plain total hundreds of billions of dollars 
every year. 
 
These costs fall on every one of us: 87% of the direct costs of gun violence are borne by 
taxpayers, to the tune of roughly $700 per person per year.7 Law enforcement, incarceration, 
and many court costs are publicly funded, as is a substantial portion of the medical expenses 
associated with treating victims. A 2017 study on the financial burden of initial hospitalizations 
​ ​
for firearm injuries, published in the American Journal of Public Health, found that 40% of the 
costs are covered by Medicaid and Medicare,8 and the average cost per gun-injury hospital 
admissions for patients on Medicaid is more than $30,000.9 And that is just the initial hospital 
admission; obviously, if ongoing long-term care is considered, the costs are much higher. 
 
These numbers are staggering, but they fail to encompass the total costs of gun violence. A 
20-year absence of federal investment in gun violence research has prevented scholars from 
answering more complex questions about the toll this violence extracts from our economy. What 
are the lifetime healthcare costs for gunshot wounds? What are the effects of trauma associated 
with gun violence on individuals and on the economy? How does gun violence stifle economic 
development and growth? Our nation’s gun violence crisis has reached epidemic proportions,

and policymakers would be better equipped to address this dire threat to public health and 
safety if we had clearer answers to these questions. 
 
What we do know is that gun violence is not inevitable, and policy solutions exist that can save 
both dollars and lives. Community violence intervention (CVI) initiatives have proven effective in 
reducing gun homicides and nonfatal shootings that are disproportionately concentrated in 
urban areas, particularly in underserved communities of color. In recent years, effective violence 
reduction strategies have been implemented in a number of cities, including Oakland, California, 
which has seen a 50% reduction in shootings since 2012. In Connecticut, a state-funded 
​ ​
violence intervention program has helped combined gun violence rates drop more than 50% in 
three major cities since 2011 -- at a cost of less than $1 million per year.  Research has shown 
that this modest investment generates an annual savings of $7 million from averted shootings.  
 
Simply put, the potential return on a nationwide investment in stopping gun violence would be 
huge in both lives and taxpayer dollars. One Harvard criminologist estimates that an eight-year 
​ ​
federal grant program to fund community violence intervention programs would save more than 
12,000 lives with an associated cost savings of $120 billion. 
 
Other smart public policy would further reduce costs. Easy access to guns fuels this epidemic, 
and criminals and dangerous people routinely exploit loopholes in the law to arm themselves. 
Requiring a background check on every gun sale to prevent criminals, domestic abusers, and 
other dangerous people from acquiring guns is common sense, and has the backing of 90% of 
the public. Thankfully, the House passed such a policy earlier this year, and the Senate should 
follow suit. Just last week, the CEOs of 145 companies, including Uber, Twitter, and Bain 
Capital, sent a letter to members of the Senate calling for such action. 
 
The House has also allotted $50 million for research by our premier public health institutes, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes for Health (NIH). 
Again, the Senate must do the same. And in the coming weeks, the House will vote on bills to 
support extreme risk protection orders, to restrict the large capacity magazines that make mass 
shootings so deadly, and to prohibit those convicted of hate crimes from getting their hands on 
guns. These policies have broad public support, and they will save dollars and lives. 
 
Data compiled by Giffords Law Center has made clear for years that states with stronger gun 
laws have lower rates of gun deaths and spend less on gun violence than states with weaker 
laws. But our federal laws remain porous and ineffective and gun violence continues to be a 
tremendous public health and safety crisis that costs hundreds of billions of dollars each year.  
 
This crisis is neither inevitable nor acceptable. Congress should act immediately to stop it. 
 
Mr. Chairman, Madam Vice Chair, members of the Committee, thank you again for the 
opportunity to testify here today. I look forward to your questions. "

Testimony of Tina Meins 
 
On “Gun Violence in America:  
Understanding and Reducing the Costs of Firearm Injuries and Deaths” 
 
 
United States Joint Economic Committee 
 
September 18, 2019 
 
Good morning Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Maloney, and members of the Joint Economic 
Committee. It is an honor to appear before you to testify on the important topic of gun violence 
in America.  
 
My name is Tina Meins and I live in Washington, DC but I grew up in California. Today, I am 
here as a daughter, a sister, a fiancée and a proud recent graduate from the McCourt School of 
Public Policy at Georgetown University.  
 
Today, I represent the 58% of Americans who have said they or someone they care for have 
experienced gun violence in their lifetime.  
 
I am here in honor of my father, Damian, who was shot and killed. He was my travel buddy and 
my best friend. Today, I am my father’s voice.  
 
My dad, mom, sister and I were all extremely close. He was intelligent, hard-working, had a 
great sense of humor and loved to make people laugh. He lived his life in service to others. It 
didn’t matter if he was mowing a neighbor’s lawn, helping a friend move or taking care of a sick 
family member—he was always generous with his time.  
 
He loved his family deeply. Our lives have not been the same since he was taken.  
 
I will never forget the shock, panic and heart break when I learned my dad was killed along with 
13 of his co-workers on December 2, 2015 in San Bernardino, California. 
  
That day my dad, Damian Meins, was attending a mandatory work training event for the San 
Bernardino County Department of Public Health, at the Inland Regional Center. My dad was 
standing by the Christmas tree during a break, when another co-worker and his wife, who had 
pledged allegiance to the terrorist group ISIS, burst through the doors and began shooting. In 
seconds, my dad was shot five times and his life was over. 
 
There are no words to express the profound loss we experienced with my dad’s death. As for 
the economic impact, our family had access to financial support because the shooting occurred 
during a work event and was also deemed a terrorist attack. We received critical resources from 
workers compensation funds, life insurance and the Victim Compensation Fund.  
 
Additionally, the nation came together, and many people were incredibly kind, and generous 
enough to donate to the victims of the San Bernardino attacks through different Go Fund Me 
efforts. With these funds, we were able to hold the funeral for my father and make sure his 
family could attend. However, because of the complex laws surrounding taxation of these 
varying types of monies, my mother has also faced ongoing IRS issues since 2016. She cites 
lost future earnings from my dad as the biggest financial burden, but points out that this cannot 
compare to the emotional toll of losing your high school sweetheart and husband of 36 years in 
such a horrific fashion.  
 
I was fortunate that my own workplace at the time was very supportive and allowed me to stay 
off work for two months. However, as an employee I had to use all my bereavement, sick time 
and vacation time, and after that was exhausted, I went unpaid in order to be with my family as 
we grieved.  
 
However, most Americans who experience gun violence don’t have the same access to 
financial support and donations or flexibility with their employment to pick up the pieces of their 
lives after having been shattered by a bullet.  
 
And although my dad didn’t survive the shooting on December 2, there were dozens of people 
who did and still have the emotional and physical scars.  
 
I have permission to share the experience of Julie who was actually standing next to my dad, 
next to the Christmas tree, when the shooting occurred. She is special to my family because 
she was able to relay the last seconds of my dad’s life to us.   
 
Julie was 50 years old at the time of the shooting. She was shot twice and has had five 
surgeries that left her with significant scar tissue, which causes problems of its own. She has a 
tremendous amount of bullet fragmentation still left in her body, and will forever be concerned 
about lead poisoning.  
 
Though Julie loved her job and her co-workers the shooting effectively ended her career; she 
was never able to return to work. Julie actually thinks she was one of the more fortunate 
survivors because her husband was the main breadwinner in her family. She knows of other 
shooting survivors that shouldered the financial responsibilities of their families or were 
unmarried, and have had far greater financial difficulties. We know of other victims and survivors 
who were forced to cover the costs of medications and counseling services when their requests 
for workers’ compensation were not approved or were delayed in being approved. Many victims 
and survivors have taken medical retirement or are in the process of doing so. Some people just 
resigned because they could not take the ongoing stress as a result of the trauma. The trauma 
has affected survivors’ family and friends, as well, with at least one family member dying by 
suicide since the attack.  
 
Across the country, survivors of gunshot wounds experience difficulties ranging from 
psychological trauma, loss of work, and steep medical costs. One study estimated that between 
2003 and 2013, there was an annual average of 30,617 hospital admissions for firearm injuries 
in the United States. For each admission, average costs ranged from approximately $19,000 
per handgun injury to over $32,000 per assault weapon injury. Even after the immediate hospital 
costs, survivors of gunshot wounds face a lifetime of medical care costs including readmission 
to the hospital and nursing care. Several studies have found that the lifetime costs of providing 
care following a gunshot wound are more than twice the costs of providing acute care. One 
study put the cumulative lifetime costs of treating gunshot wounds incurred in a single year in 
this country at $2.3 billion. 
 
I’ve been living with grief and loss for nearly four years since my dad was ripped from our lives. 
But I have not been standing by silently. As a member of the Everytown Survivor Network, I 
share my story to put a human face on our nation’s gun violence crisis. Our community of 
survivors advocates for change to help ensure that no other family faces the type of tragedy we 
have experienced. 
 
We should all be free to live without the fear of being shot. No one law can stop all gun violence, 
but there’s so much more we must do to keep our families safe. The House of Representatives 
has already passed bipartisan legislation to require background checks on all gun sales and is 
considering a strong Red Flag law. Now, the Senate must act on background checks and pass 
a strong Red Flag bill. 
I am not alone in my support of stronger gun safety laws. We know 95 percent of Americans 
support background checks on all gun sales and 85 percent support Red Flag laws. And every 
day, 100 Americans are shot and killed and hundreds more are wounded. This is not a right or 
left issue, this is a life or death issue.  
 
Thank you for your time and thank you for listening.  "

What type of gun control will actually make us safer? 
 
John R. Lott, Jr. 
President 
Crime Prevention Research Center 
 
Before the Joint Economic Committee of the United States House of Representatives 
and the Senate 
September 18, 2019 
It is important that something be done about mass public shootings, but much of the current 
public discussion isn’t very serious. Proposals are constantly being put forward that would do 
nothing to stop these attacks, and those that would make a difference, despite wide agreement 
by academics, are ignored. 
 
Universal background checks, meaning background checks on the private transfer of guns, have 
been mentioned for years by gun control advocates. It was by far the most frequently 
mentioned proposal by former President Obama.1 But there has not been a single mass public 
shooting this century that such a law would have stopped.2 These laws also have real costs. In 
Washington, DC, for example, it costs $125 to do a background check on a privately transferred 
gun. That may stop the people who are most likely to be victims of violent crimes, often poor 
blacks who live in high crime urban areas, from being able to legally obtain guns for self-
defense. 
 
Assault weapon bans have been studied extensively, but even researchers funded by the 
Clinton administration, which enacted the 1994 federal ban, were unable to find evidence that 
such a ban reduced any type of violence.3 It doesn’t make any sense to ban so-called “military-
style” weapons, when there are other functionally identical semi-automatic hunting rifles 
available. 
 
There’s also no evidence that crime rates were affected by the 1994 federal ban on magazines 
that hold more than 10 bullets. Even the Urban Institute, with funding from the Bill Clinton 
administration, was unable to find any such evidence.4 In that report, criminologists Chris Koper 
and Jeff Roth concluded: “The evidence is not strong enough for us to conclude that there was 
any meaningful effect (i.e., that the effect was different from zero).” Koper and Rother found in 
a 2004 follow-up report: “We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop 
in gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and 
injuriousness of gun violence.” 
 
But while most of the discussion has been focused on policies that won’t stop these attacks, we 
have generally ignored that since 1950 94% of the mass public shootings have taken place in 
areas were law-abiding citizens have been banned from having guns.5 Many academics say 
reducing the number of gun-free-zones – which can leave people as sitting ducks – is an 
important gun policy that could save lives. 
Finally, the last three sections of this testimony address the concern that more guns mean more 
murder and homicide. In fact, as we will see the opposite is more clearly the case. 
1. How to quickly pass Universal Background Checks 
While “universal background checks” – background checks on the private transfer of guns – are 
continually called for after mass public shootings, there’s just one problem with this 
prescription: it would not have stopped any of the mass shootings we have seen in this century. 
And given that drug dealers are a major source of illegal guns, these laws aren’t going to be any 
more successful in stopping criminals from getting guns than we have been in stopping them 
from getting illegal drugs. 
That said, if gun control activists want to get background checks on private transfers passed, 
there are fixes that will attract widespread bipartisan support. 
 
A frequent claim is: Background checks have stopped 3.5 million dangerous or prohibited 
people from buying guns.6 That is simply false.  
 
There have been 3.5 million “initial” denials, but at least 96%, and probably over 99%, of those 
denials are mistakes.7 The system relies largely on identifying phonetically similar names, 
causing false positives that overwhelmingly discriminate against poor and middle-income blacks 
and Hispanics. It’s one thing to stop a felon from buying a gun.8 But it’s quite another to stop 
someone from getting a gun because their name resembles a felon’s.  
 
“This incredibly high rate of false positives imposes a real burden on the most vulnerable 
people,” said Reagan Dunn, the first national coordinator for Project Safe Neighborhoods, a 
Justice Department program started in 2001 to ensure gun laws are enforced.9 
 
If politicians want background checks to stop criminals from getting guns, rather than create 
headline-driving, racially-biased false-positives, there is a simple fix: require that the 
government does background checks in the same way that the government forces private 
companies to do background checks on employees – make them use all the information 
available, including exact names and birthdates.  
 
In New York City and Washington, background checks on private gun transfers cost at least 
$125. These costs present a genuine obstacle to poor people living in high-crime, urban areas. It 
isn’t as though gang members are going to pay these fees, so the burden will fall to law-abiding 
Americans. Democrats who think that voter ID laws are unfairly onerous for poor minorities 
ought to appreciate the obstacles presented by background check fees. 
Besides, if we sincerely believe that background checks reduce crime and save lives, we 
shouldn’t effectively tax Americans for going through the process. If everyone benefits from 
background checks, then everyone should pay for them. They ought to be funded out of 
general revenue.  
Under the Democratic House bill, actions that would be entirely reasonable could become 
criminal. Imagine a stalker threatens a female friend of yours, and she asks to borrow your gun. 
She is trained and has no criminal record. Should you let her protect herself? If Jerry Nadler has 
his way, you could land in prison for doing so. The only exception is “imminent danger,” i.e., if 
she asks to borrow your gun while her stalker is charging at her.  
The Trump administration has floated the idea of an App that could be used to check whether 
people are eligible to buy guns. People would be required to check the app or else face criminal 
consequences. That’s one potential solution. Another: simply requiring a reasonable person 
standard: would a reasonable person believe that the woman being stalked is in danger? 
An App would cut the costs of background checks and also solve problems for rural Americans. 
Private transfer background checks would require some Americans to travel for miles to do 
what could be accomplished instantly with a smart phone.  
Many on the right are worried that universal background checks will be used to create a 
national registry. Ever since the National Instant Criminal Background Check System was set up 
in 1998, the federal government has been prevented from creating a national registry because 
background check information must be destroyed within 24 hours after the completing the 
check.  
Universal background checks be a slippery slope, if, say, five years from now a Democratic 
president requires licensed dealers turn over all that information to the federal government, 
thus creating an instant national registry on all legally owned guns. 
But again, there is a simple solution: just as with the Federal government now, put a time limit 
on how long the licensed dealers must keep this background check information. 
2. Survey of Academic Researchers 
Academic researchers broadly think that eliminating gun-free zones is a promising policy 
change that could save lives. 
Criminologists and economists are the most interested in that solution, while public health 
researchers tend to favor traditional gun control methods. But outside of economists who favor 
eliminating gun-free zones, none of the groups are significantly above the midpoint (5.5) in 
supporting any type of gun control. 
The following chart shows the results of a survey of researchers who had published peer-
reviewed empirical publications on firearms policy were surveyed.10 It was conducted from 
February 18th through March 21st 2019. The survey was the largest yet conducted, with a 
response rate of over 43%, or 120, from the 277 researchers. On a 1-to-10 scale, with 10 being 
very effective and 1 being not effective at all, criminologists, economists, and public health 
researchers were asked 33 different questions on gun control. 
 
3. Assault Weapons Ban 
 
One book titled Rampage Nation by Louis Klarevas has been cited by gun control advocates and 
politicians as showing that an assault weapon ban would work.11 This book’s analysis has not 
been published in any peer reviewed academic journals. A similar analysis by John Donohue 
and Theodora Boulouta has recently been provided in a New York Times op-ed piece.12 
 
Here is a Washington Post graph that makes use of Klarevas’ numbers. Senator Dianne 
Feinstein (D-CA) showed President Trump this diagram when she met with him shortly after the 
Parkland school shooting in Florida in February 2018.13 
 
There are major problems with that analysis. One problem is that these incident and death data 
lump together attacks using both assault weapons and other types of guns. The Assault 
Weapon Ban would only have caused the use of assault weapons to decline during the ban and 
then rise after the ban ended in 2004. In fact, the use of other types of guns would likely to be 
expected to rise during the ban. In fact, while the share of mass public shooting using assault 
weapons fell during the ban, they fell even further in the ten years after the ban ended. 
 
In addition, over time, the rate of mass shootings may rise or fall for many reasons unrelated to 
the assault weapons ban.   
Because of that, few academics would make the types of comparisons that Klarevas makes.   
If a national assault weapons ban had really reduced shootings, then one would expect it to 
have a bigger impact in states that previously lacked such a ban. States that already had a state-
level ban, on the other hand, should see a smaller effect. 
Rigorous, peer-reviewed academic studies compare the trends in these two types of states to 
determine whether the national ban had an effect. That is the way that Koper and Roth did 
their studies, and as I have done so in my own research. These studies did not find any impact 
from assault weapon bans. 
But even Klarevas’ simple methods are dependent on the exact dataset used. The next graph 
uses the Mother Jones data set on Mass Public Shootings to show the small insignificant 
changes in shootings using assault weapons.  The Crime Prevention Research Center has a 
count of mass shootings, and that data indicates no reduction at all in mass public shootings.14 
 
 
 
4. How does the US Compare to other Countries in terms of Mass Public shootings? 
 
We follow the FBI’s definition of mass public shootings.15  The list of all of our 2,818 cases from 
1998 to 2017 is provided on our website.  Of those, 61 occurred in the United States and 2,757 
happened in the rest of the world. While the US had about 4.6 percent of the world’s 
population during this period, it had just 2.16 percent of the mass public shootings.  
Just as we compare crime rates across the United States by adjusting for different state 
populations, we report the population-adjusted rates across countries. It makes no more sense 
to compare the raw number of murders in Wyoming with the number in California than it is to 
compare raw numbers of murders from mass public shootings for the United State and India, a 
country with almost 4 times the US population. 
The United States was host to a still smaller share of people killed in these attacks.  Worldwide 
mass public shooting murders totaled 31,418 people, and the US accounted for 553 (1.8%) of 
these. 
By both measures, the US is substantially below the world average. Per capita, mass public 
shootings occur with 53.9 percent less frequency and result in 32.2 percent fewer casualties.  
The US ranks 66th in attack rate and 56th in murder rate. Norway, Finland, France, and 
Switzerland are major European countries with much higher rates of murder from mass public 
shootings than the United States. Indeed, France’s rate is 49.7 percent higher than the US’s. 
The rates in Pakistan and India are respectively 475% and 13% higher than the US rate.  
 
5. Gun ownership and Mass Public Shootings 
 
The Small Arms Survey16 is regularly used by the press. We combine this estimate of gun 
ownership with the frequency and severity of mass public shootings. 
 
Figures 4B show that the more guns owned in a country, the fewer people killed in mass public 
shootings.  
 
 
 
6. Gun Ownership and Homicide Rates 
 
A very common claim is that countries with the most guns have the highest homicide rates.  
 
But looking at OECD countries, excluding the US, it’s not true that there is an association 
between more guns and more gun deaths. In fact, higher gun ownership rates are associated 
with lower homicide rates. 
 
 
 
 
When we look at all of the surveyed countries, the Small Arms Survey shows an association 
between more guns and fewer homicides.  
 
 
The same is true for the much smaller set of countries that report firearm homicides. 
 
 
 
7. Do Gun Bans Ever Lower Murder Rates? 
 
Every place that has banned guns (either all guns or all handguns) has seen murder rates go up. 
You cannot point to one place where murder rates have fallen, whether Chicago or D.C. or even 
island nations such as England, Jamaica, Ireland, Venezuela, or obscure places such as the 
Solomon Islands.17 
 
Take the handgun ban in England and Wales in January 1997.18 Homicide rates  were in flux 
after the ban, but only one year (2010) had a homicide rate lower than the rate in 1996. The 
immediate effect was about a 50% increase in homicide rates. Firearm homicide rates almost 
doubled between 1996 and 2002. The homicide and firearm homicide rates only began falling 
after a large 8% increase in the number of police officers during just 2003 and 2004.  Despite 
the increase in the number of police, the murder rate still remained slightly higher than the 
immediate pre-ban rate.19 
 
While they haven’t gotten the same attention as UK’s handgun ban, other countries have tried 
banning guns. In order to make useful comparisons, we limit ourselves to countries that have 
crime data both before and after the bans were implemented. My previous work has dealt 
extensively with the dramatic increases in murder rates in Chicago and Washington, DC after 
their handguns went into effect respectively in November 1982 and February 1977. 
  
By August 5, 1972, Ireland required that all privately held pistols, revolvers, and all rifles 
over .22 caliber be surrendered to local police stations.20 Jamaica’s Gun Court Act of 1974 
virtually eliminated the issuing of handgun licenses to civilians.21 In 2012, Venezuela banned 
guns in an “attempt by the government to improve security and cut crime.”22 The Solomon 
Islands banned guns in 1999.23 
 
The Republic of Ireland and Jamaica both experienced large increases in homicide rates after 
enacting handgun bans.24 From 1945 through 1971, Ireland’s homicide rates stayed in the 
relatively narrow range from 0.1 to 0.6 per 100,000 people, with an average of 0.3. After the 
ban, the homicide rates from 1972 to 2012 rarely overlapped with the rates before the ban 
(ranging from 0.4 to 1.8 per 100,000 people), with an average of 0.9. Ireland’s 1974 homicide 
rate spike was quite high even with terrorist attacks subtracted from the total.25 The big 
increase starting in the 1990s was largely due to a rise in drug gangs as recreational drug use 
soared.26 
 
Jamaica’s increase in homicides was even more dramatic than the increase in Ireland. The 
homicide rate is always higher after the ban than it was before, with the average homicide rate 
going from 7.3 per 100,000 during 1967 to 1973 to 31.5 per 100,000 in 1995. Jamaica’s 
explosion in homicides during the 1990s is also directly blamed on drug gangs.27 
 
Similar results can be found for countries from Venezuela to the Solomon Islands.28 
 
8. Conclusion 
 
While we and other criminologists and economists are very skeptical that background checks or 
other types of gun control regulations will reduce either mass public shootings or murder rates, 
we have sketched out some very reasonable changes in the current proposed background 
checks that would quickly get them passed. I have provided these same points to gun control 
groups for 20 years.  
 
The most obvious policy to stop the vast majority of mass public shootings is to eliminate gun-
free zones and encourage people to carry their permitted concealed handgun. 
 
Finally, we have shown that despite the common belief, more guns do mean less murder.

This is the same definition that was used by Lott and Landes (2001) and the work done by the Crime Prevention 
Research Center.   
We looked at attacks from 1970 to 2017 (Global Terrorism Database, 2017 and LaFree et al, 2015).  
Crime Prevention Research Center. See also Lott and Landes (2003) and Lott (2010). The only categories that 
sometimes meet our criteria for mass public shootings are “terrorism”, “other crime type,” and “intra/inter-group 
conflict.” Government sponsored or directed/ordered killings or state terrorism (the “State Actor” category) are 
completely excluded.  
We then reviewed each case using Nexis and web searches to determine whether they met our definition. Less than 
50% of the terrorism shooting cases identified by the GTD met the definition of mass public shootings.  
Over the twenty years studied here, the GTD also misses 39 cases in Europe.15 The GTD also missed all of the cases 
for some countries such as the Solomon Islands. 
                                                                                                                                                                                   
To obtain these additional cases missed by the GTD, at the CPRC we used our own Nexis and web searches for mass 
shootings for Europe and the United States and for large-scale mass public shootings where at least 15 people were 
killed. We have also hired people who can speak Chinese, French, Polish, Russian, and Spanish. 
16 The Small Arms Survey is the most commonly cited source for data on gun ownership rates, with claims that the 
United States has by far the highest level of gun ownership, with 88.8 guns per 100 people. Unfortunately, the only 
citations that the Small Arms Survey offers are to the European Union Survey on gun ownership rates and in email 
discussions they point to the International Crime Victimization Survey (ICVS).16 The EU survey covers only 28 
countries in the European Union. The ICVS only covers five countries past 2005, and those are all countries that are 
already in the later EU survey. The only other information has been that they rely on gun ownership numbers, not 
gun possession numbers, for Israel and Switzerland, though no sources were provided.

These comments and opinions are my own and do not reﬂect those of my employer.

The title you gave this committee is “Gun Violence Prevention Research:  Reducing the Costs 
of Gun Violence on Youth, Communities, and the Economy.” I am here to make sure you also 
consider the high cost of Gun Control in your discussions. While I’m sure you are considering 
spending millions in taxpayer money to further gun control measures, don’t forget about the 
billions of dollars responsible gun owners put INTO the economy.

I was not raised in a house with guns. Growing up, no one in my immediate family was a 
hunter, although I support hunting. However, I WAS raised in a home in which my father was an 
expert on the founding of the country, so I fully understood the reasons behind the Second 
Amendment since childhood. I ﬁrmly believe that it is the lack of teaching history in our current 
public education system that has us here today, in the current debate.

That being said, I was gifted a handgun by a veterinarian friend, with full support of my family, 
when I became an adult and moved into my own place. Some years later, I had a patient who 
was an assistant District Attorney in Houston who actually convinced me to start carrying the 
gun in my purse, illegally. At that time, in the state of Texas, we did not have concealed carry 
available to us. He said something like, “Suzanna, you don’t see the bad stuﬀ. I see it everyday. 
No police oﬃcer will bother you.”

Several years later, in 1991, my parents and I accepted a lunch invitation from my manager 
friend of a Luby’s cafeteria. It was Boss’s Day, so the place was packed, but we enjoyed our 
meal and sipped coﬀee when my friend left to check on the kitchen.  Suddenly, a pickup truck 
came crashing through the ﬂoor-to-ceiling window, knocking a number of tables over as he 
came to a stop. Of course, we all thought it was an accident and I stood up to help the people 
he had injured. But then we heard gunshots. My father and I immediately got down on the ﬂoor 
and put the table up in front of us. My mother was down behind us. Almost everyone else in 
the restaurant got on the ﬂoor as well. The guy kept shooting. He was on the other side of the 
truck from us initially, so it wasn’t immediately clear who or what he was shooting at. I kept 
waiting to hear him say something like, “Everyone put your wallets on the table.” But he didn’t. 
As he came around the front of his vehicle, I saw him take aim at a patron on the ﬂoor in front 
of him, and pull the trigger. Then he moved to the next victim, took aim, and pulled the trigger. 
Slowly, and deliberately. Execution style. He had complete control of the room.

It took me a good 45 seconds from the time I heard the ﬁrst gunshots to realize that this guy 
was just there to kill people. Remember, it was 1991 and these mass shootings weren’t 
happening with any frequency at that time. (And when they did, we didn’t have a 24/7 news 
cycle constantly repeating the story.)

When I realized what was happening, I reached for my purse on the ground next to me. The 
murderer stood maybe 15 feet from me, I had the upturned table on which to prop my arm.

Then I realized that I had made the stupidest mistake of my life:  my gun was out in my car in 
the parking lot, completely useless to me. A few months earlier, I had chosen to obey the law 
and leave my gun in the car in case I broke down on a back road somewhere. When the 
realization sunk in, I thought, “Great. What do I do now? Throw my purse at him?”  At that 
point my father took my attention saying, “I’ve got to do something! I’ve got to do something! 
He’s going to kill everyone in here!” I grabbed him by the shirt collar and said, “Stay down, or 
he’ll kill you too.” But when he saw what he thought was a chance, he got up from his 
crouched position behind the table and ran at the guy. The gunman had total control at that 
point. My Dad covered perhaps half the distance when the killer simply turned, and shot him in 
the chest. My Dad went down in the aisle maybe 7 or 8 feet from me. He was still alive and still 
conscious, but as terrible as it sounds, I saw the wound and wrote him oﬀ at that point.  The 
good news is that it made the gunman change directions slightly. Instead of continuing directly 
toward me, he veered oﬀ to my left and continued executing patrons. A few moments later I 
heard a window break at the opposite end of the room. A hero had kicked out a window and 
provided an escape. At that point, the gunman lost some control and pandemonium erupted 
with people rushing to get out. We were trapped in a front corner, but I peeked over the 
upturned table, and when his back was momentarily turned, I stood up, grabbed my mother by 
the shirt collar and said, “Come on! Come on! We’ve got to run! We’ve got to get out of here.”

At that point, my feet grew wings. I ran out through the back window. Once outside, I turned to 
say something to my mother, and realized she had not followed me out.

To shorten this up, I found out exactly what happened next from the law enforcement oﬃcers 
who were in a conference at a hotel just one building away. Several of them had been patients 
of mine, and they told me that in an odd twist of gun control fate, the manager of the 
conference hotel had asked them to store their weapons in their vehicles so as not to “upset” 
the other hotel patrons. They said it took precious minutes to retrieve their guns from the trunks 
of their cars before running to the scene. There were bodies everywhere, and they couldn’t 
immediately identify the shooter. But they did see a woman kneeling in the aisle, cradling a 
mortally wounded man. They saw a younger man walk up to her. He put a gun to her head as 
she looked up. She put her head down, and he pulled the trigger. THAT is how they knew who 
the shooter was. They said all they had to do was shoot a round into the ceiling and the guy 
ran to the bathroom alcove area, exchanged a few shots with them, and then put a bullet into 
his own brain.

Twenty three people were killed that day, including my parents. My folks had just had their 47th 
wedding anniversary two weeks prior, and it didn’t occur to me as I ran away that my mother 
wasn’t going anywhere without my father.

It was the largest mass shooting to that point in this nation’s history.

You can check my quotes from the next few days’ newspapers. The story hasn’t changed. I am 
not mad at the guy who did it. To me, that is like being mad at a rabid dog...you don’t get mad 
at it, you take it behind the barn and kill it.  But I was MAD AS HELL at my legislators, whom I 
felt had legislated me out of the right to protect myself and my family. The ONLY thing gun 
control did that day, was provide a target rich environment for a guy who wanted to rack up a 
high body bag count. Gun control served us up like ﬁsh in a barrel.

                                             ———————————————-

You want to talk about the cost of gun violence? Well, I can tell you the cost of gun control on 
October 16th, 1991: my parents and twenty two other innocent lives, several of whom had 
dutifully left their guns in their cars to comply with the law.

                                              ———————————————

Is having a gun a guarantee? Of course not. My gun could have jammed (a revolver at the time, 
so not likely). I could have missed (true, but I’ve hit much smaller targets at much greater 
distances). The one thing you can’t really deny, is that IT WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE ODDS.

These creeps rarely go to places where places where people can defend themselves. They go 
where they can rack up a high body bag count, and that is where good people, family people, 
can’t ﬁght back.

Since that day in ‘91, we have seen many, many more of these terrible events. And the vast 
majority of them have occurred in places where guns are not allowed and good people are not 
allowed to protect themselves. Restaurants, post oﬃces, schools, daycares, dance clubs, 
theaters, print shops. Nearly every one of them had a sign depicting a red circle with a line 
through a handgun. Explain this to me: if guns are the problem, then why haven’t we seen any 
of these mass shootings at NRA conventions, skeet and trap competitions, or the dreaded gun 
show...places where there are thousands of guns in the hands of law abiding citizens? 

I know some of you immediately think of the Las Vegas shooting, knowing my little handgun 
wouldn’t have made a lick of diﬀerence. And you would be right. If it makes you feel better to 
ban bump stocks, then ban bump stocks. But don’t believe for a moment that such a law 
would have stopped that maniac from murdering helpless event-goers. It doesn’t take much of 
an imagination to think of several other options he could have taken. I wonder how many 
people he could have killed with a hunting riﬂe and a handmade suppressor. With so many 
people in the crowd it would have taken an eternity for them to ﬁgure out that they were being 
shot at, especially if he scattered his shots. And if he REALLY wanted to get those body bags, 
all he had to do was grab one of the two private planes he kept at the airport about a mile 
away, and ﬂy it straight up through the crowd and into the stage. That would have likely taken 
out hundreds! Again, a handgun is not a guarantee, it just changes the odds in many situations.

The lack of simple logic used in some of the past legislation amazes me. Why do we trust a 
school teacher to carry her weapon at the grocery store amongst dozens of families and babies 
in strollers. Yet, when she crosses the street and enters her school where she works, (a place 
that has become a magnet for these shooters), society no longer trusts her. But for “extra 
security,” we’ll spend money putting up lots of extra cameras. (That way we we can see the 
carnage from diﬀerent angles.)

I am no expert on ﬁrearms. But I have learned over the years that many educated people, 
including reporters, and legislators do not know what a semi-automatic is. A lawyer from 
California said to my grown son, “Why do you think we want to take away YOUR guns? ...But 
surely you don’t think regular people should have semi-automatics!?” She, and most reporters 
I’ve encountered, think a semi-automatic is in eﬀect a rapid ﬁre, machine gun type weapon. 
Those are AUTOMATICS, and have been illegal without special license since the 1930’s. Semi-
automatics shoot one bullet at a time, only as fast as you can repeatedly pull the trigger, and 
nearly every single woman I know carries a semi-automatic pistol in her purse. So yes, dear 
lawyer, you ARE talking about taking our guns.

So if you want to make a diﬀerence, you can start by speaking truthfully and accurately, 
without misleading rhetoric. Next, you could rid  us of public gun-free zones. No guarantee, but 
again, it changes the odds. Defensive uses of guns are estimated at between 2.2 to 2.5 million 
annually (that estimate coming from a self-proclaimed “liberal” professor who didn’t own a gun 
at the time, Dr. Gary Kleck).

Here’s an idea for legislation, since everyone is anxious to “do something.” Create a law that 
makes it crystal clear that if a property/business owner/employer strips people of their right to 
protect themselves (by disallowing concealed or open carry), that he or she becomes not only 
responsible for your safety, but ﬁnancially liable as well. Should a bad guy come in and shoot 
or otherwise harm people then they have failed in their end of an implied contract. In those 
cases, I believe there is culpability similar to what we currently use in child endangerment laws. 
I can promise that if something ever happens to any of my loved ones in a place that has 
disarmed them, that I will sue the pants oﬀ of that entity to make the point.

Universal background checks, in my opinion, are not the answer. I am a ﬁrm believer that this 
becomes de facto registration. And registration always, always, ALWAYS leads to conﬁscation.

For years I have proposed that media quit using the killer’s name or picture, with the 
understanding that it only gloriﬁes the murderer. I am happy to say that it is now common 
practice. So positive changes can be made.

The next positive change could be ﬂeshed out through a task force. My husband is a criminal 
psychologist who recently gave a brief description of how we could prevent many (but of 
course not all) of these mass shootings. He believes that most of the killers are not mentally ill, 
but with proper threat assessment, tracking, and treatment, many ideations would be thwarted 
without the need for any signiﬁcant changes to current law. We have heard so many stories 
where relatives of these killers reached out to law enforcement or others ahead of time. We 
have said, “If you see something, say something.” But there is currently no cohesive system to 
follow through on the concerns.  So the next phase in the evolution is to create that cohesive 
system to give law enforcement, mental health, and other members of society the tools they 
need to properly follow up on these concerns and prevent these terrible events.

 A plan would look something like this (and much is already currently in place, but not being 
used):  someone could call in with a concern that you are a threat to others. A specially trained 
investigator would be dispatched to do a threat assessment. We currently do risk 
assessments, but these are easily lied through or worked around. I’m talking about a much 
more comprehensive threat assessment. Currently, an individual may refuse to cooperative, 
but with probable cause, that person can be detained as a credible threat to society. Virtually 
every state already allows for detention even without cause for up to 24 hours, but with a 
credible threat, most, if not all, states allow for even longer detention. During that time, a higher 
level evaluation would be performed by a designated multidisciplinary Statewide Task Force. If 
the task force determines a person to be a credible and imminent threat, then a myriad of 
existing legal charges and mental health services could be deployed that would allow the 
individual to be monitored and tracked until such a time as the treat has decreased. Current 
laws already exist for probation and court-ordered mental health treatment. Why not employ 
these tools that already exist in a cohesive and coordinated eﬀort to lower the risk and still 
protect individual rights and Constitutional freedoms? Events such as those at Walmart, 
Parkland, Sandy Hook, Sutherland Springs, Midland-Odessa, and others would likely have 
been thwarted with this approach.

In the end, the title given to this hearing in part is “...Reducing the Costs of Gun Violence...” 
While attempting to stop violence as a whole is a worthy cause, I ﬁnd it pointless to focus on 
the tool. A gun can be used to kill a family. A gun can be use to protect a family. It’s just a tool.

By the way, an estimated 350 million guns in America didn’t hurt anyone this year. THAT is a 
staggering statistic.

CONGRESSWOMAN CAROLYN B. MALONEY  
 
 
Opening Statement  
Gun Violence in America  
Understanding and Reducing the Costs of  
Firearm Injuries and Deaths  
 
September 18, 2019  
  
  
Thank you all for being here today.  
 
And I’d especially like to thank our witnesses, some of whom have lost family members to gun 
violence. And as we talk about the costs of gun violence, let us never forget that the biggest, 
most tragic cost it the loss of human life. 
 
I believe that Congress must act to help stem the gun violence epidemic in our country. 
 
In 2017 alone, almost 40,000 people were killed by guns in this country. Firearms are now the 
leading cause of death in young adults. Our gun homicide rate for teens and young adults is 
nearly 50 times higher than other high-income countries. And ninety percent of all the women 
killed by firearms in high-income countries are killed in the United States.  
 
In August alone, more than 50 lives were taken in a series of horrible massacres.  
So far this year, there have been 301 mass shootings – that's more than one per day.  
 
 
And yet – unbelievably – some people say that the real problem here is that we don’t have 
enough guns.  
 
They say that the only thing that will make America safer is more guns. But the fact is that if 
more guns made us safer we already would be the safest country in the world.  
 
In the United States, there are more guns in civilian hands than any other country in the world. 
An American is nearly seven times more likely than someone in Canada to die by a gun, eight 
times more likely than someone in France, almost twenty times more likely than a person in 
Germany and almost forty times more likely than someone in the UK, Australia or New Zealand, 
and nearly two hundred times more than someone in Japan.  
  
More people in the United States died from firearm-related injuries from 2003 to 2012 than the 
entire number of combat fatalities in World War II.  
 
There is no way to estimate “cost of a human” life. The loss is incalculable. 
 
But there is also economic cost – a lost breadwinner’s income, astronomical medical costs, costs 
to employers, schools, police, hospitals and the criminal justice system.  
Opening Statement FINAL 
 
 
In order to help people better understand those costs, I’ve asked my staff to produce a report that 
compiles data on the economic costs of gun violence in all 50 states.  
 
The report finds that: 
 
•  Rural states have the highest costs of gun violence measured as a share of their 
economies. 
•  States with high rates of gun ownership have the highest rates of gun suicide. 
•  The three largest states suffer the largest absolute costs. 
•  High youth death rates from gun violence extend across region. 
 
In contrast, my state of New York, which has stricter gun laws including an assault weapons ban, 
has one of the three lowest costs of gun violence as a share of its economy, along with Hawaii 
and Massachusetts.  
 
There are three people in this room today - who have suffered heart wrenching losses as a 
result of gun violence.  
 
One of our witnesses, Tina Meins, lost her father in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, 
California in 2015. Dr. Suzanna Hupp, who also is testifying, lost both her parents in a mass 
shooting at a restaurant in Texas in 1991. And Sheneé Johnson, seated in the first row, lost both 
a fiancée and her son to gun violence.  
 
We must fight to lower the risk that other families are forced to bear such suffering. 
 
Other countries have drastically reduced gun violence – because they found the courage to act. 
 
In Australia, in 1996, after a man with an assault rifle killed 35 people - the parliament 
responded by banning automatic and semiautomatic weapons and created a buyback program 
that resulted in 650,000 weapons being turned in. That’s political courage.  
 
In New Zealand, in 2019, after 51 people were killed at the Christchurch mosque - 
the parliament acted, voting nearly unanimously to outlaw automatic 
and semiautomatic weapons. That’s guts… the kind that the U.S. Congress has lacked for many 
years.  
 
In fact, in 1996, Congress made things worse.  
 
It passed legislation that effectively blocked all federal funding for gun violence research at the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  
 
Page 2 
Opening Statement FINAL 
That is why we have gone more than 20 years without substantially deepening our knowledge 
about gun violence prevention and about what we can do to end this epidemic.  
  
This year the Democratic House acted to address this crisis. 
   
We passed the first gun safety reforms in 25 years. 
  
The bill requires universal background checks, closes the gun show loophole, and gives the FBI 
more time to conduct life-saving background checks. 
  
This summer, the House passed another bill, one that I have spent years fighting for, to invest 
$50 million to conduct research on how to reduce gun violence. 
   
And last week, the House Judiciary Committee sent to the full House a ban on high capacity 
magazines, “red flag” legislation, and a bill to prohibit those who commit misdemeanor hate 
crimes from obtaining a gun. 
  
These are common sense measures that the vast majority of Americans strongly support.  
  
It’s time for change. 
 
I look forward to a day when our children don’t have to be afraid to go to school. 
When our teachers don’t learn how to treat gunshot wounds. When nearly half of Americans 
aren’t worried about being a victim in a mass shooting. And when those who hold the reins 
of power move beyond hollow offers of “thoughts and prayers.” 
 
Let us honor the victims of gun violence and their families by working to prevent more victims. 
Let us – like other countries in the developed world – turn tragedy into bold action.  
 
And may all Members of Congress, especially those in the Senate, find the courage to act. 
 
I look forward to our witnesses’ testimony this afternoon.

Opening Statement  
JEC Hearing on “Gun Violence in America: 
Understanding and Reducing the Cost of Firearm 
Injuries and Deaths” 
September 18, 2019, 2:15pm 
210 Cannon House Office Building 
 
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for this 
hearing of the Joint Economic Committee.  
Over the past several weeks, Americans have watched in 
horror, again and again, as our fellow human beings—
young and old—have been murdered in high-profile mass 
shootings on our soil. As lawmakers, it is not enough for 
us to grieve these losses.  
It is our responsibility, first, to understand what is causing 
these horrific events, as well as the many other tragic 
deaths by gun violence that take place in our country 
every year. And then, it is our responsibility to find any 
policies that may help prevent tragedies like these in the 
future—so long as these policies are faithful to our 
1 
 
Constitution, and do not inadvertently harm the very 
citizens we are trying to protect. 
Mass shootings attract our attention because they have 
such power to inspire fear. When innocent people are 
gunned down at random and in public, we wonder whether 
we could be next. And our media, obsessed with their click 
count and viewership, too often choose to fan these fears 
rather than portray the truth about the terrible problem of 
gun violence in this country. Studies have suggested that 
this irresponsible media coverage may actually increase 
the number of mass shootings by encouraging potential 
killers in their sick desire for attention.  
The reality of gun violence in America is less sensational 
than what we see in the media, but no less horrible. Six in 
ten gun deaths are suicides. In 2017, for every victim of a 
mass shooting, there were 88 victims of gun suicide and 
another 52 victims of other forms of gun homicide. Mental 
illness, spiritual emptiness, and a breakdown in family and 
community life are the underlying causes of much of our 
gun violence epidemic—including even mass shootings.  
2 
 
Mass shooters seek to inflict on others the pain, fear, and 
inner torment that they are already suffering themselves. 
They often come from broken homes and distressed 
neighborhoods. The JEC’s Social Capital Project has 
ranked American counties by the health of their family and 
community life, and has found that half of identified mass 
shooters come from the bottom quarter of counties. The 
evil committed by these murderers must be stopped, but 
we must also seek to uproot its causes. 
Millions of law-abiding citizens use guns to protect 
themselves, their families, and their communities, just as 
our founders intended. The Constitution protects our right 
to bear arms because if that right were abridged, we would 
become more dependent for security on our police and our 
military. And it is no criticism of our police and military to 
say that this would ultimately leave us less secure, not 
more. Some Americans have suffered tragedy precisely 
when they were prevented from exercising their right to 
bear arms, as we will soon hear from the personal story of 
Dr. Suzanna Hupp. And when we do enact gun-control 
3 
 
laws, we know that criminals are all too happy to ignore 
them. One study found that 79% of guns recovered from 
crime scenes were possessed unlawfully. 
This does not mean that we have no ways to keep guns 
out of the hands of criminals and, especially, the mentally 
ill. Our state governments have proposed several 
worthwhile innovations, including those that make it easier 
for local law enforcement to act swiftly on reports of the 
suspicious activities that can precede a mass shooting. 
There is room for reform in our federal statutes as well: for 
example, we could improve local agencies’ reporting to 
our National Instant Criminal Background Check System 
for firearms purchases. 
Many Americans, including some of our witnesses, have 
borne in their own lives the unspeakable costs of gun 
violence. It is important for Congress to listen to their 
voices. I hope that this committee can present to the rest 
of our country a model for respectful conversation about 
some very difficult topics, so that we can work together to 
reduce the number of lives lost to gun violence.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE LEE, CHAIRMAN, A U.S. 
SENATOR FROM UTAH 
Chairman Lee. Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for 
being here and joining us today for this hearing of the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee. 
The American economy is thriving. The current economic expan-
sion is the longest in U.S. history. Our unemployment rate has re-
mained below 4 percent over the last 18 months. In recent years 
we have seen consistently solid GDP growth, and growth in job cre-
ation. 
And  yet,  notwithstanding  these  successes,  for  many  parents 
across this country raising a family has become harder and more 
expensive than ever before. The New York Times in fact recently 
reported that based on the surveyed adults between the ages of 20 
to 45 who were parents or who planned to be, they discovered some 
interesting trends: 
One in four had fewer children, or expected during their lifetimes 
they would have fewer children than they considered to be within 
the range of ideal. Economic concerns were foremost among the 
reasons that they either fell short or believed that in the future 
they would fall short of what they considered ideal. 
Over the past few years, the Joint Economic Committee’s Social 
Capital Project has been documenting trends in what we refer to 
‘‘our associational life as Americans.’’ That is, the web of social re-
lationships through which we as Americans pursue various endeav-
ors—our families, our communities, our friendships, our religious 
congregations, for example.

A critical source of meaning and social capital is, of course, the 
family.  In  fact,  it  is  the  central  set  of  headwaters  for  social 
connectiveness generally. That is why two of the project’s main pol-
icy objectives are making it more affordable to raise a family, and 
increasing the number of children who are raised by happily mar-
ried parents. 
The goals of today’s hearing are to examine factors affecting fam-
ily affordability and to explore policy approaches that might allow 
for more Americans to start and to raise the families that they de-
sire. 
Increasingly, family affordability has become a unifying concern 
among lawmakers and policymakers and commentators of both the 
political Right and of the political Left and everything in between. 
We hear it even in discussions around topics that are as varied as 
the Child Tax Credit, declining fertility rates, increases in the cost 
of child care and of housing, paid family leave, and student debt 
burdens. 
Motivating all these discussions is a simple statement: It should 
not be this hard to raise a family. 
The problem is of course multi-faceted. It is complex. It is dif-
ficult  to  unravel  and  to  understand  completely.  Economic  chal-
lenges such as debt loads, and increases in the cost of living make 
family formation and expansion difficult for many Americans. 
Even many families that are economically stable have to deal 
with the challenges of balancing work and family. Parents want to 
afford the best neighborhoods and schools for their children, but 
that often leads to too little time to spend with them—less time, 
at least, than they would prefer. 
As more families have sent two earners into the workforce, em-
ployers have been slow to accommodate their desire for work/life 
balance. 
Meanwhile, Americans who might prefer something closer to a 
single-breadwinner  family  face  prices  for  housing  and  other  ex-
penses that are bid up by dual-earner households, and the growing 
ranks of single parents are hampered by their correspondingly high 
poverty rates. 
The answer to ‘‘How did we get here?’’ is complicated. Our first 
step must be to adequately diagnose the problems facing our fami-
lies. What fuels the rising costs of health care? Of child care? Of 
education? And of housing? How many people are hindered in fam-
ily formation and expansion by excessive student loan debt and in-
adequate income, or poor employment prospects? 
To  what  extent  does  declining  fertility  reflect  changing  pref-
erences, economic barriers, or other factors? And does the rise of 
the dual-earner family signal increasing hardship or simply chang-
ing values? 
The next step must be to come up with some solutions. What is 
the best way to help more families afford time out of the work force 
to care for newborns? Are there ways to increase work/family flexi-
bility that are minimally disruptive to employers, and less likely 
than others to discourage job creation? 
Of the government policies that unintentionally have contributed 
to increases in the cost of housing, of higher education, and health 
care, which of those can be reformed?

How can we make the Tax Code fairer to parents who bear the 
costs of supporting future generations of Americans? How is it that 
we can make sure that we have the workforce and the taxpayer 
base necessary to fund not only the programs of today but the pro-
grams of 20, 30, 40 years from now? 
Our panelists today will discuss some of these topics, and more. 
I look forward to their testimonies and to a productive conversation 
aimed at helping parents and strengthening our families. 
I now recognize Vice Chair Maloney for her opening remarks. 
[The prepared statement of Chairman Lee appears in the Sub-
missions for the Record on page 44.] 
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY, VICE 
CHAIR, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM NEW YORK 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you so much to our panelists and 
Chairman Lee for calling this hearing. Nothing is more important 
than our families. And thank you for shining a spotlight on the 
challenges facing American families. 
We can agree there is a problem. Today, millions of American 
families are working longer and harder not to get ahead but just 
to stay in place. And over the past four decades, wages have been 
stuck or have barely increased. Meanwhile, the cost of child care, 
education, housing, and other necessities for families has grown. 
Most families rely on two incomes just to make ends meet, be-
cause that is what it takes to support an American family today. 
Nearly 40 percent of American adults report that they or their fam-
ilies  have  trouble  paying  for  at  least  one  basic  need,  like  food, 
health care, housing, or utilities. The picture is no brighter when 
you look at specific costs. Take child care. The average cost of cen-
ter-based infant care is more than one-quarter of median household 
income for single working parents. 
That means that those who need child care the most cannot af-
ford it. Or look at college education, which is almost a necessity in 
today’s  economy—I  would  say  it  is  a  necessity—but  since  the 
1980s, the average cost of a full-time undergraduate degree has 
more than tripled for public and private institutions. 
Today’s typical graduate leaves college with $30,000 in debt. Or 
look at housing. Home prices are higher than ever, and often out 
of reach. And over one-third of renters spend more than 30 percent 
of their overall income on rent. 
How  are  families  responding  to  stagnant  wages  and  growing 
costs? By taking on debt. Consumer debt, excluding mortgages, is 
now $4 trillion, the highest level ever, adjusting after inflation. 
Folks are also putting off home ownership, which can deprive 
them  of  a  key  source  of  wealth  accumulation.  Everyone  in  this 
room agrees that it is more expensive than ever to raise a family, 
but we may disagree about the causes, and we may disagree about 
the solutions. 
I welcome the robust discussion that this Committee provides. 
The entrance of women in the workforce is not a problem. We may 
hear that Americans got married less frequently or later in life as 
women  took  on  careers,  and  that  has  hurt  fertility  rates,  but 
women have become key drivers of our economic success.

Women’s earnings boost the economy by trillions of dollars, and 
are critical to American families. Women’s share of household earn-
ings  increased  from  36  percent  in  1993  to  45  percent  in  2016. 
Women could do even more if we made it easier for them to enter 
and stay in the workplace and had more flexibility, as the Chair-
man mentioned, at the workplace. 
There  are  two  key,  overwhelmingly  popular  ways  to  do  that: 
Offer affordable child care and paid leave for the birth of a child, 
and for other reasons such as illness. 
Let’s take a lesson from other OECD countries that provide these 
services and have significantly higher female labor force participa-
tion. And while we are at it, let us make sure that women are paid 
fairly so they have strong incentives to work. 
On average, a woman working full-time year-round earns just 82 
percent of her male counterpart for the same. For Black and His-
panic  women,  it  is  far  worse.  For  far  too  many,  the  American 
Dream is slipping away, or is completely out of reach. 
Some would say that the solution is for the Federal Government 
to do nothing. I disagree. It has a key role to play in helping to 
restore that dream. 
What can it do? What can Congress do? Let us start by lifting 
the minimum wage. The House has passed legislation to lift the 
wage to $15 by 2025 and give 33 million Americans a raise. It is 
time for the Senate to follow suit. 
We should expand programs and initiatives that we know work, 
like the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Child Tax Credit. The 
EITC fees substantially increase employment among single moth-
ers and reduce poverty levels for their families. 
We should make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable to allow 
the poorest families to receive the full benefit. The Working Fami-
lies Tax Relief Act, which expands both the EITC and CTC, would 
benefit 49 million children, including 2.7 million from my home 
State of New York. 
And we should strengthen the Supplemental Nutrition Assist-
ance Program (SNAP). SNAP not only provides a healthy founda-
tion for America’s current and future workforce, it is also an invest-
ment in our economy. Every dollar of SNAP generates more than 
one-and-a-half dollars in increased GDP. 
And finally, we should join the rest of the world and promote 
paid leave for the birth of a child. There are only two countries in 
the world that do not provide paid leave for the birth of a child: 
America and Papua New Guinea. And my bill, which was included 
in the National Defense Authorization Act that passed the House 
this summer, is a good start. It would provide 12 weeks of paid 
leave to Federal employees, a model for the rest of the country to 
follow, hopefully, after the birth or adoption of a child, or to care 
for a family member who has serious illness, or for illness yourself. 
Raising a family is hard and rewarding work. We need to do 
more to provide workers with tools to balance their work and fam-
ily responsibilities. 
I appreciate the Chairman’s statement on flex time, how that 
would be very helpful for families. Today’s hearing and our wit-
nesses’ testimony will shed light on the actions we can take to 
make raising a family more affordable. It is incredibly important

And I yield back. 
[The prepared statement of Vice Chair Maloney appears in the 
Submissions for the Record on page 44.] 
Chairman Lee. Thank you, Vice Chair Maloney. I would now 
like to introduce our distinguished panel of witnesses. Before I do 
that, I want to just address a couple of housekeeping matters. 
This is a Joint Committee of both Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives and of the Senate. As fate would have it, both the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives have decided to call votes 
right in the middle of this hearing. And so you may see Members 
of the House and of the Senate leaving and coming back. That has 
nothing to do with anything other than the responsibility to con-
tinue to vote while our colleagues are voting. Members of this Com-
mittee, particularly those who are here, are very interested in this 
hearing. We will be here for every bit of time that we possibly can. 
I did not want anyone to be alarmed when they see Members fil-
tering in and out. 
Okay, I would like to introduce our witnesses now. First we have 
Mr. Lyman Stone who is an Adjunct Fellow at the American Enter-
prise Institute, and Research Fellow at the Institute for Family 
Studies. Mr. Stone has written on migration population dynamics 
and regional economics. His work has been covered in The New 
York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and 
numerous local outlets. Welcome, Mr. Stone. 
Next we have Mr. Ryan Bourne, who is the R. Scharf Chair for 
the Public Understanding of Economics at the Cato Institute. Prior 
to his role at Cato, Mr. Bourne was head of public policy at the In-
stitute of Economic Affairs and head of Economic Research at the 
Center for Policy Studies in the U.K. Mr. Bourne has written on 
a number of economic issues such as fiscal policy inequality, min-
imum wages, and rent control. And he has appeared on BBC News, 
CNN, and Sky News. He also writes weekly columns for the Daily 
Telegraph and the London paper City AM. Thank you for being 
with us, Mr. Bourne. 
Next we have Dr. Jane Waldfogel, who is the Compton Founda-
tion  Centennial  Professor  for  the  Prevention  of  Children’s  and 
Youth Problems at Columbia University School of Social Work, and 
the Co-Director of the Columbia Population Research Center. Dr. 
Waldfogel has written extensively on the impact of public policy, on 
the well-being of children and families. Her work has focused on 
work-family policies, inequality in early childhood care and edu-
cation, poverty, social mobility, and the Black-White achievement 
gap. She is the author of eight books, and has published numerous 
articles  in  peer-reviewed  academic  journals.  Welcome,  Dr. 
Waldfogel. 
And we have Ms. Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, who is the CEO/Exec-
utive  Director  and  Co-Founder  of  an  organization  called 
MomsRising. Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner has been involved in public pol-
icy and grassroots engagement for over two decades, and has re-
ceived numerous awards for her work. She is also an award-win-
ning author of books and articles, a frequent public speaker, media 
contributor, and host of the Radio Program Breaking Through with

Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, powered by MomsRising. Thank you, Ms. 
Rowe-Finkbeiner. 
We thank all of you for joining us today. We look forward to 
hearing your testimony and we will now hear from you in the order 
in which you were introduced. 
Go ahead, Mr. Stone. 
STATEMENT OF MR. LYMAN STONE, ADJUNCT FELLOW, AMER-
ICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, RESEARCH FELLOW, INSTI-
TUTE FOR FAMILY STUDIES, WILMORE, KY 
Mr. Stone. [Off microphone]. 
Chairman Lee. Just hit the button until it turns red. 
Mr. Stone. Thank you. It is an honor to be here. Thank you for 
inviting me, Mr. Chairman, and Ms. Vice Chairman. It is an honor 
to be here today to testify on topics that are important to American 
families. 
I am affiliated with the American Enterprise Institute, the Insti-
tute for Family Studies; however, for my testimony today the views 
offered are solely my own. Most of my written testimony discusses 
fairly concrete questions of family affordability. And the upshot is 
that, contrary to popular narratives, child rearing in America is not 
really that much more expensive than in the past. Some elements 
of raising a family have gotten more expensive, but the evidence 
suggests that the problem facing families is not simply a budget 
crunch. 
According to a wide variety of surveys, the average American 
woman says she wants to have around 2.3 to 2.5 children. This 
value has been approximately stable for 30 years. And yet, if cur-
rent birth rates hold, the average young American woman today 
will only end up having about 1.7 children. That means that for 
every 10 women in America, there will be about 6 missing children. 
This is a new problem. From 1990 to 2007 the fertility gap was 
consistently just one-third as large. So what is going on? Instead 
of  affordability,  we  should  be  discussing  achievability.  What  is 
holding people back from having the family they reliably say they 
want in surveys? The answer is basically marriage. 
Increasingly postponed marriage can account for at least half of 
the increase in the fertility gap over the last decade, and virtually 
100 percent of the increase since 2000. But incentivizing marriage 
is a tricky question in a diverse society. 
Americans  are  justifiably  uncomfortable  with  being  lectured 
about getting hitched by anyone, especially the Federal Govern-
ment. But luckily there are some good policy options available. 
First of all, it must be said the Federal Government already has 
a marriage policy. And that policy is this: Working class people 
should  not  get  married,  but  middle  class  and  wealthy  people 
should. 
This is the policy stance of the Tax Code, of our welfare pro-
grams, of almost everything the government does. The Tax Code 
gives you a handy marriage bonus if you have a CEO in the family, 
as their spouse is unlikely to earn an equivalent amount and our 
tax brackets are of greatest benefit to families with the most lop- 
sided spousal incomes.

But if you get the EITC, getting married could reduce your ben-
efit by thousands of dollars. For two working class people with 
similar incomes, there is a very real tax on marriage. In my writ-
ten testimony, I show how the marriage penalty can amount to 15 
or even 25 percent of a family’s income. 
It is no mystery why working class Americans are getting mar-
ried less. To be clear, the problem here is not government benefits 
per se, but their eligibility rules that discourage working class peo-
ple from marrying. And the result is neighborhoods with scattered 
families, inconsistent fathers, overworked mothers, and diminished 
opportunity for children. And, additionally, fewer kids overall. 
So there is a very real way to make family life more achievable: 
Fix the massive government bias against marriage, and especially 
working class marriage. 
The  second  response  to  the  marriage-first  explanation  for  de-
creased family achievement is to reconsider our justifications for 
policies like the Child Tax Credit. The justification for the Child 
Tax Credit is not that parents are inherently cash-strapped, but 
rather that parenting is inherently valuable to society. In other 
words, we should have a parenting wage, because parenting is im-
portant work, and workers deserve to be paid. 
How  we  provide  such  a  wage  may  vary,  but  we  as  a  society 
should treat parents more generously than we presently do, and in 
a way that explicitly communicates to parents that we see par-
enting as worthy labor. 
When  societies  provide  a  parenting  wage,  the  fertility  gap 
shrinks. Now if there’s not also a change in marriage norms and 
behavior, fertility rates won’t rise by a lot. So the best strategy is 
a one-two punch. For family achievability to improve in America, 
it is vital that we (1) end penalties for working class marriage, 
while  (2)  increasing  our  social  commitment  to  the  work  of  par-
enting by providing a parenting wage. And whatever happens to 
fertility rates? 
The children who are born are born into a society of greater op-
portunity, healthier families which engages in a valuable public 
catechesis. Parenting matters. 
Thank you.

STATEMENT OF MR. RYAN BOURNE, R. EVAN SCHARF CHAIR 
FOR THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF ECONOMICS, Cato IN-
STITUTE, WASHINGTON, DC 
Mr. Bourne. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, thank 
you for inviting me to testify today. 
Ensuring  that  a  family  can  be  raised  affordably  in  America 
should be an uncontroversial public policy objective. Yet govern-
ment policies at the Federal, State, and local levels today raise 
prices of basic goods and services to the disproportionate financial 
detriment of poor households and families with children. 
Households across the income spectrum spend large amounts on 
goods and services, but at their most basic should be considered ne-
cessities—items such as food, shelter, transport, clothing, utilities, 
and often child care. The average household in the poorest 20 per-

8 
cent by income allocates 57 percent of its spending toward shelter, 
food, transport, and clothing alone. 
The average married family with young children allocates 53 per-
cent. Any meaningful analysis of family affordability must there-
fore consider the determinants of prices in these and other impor-
tant product markets. 
In recent years, housing and child care affordability have become 
particularly pertinent political issues, given their high toll on fam-
ily budgets. High housing and child care prices are often deemed 
market failures, necessitating corrective government intervention, 
price controls, or subsidies. 
But in both those markets, existing government regulations ac-
tively constrain supply, in turn raising prices. Extensive academic 
work has shown how overly restrictive local land use planning and 
zoning laws constrain new housing building, particularly in major 
cities. 
As demand for housing rises, an unresponsive supply of homes 
drives up the market price of housing services, forcing down-sizing, 
longer commutes, or higher rents and mortgage payments on poor-
er families. 
Lesser known is the State-level child care staffing regulations, 
notably  restrictive  staff-to-child  ratios,  and  qualification  require-
ments for workers which reduce the supply of child care centers in 
poorer areas, driving up prices and reducing formal care options for 
families. 
Again and again one finds the same pattern of government poli-
cies increasing prices. The Federal sugar programs, milk marketing 
orders, and ethanol mandates raise the price of families’ groceries. 
Federal fuel standard regulations and State-level automobile deal-
ership laws inflate the cost of driving. Protectionist tariffs raise re-
tail clothing and footwear prices, and State occupational licensing 
laws create barriers to entry for workers, raising the prices of serv-
ices from hair braiding to dentistry. 
My research has sought to aggregate the price effects of all of 
those policies stated. Using very cautious assumptions, I find that 
combined they raise prices faced by typical poor families by any-
where between $830 and $3,500 per year directly. That is between 
7 and 30 percent of average after-tax income for households in the 
bottom quintile. Nor is that list comprehensive of the regulatory 
areas where government action raises prices. And it also does not 
consider the potentially huge indirect costs. 
We know, for example, that elevated housing, child care, and 
transport costs make it more physically and financially difficult for 
families to access jobs with higher wages. 
Undoing the worst of these price-inflating regressive regulations 
could therefore benefit poor families considerably. For example, es-
timates suggest that relaxing the average mandated staff-to-child 
ratio by just one child across all age groups could reduce child care 
prices by ten percent or more. 
Addressing government policies that drive high prices at source 
would  also  dampen  the  demands  we  see  for  risky  rent  control 
measures, affordable housing mandates, higher minimum wages, 
government subsidized child care, and new tax credits, or expanded 
allowances.

My main message  today  is therefore simple: Before proposing 
new or expanded Federal programs, we should acknowledge that 
important pro-market reform levers already exist to improve family 
affordability, particularly at the State and local levels of govern-
ment. 
These regulatory changes, especially in housing and child care, 
would not require yet more Federal borrowing, nor do they come 
with the risks associated with wage and price controls. Such an 
agenda may not be the full or final answer to the challenge you are 
considering, but again before reaching for new programs or regula-
tions we should at least attempt to undo the harm caused by exist-
ing interventions.

sions for the Record on page 65.]

Senator Heinrich [presiding].  Okay, so  having  come  in  late,

Rowe-Finkbeiner, you’re next? Okay, go right ahead. 
STATEMENT OF DR. JANE WALDFOGEL, COMPTON FOUNDA-
TION CENTENNIAL PROFESSOR FOR THE PREVENTION OF 
CHILDREN’S  AND  YOUTH  PROBLEMS,  COLUMBIA  UNIVER-
SITY SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK, NEW YORK, NY 
Dr. Waldfogel. Thank you. And thank you for inviting me to 
speak with you today. I have spent the past 25 years studying poli-
cies to support families and promote child well being, especially for 
the eleven-and-a-half million children in poverty, and the 27 mil-
lion just above the poverty line. 
Much of my recent work uses the Census Bureau’s new Supple-
mental Poverty Measure which allows us for the first time to gauge 
the anti-poverty effects of the full range of policies that Congress 
has enacted. That work makes it clear that two sets of policies are 
critically important: Refundable tax credit—EITC, and the Child 
Tax Credit—move 4.5 million children out of poverty. SNAP and 
other food and nutrition programs move 2.4 million children out of 
poverty. 
We  also  have  good  evidence  that  these  policies  reduce  family 
stress and improve child health and development. But income pov-
erty is not the only challenge that families face. 
Since 2012, with the support of the Robin Hood Foundation, our 
group at Columbia has been surveying New York City residents. 
We find that poverty is just the tip of the iceberg. While 1.6 million 
New Yorkers are poor, 4.4 million face poverty or material hard-
ship or serious health challenges. So it is not just families below 
the poverty line who struggle to put food on the table, pay their 
bills, or cope with ill health. 
So what can we do to better support American families? We need 
to start by recognizing that the majority no longer have a stay-at- 
home caregiver. But our public policies have not kept pace with 
this reality. The Family and Medical Leave Act still provides only 
unpaid leave to only 60 percent of the workforce. Federal child care 
subsidies reach only 15 percent of low-income families who need 
them.

Employer policies address some of the gap, but mostly for more 
advantaged employees. While 40 percent have access to some paid 
family leave, those who are low income, part-time, or Hispanic, are 
much less likely to be covered. Only a tiny share, about 10 percent, 
receive any help from employers to pay for child care. But we know 
from a large body of research that these policies matter. 
When employees have access to paid family leave, they are much 
more likely to be employed. They have higher earnings. Mothers 
are less likely to be depressed. They breastfeed for longer. Fathers 
are more likely to be engaged in caring for children. Infant mor-
tality and hospitalizations fall. 
Opinion  surveys  consistently  show  that  Americans  favor  paid 
family and medical leave. These policies are also endorsed by em-
ployers. My colleagues and I have been serving employers in states 
with these laws, including small employers who are often missing 
from such surveys. 
In three states with paid-leave laws, Rhode Island, New Jersey, 
and New York, we found that two-thirds of employers were sup-
portive of them. The evidence on child care is also extensive and 
clear. High-quality child care improves children’s health, their cog-
nitive  development,  their  social  development—especially  for  dis-
advantaged children. Yet too few Americans can afford it, espe-
cially in early childhood. 
When more subsidies are available, parents are more likely to be 
employed, reducing poverty and promoting family stability. Our es-
timates suggest that universal child care could reduce poverty by 
a third among families paying for child care. 
But we also need to look at what government can do to help fam-
ilies where a parent is not working, or not able to work enough 
hours. Public programs like SNAP and private programs like Food 
Pantries play a crucial role, but families also need cash to buy their 
children clothing and school supplies, pay rent and utilities. 
For this reason, virtually all of our peer countries have some 
form of universal child allowance or child benefit, paid monthly, or 
more frequently, to all families with children. 
Our Child Tax Credit is the closest policy we have to this, but 
unfortunately it leaves out the lowest income for whom it would 
have the biggest impact. Indeed, 23 million American children, 1 
in 3, live in families who earn too little to receive the full Child 
Tax Credit of $2,000 per child that was authorized under the re-
cent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This includes over half of Black and 
Hispanic children, and close to half of young children and rural 
children. 
So in summary, while there is ample evidence about the critical 
role of safety-net policies like the EITC, the Child Tax Credit, and 
SNAP, as well as the efforts of groups like Robin Hood, it is also 
clear that we need to do more. It is high time we joined our peers 
in providing paid family and medical leave, quality affordable child 
care, and a universal child allowance.

STATEMENT OF MS. KRISTIN ROWE-FINKBEINER, CEO/EXECU-
TIVE  DIRECTOR  AND  CO–FOUNDER,  MOMSRISING, 
KIRKLAND, WA 
Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner. Thank you. Chairman Lee, Vice Chair-
woman Maloney, and Members of the Joint Economic Committee. 
I  am  Kristin  Rowe-Finkbeiner,  Executive  Director  of 
MomsRising, an organization with over a million members, includ-
ing members in every State, working to increase family economic 
security. 
We are on the front lines of this crisis in America. Experts agree, 
it is getting more and more expensive to raise a family, and that 
has dire consequences. Our country, our workforce, and our econ-
omy have changed, but our policies are woefully out of date, and 
families are suffering as a result. And, good news, this crisis is 
solvable. And the policies MomsRising supports will boost families 
and our economy alike. 
The work we do lifts dads, grandparents, people with all types 
of  families,  and  of  course  moms.  The  situation  is  urgent.  At 
MomsRising we hear from people experiencing this crisis each day. 
Stories like this one: 
Jamie and her husband juggled three part-time jobs between the 
two of them, and even then could not afford child care. Jamie could 
only work when her husband was home with their toddler. And 
until they started getting SNAP, their four-year-old and Jamie her-
self often had to go without healthy food. 
Nobody, let alone anyone holding multiple jobs, should struggle 
to put food on the table. But too many families face stark choices 
like Jamie’s. A full one-in-six children in our country now live in 
food insecure households. 
You see, Jamie is not alone. One-in-three households are now 
paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing, and more 
than half are renters. College tuition has tripled since the 1980s, 
and student debt now exceeds a trillion dollars. 
Child care now costs more than public college in most states, and 
Black and Latinx families often end up having to spend more of 
their income on child care than anyone else. Meredith, from Flor-
ida, and her husband planned for years but still ended up with stu-
dent loans, health care, child care, and housing costs that made it 
hard to stay afloat. Their student loans cost as much as a car pay-
ment. They paid $1,000 per month for child care. They live with 
her parents to try to save money. 
The terrible truth is that as costs and net productivity have been 
rising,  wages  have  been  largely  stuck  for  decades.  This  means 
wealth inequality is increasing. The racial wealth gap is persisting. 
And most people raising children in America are facing a financial 
crunch. 
On top of this, women are being pushed even further behind by 
wage, hiring, and advancement discrimination. Women of all races 
on average are paid just 80 cents on a man’s dollar, and moms of 
all  races  on  average  experience  increased  wage  discrimination, 
earning an average of just 71 cents to a dad’s dollar, with moms 
of color paid even less due to structural racism.

This is happening despite studies showing a direct correlation be-
tween  high  levels  of  women  in  corporate  leadership  and  higher 
profits. 
Families  urgently  need  women’s  wages,  as  does  our  economy. 
Women became half of the full-time labor force in the last decade, 
and three-quarters of moms are now in the labor force, more than 
half of whom are the primary breadwinners. 
Further,  in  our  consumer-fueled  economy,  women  and  moms 
make  nearly  three-quarters  of  purchasing  decisions.  So  when 
women are not paid fairly and do not have funds to spend, our en-
tire economy suffers. 
It is long past time to move our policies into the 21st century to 
match our modern labor force so families and our economy can 
thrive. We need to address these challenges from multiple angles: 
better, fairer wages; updates to our outdated policies; and we need 
to make basic necessities more affordable. And, good news, there 
is growing momentum for policy change that solves many of these 
issues. 
For  instance,  dozens  of  states  and  municipalities  are  passing 
paid family medical leave, earned sick days, and pay equity laws. 
But to really move the needle, we need change at the Federal level. 
Because when this many people are having the same problems at 
the same time, we do not have an epidemic of personal failings; we 
have a national structural issue that we can and must solve to-
gether. 
Specifically, we need to move quickly to pass the FAMILY Act so 
people can afford access to paid family medical leave. The Child 
Care for Working Families Act. The Working Families Tax Relief 
Act. The Paycheck Fairness Act. The MOMS Act. And the Maternal 
CARE Act, to address maternal mortality and the racial disparities 
that drive it. The Healthy Families Act, so people can earn paid 
sick days. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, and the National 
Domestic Workers Bill of Rights. 
We also need to raise the Federal minimum wage and, impor-
tantly, have it cover all workers; ensure everyone has access to 
health care coverage, including reproductive health care. Make col-
lege and housing affordable. End mass incarceration. And invest in 
children and families, including with SNAP, WIC, the EITC, CTC, 
TANF, Head Start, and Medicaid, all of which inject funds into our 
economy. 
The list is long, but important. These policies work for families 
and deliver significant returns for our economy. 
For instance, for every dollar invested in child care, there is a re-
turn on investment of up to $9. You cannot find returns like that 
anyplace else. When we update our outdated policies, we all win, 
each and every one of us. We can and we must make it more af-
fordable to raise a family in America, and I know together we abso-
lutely will make that happen. Thank you.

either Chairman Lee will be back to take over the gavel, or we will 
take a real short recess, depending on how long that takes. 
I want to start with you, Dr. Waldfogel. I was curious. Are you 
familiar with the two-generation approach to reducing intergenera-
tional poverty? 
Dr. Waldfogel. Yes. 
Senator Heinrich. What are your thoughts on its role in poten-
tially taking those Federal policies that already exist, taking aside 
the need for additional policies, but better coordinating those to 
support the development of families and emerging from that cycle 
of poverty? 
Dr.  Waldfogel.  I  think—well,  as  you  probably  know,  it  is  a 
model that is attracting a lot of interest. There is a very successful 
program underway in Tulsa, Oklahoma, directed by one of my col-
leagues,  Jeanne  Brooks-Gunn  and  her  colleague  Lindsay  Chase- 
Lansdale. I mean it’s a win/win. So they’re taking proven early 
childhood education programs which really help engage parents, 
and they are matching those and tying them to employment and 
training programs for the parents. And not just random, you know, 
generic employment and training, but in the health care sector or, 
you know, sectors where there is really a demand. 
We know from research that when parents are involved in edu-
cation and training, their children do better in school, and they do 
better in preschool. And, likewise, obviously parents are going to do 
better in employment, education, and training, if their children are 
in stable child care. 
I think we do not do enough of that. We do not do enough of 
thinking across programs. And it is a really promising model. 
Senator Heinrich. Oh, I appreciate your comments on that. I 
know that in New Mexico we have seen groups like United Way 
and others that have really tried to pull these pieces together and 
act as a coordinator to support the family as a whole that has had 
some very positive outcomes. And we have seen that in both liberal 
and conservative states, and very different politically different gov-
ernments to have real success with this approach. And it is cer-
tainly something I have introduced legislation on and continue to 
hope to push. 
One of the other challenges that we have in my State, and I 
think this is becoming an issue all across the country, is that in 
New Mexico more than 10 percent of children are actually being 
raised  by  grandparents.  And  historically  extended  families  have 
been an incredibly important part of our culture and represent a 
significant asset to all of our communities. 
But what should we be looking at within the Federal Govern-
ment, and states, to make sure that as we are supporting families 
we are not just thinking about mothers and fathers, especially in 
those cases where another family member is actually the direct 
child care provider to those kids? 
Dr. Waldfogel. It is a really important question. I mean the sta-
tistics that I was reciting about only 60 percent of workers having 
access to the FMLA, only 40 percent of workers having some em-
ployer-paid family leave, only 15 percent have access to Federal 
child  care  subsidies  even  though  they  are  low-income  ineligible. 
That  pertains  to  parents  who  are  entitled  to  these  programs.

Grandparents are often boxed out entirely. So there is a lottery to 
get these things in the first place, but the grandparents are not 
even in the lottery because they are categorically ruled out. 
So it is just heartbreaking as you hear these grandparents who 
have chosen to take on, or had to take on these grandchildren, and 
yet are not able to get access to the programs. So, yes, we really 
need to clean it up. 
Under the FMLA and the various State paid-family leave laws, 
there is a lot of variation in who counts as ‘‘family,’’ and there is 
a lot of debate about who counts as family. But for sure we ought 
to be including grandparents. 
Senator Heinrich. You think we should be tying those benefits 
to the child, so long as they have a legitimate caregiver. 
Dr. Waldfogel. Absolutely. Absolutely. And, you know, the same 
thing with EITC, with the Child Tax Credit. 
Senator Heinrich. Exactly right. Many of these people are lit-
erally well into their retirement years and have fixed incomes, and 
yet have all of the incredible burdens of trying to not only raise a 
child but then after that also help them through their education. 
Dr. Waldfogel. Yes. 
Senator Heinrich. Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner, I wanted to ask you 
if you could expand some on how paid family leave impacts the 
presence of fathers and other caregivers in the life of a child, and 
what impacts then come from that? 
Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner. Access to paid family medical leave is a 
win/win/win/win for families, businesses, and our economy. It is 
one of those true policies that just makes you want to clap and give 
it a standing ovation. Because we see that when families have ac-
cess to paid family leave, and that actually if dads take the paid 
family leave as well, then we see those wage gaps between women 
and men, and between moms and dads, go down. 
And when we have pay parity, specifically if women had pay par-
ity, then 50 percent of children would be brought out of poverty. 
Our GDP would be increased by 3 percent. And we would add more 
than $500 billion into our economy. 
So making sure that dads also have time with children actually 
helps moms rise. And so it is very important. When we look at 
some of the other countries, and we did note that most other coun-
tries have some form of paid family leave, except the United States 
of America, we see that many have found that having dads have 
access to paid family leave is beneficial for the whole economy be-
cause again when wage gaps narrow then women have more money 
to spend—and since women are making the majority of our con-
sumer purchasing decisions in an economy where 72 percent of our 
GDP is based on consumer purchasing decisions, we all do better 
when women do better. 
But if we have this wage gap with moms, and it is significant, 
then we all do worse overall. So some of the other countries who 
have had paid family medical leave in place for longer, actually 
often offer a bonus package. If the dad takes leave, then the family 
overall  would  get  an  additional  amount  of  paid  family  medical 
leave because they found that it boosts the economy so much.

So other things about this win/win of this policy, and again I love 
this policy, is that we see that businesses are actually helped out 
with retention, productivity, and they have lower re-training costs. 
We also see that taxpayers are helped out. In some states like 
California  where  they  have  had  paid  family  medical  leave  for 
longer than others, we can see that there is a 40 percent lower 
need for SNAP and TANF because people have that bridge moment 
of having those funds come in as child care costs more than college, 
and infant child care costs are extraordinarily high. So having that 
access to paid family leave at that crucial time when a new baby 
arrives is very important. 
But not to forget what you also brought up, which is the sand-
wich generation. We need paid family medical leave, and we need 
it for all workers. And we need grandparents to be able to take it, 
as well as parents and other family members. 
Senator Heinrich. So in comparing in places that have insti-
tuted paid family leave, medical leave, and those who have not, 
there have been consistent data trends showing an actual increase 
in economic productivity? 
Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner. Yes. And actually, Dr. Waldfogel did the 
original research, which I found many years ago when I first found 
out about the mom wage gap, which is huge—moms are making 71 
cents to a dad’s dollar, and moms of color, due to structural racism, 
are experiencing increased wage hits, with Latinx moms making as 
low as 46 cents to every dollar paid to white non-Hispanic fathers. 
Senator Heinrich. With effectively the same resume, right? 
Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner. With the same resume. And we can talk 
about those studies, because I love those studies of two resumes 
where the only difference is that one is a mom and the other is a 
non-mom. This was a study done by Dr. Shelley Correll, and she 
found that you are 80 percent less likely to be hired if you are a 
mom and you are offered $11,000 lower starting salary, whereas 
dads get a wage boost. 
So getting rid of this wage hit when we have so many moms 
being the primary breadwinner is so important to our families and 
our economy. 
Senator Heinrich. And does that wage gap persist even after 
mothers return to work? 
Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner. Yes. The wage gap persists forever. And 
so there are policies like the Paycheck Fairness Act, which we also 
need to pass, and what that does, one of the important things that 
that does, is you cannot use prior salary history to create current 
salary levels, so the compounded wage hits that you have experi-
enced over time do not determine your future salary history. 
But one of the things that Dr. Waldfogel found—and I do want 
to bring this to her, because she is brilliant at this, as many other 
things, is that there is no single silver bullet solution. We need 
paid  family  medical  leave.  We  need  affordable,  accessible  child 
care. And we need sick days. And we need access to affordable 
health care. 
So families are crunched. We have a modern workforce, and our 
public policies are stuck in a time that maybe never existed. And 
so we need to bring up our workplace protections, raise our floor

for workplace protections, and then we will see those wage gaps 
narrow. And then we all win. 
Senator Heinrich. You might say there is no silver bullet, but 
there may be silver buckshot. 
Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner. Exactly. Exactly. And we can do it. In 
the past in the United States of America we have passed packages 
for many things that have many different solutions together. We 
can pass packages and independently pass these laws to make the 
changes that we need. It is long overdue. 
Senator Heinrich. I want to thank you all for your testimony. 
We are going to take a really quick recess here for about 10 min-
utes while the Chairman returns, so I can go vote as well. Thank 
you. 
[Whereupon, at 3:17 p.m., a brief recess is taken.] 
[The session resumes at 3:19 p.m., this same day.] 
Chairman  Lee  [presiding].  We  are  now  going  to  reconvene. 
Thank you for your patience, as both the Senate and the House are 
in the middle of votes, and I am grateful to my colleagues from 
both Houses and both sides of the aisle in sharing the gavel as we 
pivot back and forth to cast votes. 
We will now begin five-minute rounds of questions, or in my case 
it may be longer than that, depending on how long it takes my col-
leagues to get back, which is kind of the upside of this sort of thing 
happening. It can result in a time period windfall for those of us 
privileged enough to be here. 
Mr. Stone, let’s start with you. At the end of your testimony you 
say that our laws should communicate to the citizens that we as 
a society, as a country, quote, ‘‘see parenting as worthy, dignified, 
and important work,’’ closed quote. 
In your opinion, would our laws do a better job of communicating 
that message if we allowed parents to draw forward Social Security 
benefits immediately following the birth of a child so that mothers 
and fathers alike could access their own savings at such a pivotal 
moment? 
Mr. Stone. Absolutely. I share the view expressed by several 
people on this panel that having our lack of any solution for leave 
time is a serious issue. And having the option to do it in an actu-
arially sound way that is not inhibiting a mother’s odds of being 
hired, for example, because when you foist the bill onto a company, 
the observed effect is diminished hiring of mothers, which is not 
the outcome that any of us want. 
If you pay for it out of public coffers, then you have difficulty 
with  passing  the  bill,  frankly,  due  to  essentially  where  is  the 
money going to come from? So doing it in a way that is long run 
budget neutral is quite reasonable, I think, and is definitely a great 
improvement over what we have now in terms of communicating 
to parents and to potential parents that society is with them on 
this. That you are not doing this work alone. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you. That is somewhat of a conclusion 
that I have reached. I have done a lot of work with Senator Joni 
Ernst from Iowa, and with Ivanka Trump at the White House, in 
trying to move that idea forward. The idea here is that this is 
money that the parents themselves already are entitled to. The

question is what does the government do with that money between 
the time that it is earned and the time that they happen to retire. 
It is my belief, and that of the individuals I have mentioned, that 
parents ought to have the option of deciding to tap into some of 
that at the time they have a child. 
In your testimony you speak about the marriage penalties for 
low-income families in our Tax Code, and in means-tested welfare 
programs funded by the Federal Government. You conclude that in 
effect the Federal Government has put its thumb on the scales 
against working-class marriage. 
What are some of the most important policy fixes that you can 
think of that would help remove the anti-marriage bias in our Tax 
Code in our Federal welfare system? 
Mr. Stone. So in the example families that I provide in my writ-
ten testimony, most of the penalty that they experience comes from 
the Earned Income Tax Credit, as well as to some extent from 
SNAP and from housing vouchers, or housing benefits generally. 
The Earned Income Tax Credit is actually procedurally a simple 
fix, right? Just double the eligibility thresholds if you get married. 
The problem is that this costs somewhere between $100 and $250 
billion per year, which is—yeah, those are large numbers, right? 
Chairman Lee. You  are  not going  to  fund  that out  of those 
cushions—— 
Mr. Stone. Nope, you are not. So to do this, there is not just the 
simple fix one thing, right? You would have to step in and say, 
well, okay, we cannot afford the current level of generosity for sin-
gle parents if we extend it in the same way for married parents. 
So you would need to do a wider, a wider fix. 
Now a simpler thing would be to simply, instead of having the 
Earned Income Tax Credit be sort of a backdoor family support 
program, just replace it with a simpler wage subsidy. And then 
also route more money through either the Child Tax Credit or some 
other child-specific focused benefit. 
It is not clear why we would say because you have children the 
government will be even more determined to support your work 
outside the home. We of course want to support people with chil-
dren,  but  I  do  not  think  our  desire  to  support  children  is  nec-
essarily contingent on them, in the case of the EITC, being unmar-
ried and working outside the home. 
There is no clear rationale for this structure. So EITC is a big 
one, but you see similar problems in every means-tested program. 
So  you  will  have  a  similar  issue  with—really,  you  cannot  just 
change  one  or  two  thresholds.  You  have  to,  statutorily  in  most 
cases, rewrite the whole program. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that 
Congress passed in 2017 includes a doubling of the Child Tax Cred-
it, and an expansion of its refundability to cover the payroll tax li-
ability and counteract the parent tax penalty. 
In your written testimony, you wrote that a model family, Liam 
and Emma, are trapped out-of-wedlock by the marriage penalties 
in our Tax Code. So this couple you describe, Liam and Emma, are 
effectively trapped out of marriage as a result of that. You note 
that the only tax provision that did not penalize them is in fact the 
Child Tax Credit.

So how could this family have fared without the Child Tax Credit 
expansion? And why is it important for the rest of our Tax Code 
to treat Liam and Emma with similar fairness? 
Mr. Stone. So in this case, what happened was that when, in 
this case Emma, is the one who I have as the custodial parent be-
fore marriage, and she in claiming two child—— 
Chairman  Lee.  I  mispronounced  that  name?  I  thought  that 
was—— 
Mr. Stone. It was Liam and Emma. I just picked the most com-
mon male and female birth names of 2018 and assigned them. But 
so she is the custodial parent for these two children, but her in-
come, which is a modest income, I think it is like $16,000 is what 
I put in, but it is not enough for her to actually get the full re-
fund—the full nonrefundable portion of the Child Tax Credit. 
Now once they get married, once Liam and Emma marry, their 
combined income is enough. And also, because they get married 
and their EITC is smaller, they can sort of score more refundable 
on the other side because those two offset to some extent. You can-
not—depending  on  your  income,  you  cannot  always  get  the 
refundability of both—or the nonrefundable section is offset. 
So in this case, actually the Child Tax Credit expanded in gen-
erosity when they got married because of how the nonrefundable 
portion interacts with the refundability of the Earned Income Tax 
Credit. So it is sort of some thorny math. 
But this family, they lost money on the EITC, was their big loss, 
right? That Emma was getting $5,000 before. But when they get 
married, I believe they drop to none, or virtually no EITC benefit. 
And at the same time, they lose some means-tested benefits on the 
other side, which is to say that the Tax Code is saying even though 
you two perhaps love each other, even though you two have jobs, 
they are not making large amounts of money but a couple making 
$36, $37, $38,000, there is no reason they should not be able to 
have the American Dream. 
Maybe they would like to be raising these children together and 
would like to be married, but the Tax Code says, sorry. If you get 
married, you are going to lose $10,000. 
Chairman Lee. We should not be punishing them for that. 
Mr. Stone. Right. We are punishing responsible decisions that 
I think everyone in the room thinks these people, they want this. 
It is not the State’s job to get between them in raising their chil-
dren together. 
Chairman Lee. Right. Thank you. 
Senator Cassidy. 
Senator Cassidy. Chairman Lee, thank you for putting this on. 
This past spring, Senator Sinema and I announced a bi-partisan 
solution—thank you for nodding your head ‘‘yes.’’ You are familiar 
with it—to help working families. And I would say it is currently 
the only common ground paid leave plan in the Senate. 
I am happy to report additional Republican and Democrat Sen-
ators are now supporting and working with us on legislative text 
we hope to introduce this fall. 
To give background, for many dual-income families, the first year 
following the birth or adoption is the most expensive. In subse-

Tax Cut and Jobs Act that was just being discussed increased the 
Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000. So under our proposal, the 
family who has the newborn child gets $5,000. And they pull for-
ward that benefit from subsequent years. So instead of $2,000 in 
year two of life, they would get $1,500. And on down until it is paid 
back. 
We like it. It does not raise taxes. Payroll taxes inherently are 
regressive. And so we avoid that. And it has no mandates upon the 
employer or the employee, and it does not increase the Federal def-
icit—de minimis, if it does at all. In fact, I think we heard from— 
one of you is from AEI. One thing that we learned when we did 
a symposium there is it may actually be beneficial to the govern-
ment fisk, at least one theory which seems plausible. Because when 
the mother remains attached to the workplace, instead of going on 
public  assistance,  which  has  implications  for  the  child  and  the 
mother long term, she remains attached and the accumulation of 
seniority  and  training  allows  her  wage  base  to  grow  from  that 
point, as opposed to be brought back and then begin to grow. 
So we think it has downstream benefits for mother and child. 
And by the way, it also extends to parents, to a father, but obvi-
ously it is the mother who breastfeeds, for example, so we antici-
pate that women will use it more often, which is why I use the 
feminine. 
So, Dr. Waldfogel, if I pronounced it correctly, you are nodding 
your head affirmatively, so I would just ask your opinion on that 
and any suggestions you would have to maker it better. 
Dr. Waldfogel. I have to say I am just so heartened to hear a 
discussion of two different proposals for paid family leave, so I just 
think it is fabulous that this is on the agenda in a really serious 
way and that we are having the conversation we are having about 
how to fund it. Because that really is the issue now. 
So this is a sea change from where we have been on paid family 
and medical leave. Where it used to be what is this thing, and 
should we do it? It is so heartening that we are now in a place 
where we are all in agreement that new parents ought to have 
some period of paid leave. And we are trying to figure out how to 
pay for it. So I just think this is incredibly heartening. 
So  we  have  heard  about  a  proposal  where  people  could  draw 
down from their Social Security, or people could draw forward their 
Child Tax Credit. I mean I have to say I have concerns about both 
those proposals, because as much as I would like to support new 
parents, and I think I have written about that more than anybody 
else over the last 25 years, so I absolutely get the importance of 
paid family and medical leave, but I really worry about what hap-
pens in the out-years when those benefits have been drawn down. 
Families with 2- and 3-year-olds also need the Child Tax Credit, 
as we have been discussing today. It is a huge anti-poverty pro-
gram, and I would hate to be robbing families later in childhood. 
Likewise, we used to have a big problem with elderly poverty in 
this country. We still have not completely tackled it. Social Secu-
rity is the biggest anti-poverty program we have. And so I worry 
about  families  drawing  down  their  Social  Security  because  they 
want to do the best for their children——

Senator Cassidy. Well just because—he had his turn, and I am 
going to keep on mine, so—— 
Dr. Waldfogel. I have been studying, there are now eight states 
that  have  passed  these  payroll-funded  paid  family  and  medical 
leave laws. They are working really well. It is pennies per week to 
fund them. We have been talking to employers, including small em-
ployers. Every State we have talked to employers, two-thirds of 
them are supportive or very supportive of these laws. Another 10 
or 15 percent, or 20 percent, are neutral. That means that just a 
tiny share of employers are opposed. 
The public is passing these things. I mean, legislators are—— 
Senator Cassidy. Let me pause you for a second. I have limited 
time, so let me pause. I will also say, though, that if you are going 
to do it through a payroll tax, that will be regressive. And it is easy 
to speak of that which is de minimis for someone who is more afflu-
ent, but for a working family that so-called de minimis amount is 
actually significant. 
I will also say, and I think research shows, the more financial 
burden you put on an employer to employ somebody, the more like-
ly they will figure out how to become more productive and lay folks 
off. So I think that there is a little bit of a false narrative that 
there is no cost on raising payroll taxes for a more generous ben-
efit. 
But whereas we just raised the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to 
$2,000, and now we are going to concentrate a portion at the fam-
ily’s option on the year of the child’s birth. But they will still re-
ceive more than they have been receiving, seems to be something 
which, yes, they receive less at their option, and it’s more than 
they’ve been receiving of late. 
Mr. Stone, you’ve spoken I think of how pro-natal policies do not 
necessarily increase with more natal, if you will, increased fertility, 
suggesting, as I gather, that a financial decision of is a child too 
expensive, they choose not to have another child. But if you have, 
whatever form it takes, a child tax credit, would that be a pro-natal 
policy? 
Mr. Stone. So the research on pro-natal policymaking is that 
when countries spend money trying to get slightly higher fertility 
rate, that they do get a little bit of a bump, but it does cost a lot 
of money to get that increase. 
However, the most cost-effective means of bringing about some 
increase in the desired birth rate, the number of births women 
have and that they intend to have, is through front-loaded benefits. 
That essentially giving people $10,000 up front does sort of get 
you—has a larger influence on child-bearing decisions than $1,000 
a year for 10 years. 
So this is more likely to have an impact on child-bearing deci-
sions. Now there is a question: If you are paying that up front by 
taking it from later down the road, I am actually also sympathetic 
to the concern raised before that that family may need that money 
down the road. So you may front-load their decision here, and then 
they really need the money later. 
Senator Cassidy. Earlier you spoke nicely, or one of you spoke 
nicely of the interaction, but we do know that typically people have

Mr. Stone.  Well  because  income  tends  to  rise  over  their  age 
cycle. 
Senator Cassidy. Right. Particularly, again, as I spoke earlier, 
if you are able to maintain your attachment to the workforce with 
your training, et cetera. And so I think the, if you will, the kind 
of interaction that we anticipate is, yes, you are pulling forward if 
you wish, but because you maintain that attachment your salary 
continues to rise. And there is a little bit of a backfill that occurs 
from that. 
Also, acknowledging that first year of life is the more expensive 
year of life. I will take one more, since the Chairman just took a 
powder—and we also would point out, by the way, that we think 
CBO will not score ours as being very expensive because the money 
is already out there. 
And so what they may do in Sweden would be expensive for us. 
It will be the occasional child who dies before age 10, at which 
point the money is forgiven, but it will not be something more than 
that. 
I will thank you all for your time, and yield back to the Chair-
man. 
Chairman Lee. We are going to turn now to Mr. Heck. I am 
going to go cast the final vote and I will be right back. 
Mr. Heck. 
Representative Heck. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My apologies 
on behalf of the House Members who have been over voting on leg-
islation. So I am helicoptering in here without the benefit of con-
text of what you all presented. I did have an opportunity to quickly 
peruse your testimony. 
I thank you all very much for being here. 
Mr. Stone, I guess I would like to start with you. I am certain 
that  you  have  probably  already  talked  about  this,  but  unfortu-
nately, again, I was not here. I am fascinated by your research 
finding a relationship between fertility rates and home ownership. 
By  tolerating  impediments  to  home  ownership  and  decreased 
home ownership as we have in recent years, do we de facto have 
an implicit policy of lowering our fertility rate? Is that what you 
are suggesting, sir? 
Mr. Stone. So I don’t know that it is specifically about home 
ownership. I think it is more about housing costs. So there are 
many ways to manage housing costs. It could be by buying an af-
fordable home, or it could be by renting in a neighborhood that is 
very affordable. 
My concern is that housing costs are the one place where the 
amount that families spend on children is in fact being outpaced 
by price, where there is real, solid evidence of considerable finan-
cial stress on families in the housing sector. And that is driven— 
there is a lot of research on this—it is essentially driven by espe-
cially local policy. Choices about land use. Choices about where 
people can build, the codes that they build under, these sorts of 
things. 
My concern—I did not focus on that in my spoken testimony be-
cause this is largely a State and local choice. The extent to which

anyone in Washington can fix this is, with all due respect to the 
building that we are in, somewhat limited. 
So it is a serious problem. There is an enormous amount of re-
search suggesting that land use regulations and positive shocks to 
the price of housing, especially in the rental market, but in the 
home-owned market as well, have a negative impact on people’s 
ability to achieve their family desires. This is a real concern. It is 
policy driven. But it is local policy. It is 50,000 municipalities that 
you need to convince to stop zoning against families. 
Representative Heck. So the correlation, the inverse correla-
tion, is between price, irrespective of whether there is an equity po-
sition or not, and fertility? 
Mr. Stone. Yes. 
Representative Heck. So I have had the privilege the last two- 
and-a-half  years  to  chair  the  New  Democrat  Coalition  Housing 
Task Force, and we have come away with a couple of research- 
based findings that I think are relevant to this conversation. 
The first of which is that in the last 15 years the single largest 
increase  in  household  budget  has  been  for  housing,  more  than 
health care, more than higher education. It is masked by the fact 
that those of us who have been in a place for a long period—a good 
portion of that 15 years, or been a long 15 years, have not experi-
enced this. But of all major household expenditures, the cost of rent 
or, conversely, the cost to pay your mortgage, has gone up faster 
than anything else that they are confronting, number one. 
And number two, that this problem is materially contributed to 
by a lack of supply of housing stock, which of course compels people 
to stay renting, which drives up occupancy rates, which then drives 
up  rents,  which  cause  more  people  to  be  rent-burdened,  causes 
more people to require public subsidy. And in fact causes more peo-
ple to be homeless. 
But I do not think either of those observations captures the in-
sidious effect on the home ownership side of the deferred home ac-
quisition by millennials. And we have measured this. It is pretty 
clear that the 28-year-old is more likely to be living upstairs at 
mom and dad’s house than ever before. 
And why I never miss an opportunity to point this out is: In an 
era  when  defined  benefit  pension  plans  are  falling  through  the 
basement, people’s retirement security has been diminished. And 
the number one—the number one—asset that the average Amer-
ican  invest  in  contributing  to  their  retirement  security  is  their 
home. 
Care to respond to my diatribe? 
Mr. Stone. Yeah. So there is a lot there. So the number one 
asset that many families are invested in is their home. The funny 
thing about owning a home, see, if you own a share of a company, 
then maybe you get dividends, or maybe you just get a report regu-
larly and you’re going to sell it later. The funny thing about owning 
a home is that your dividends come in the form of not getting 
rained on. And then you actually have to put a lot of extra money 
in it. 
It is this company that you own a part of, but you have to buy 
a new roof for the company every so often. And then you have to 
buy a new hot water company—or you have to buy a new hot water

heater for that company. And you have to keep buying all this stuff 
for what is allegedly an investment. 
Now the problem is that when you view the home as an invest-
ment vehicle rather than essentially a form of durable consumption 
which depreciates, it creates an incentive to lock other people out. 
Essentially it says, well, my home is an investment, so I am going 
to make sure that my school district remains the type of people 
that people who will buy my home want their kids to go to school 
with. My home is an investment, so I am going to make sure that 
not too many other homes get built so that if somebody wants to 
live here they have to buy my home. 
So I understand that many Americans have bought into the story 
that the roof over their head is also their retirement, but I would 
suggest that, first of all, this has not always historically been the 
case. Typically your security in retirement was that you had chil-
dren who would take care of you. 
And  secondly,  that  this  investment,  this  idea  that  the  home 
needs to appreciate forever, it creates a toxic politic of exclusion at 
the neighborhood level. That ultimately the only path forward is 
for a very large number of neighborhoods in America to realize that 
they are going to increase in quantity of houses, not in price of 
houses. 
So home ownership may be very important for the benefits it pro-
vides to a family in terms of security, but I think Americans ex-
pecting that real estate, particularly personally held real estate, 
will be their retirement security are going to be in for a nasty 
shock. 
Representative Heck. Are you suggesting that they are mutu-
ally exclusive? 
Mr. Stone. There are times and places where real estate will ap-
preciate and it will not have a negative impact on anyone else and 
it is not a result of exclusion, but there is an abundant amount of 
research at this point that suggests that most of the really hot real 
estate markets in America are that way not just because people de-
cided that neighborhood was amazing, but because a new supply is 
being kept off the market generally by local regulatory choices. 
Representative Heck. But in a market where demand signifi-
cantly exceeds supply—— 
Mr. Stone. Create new supply. 
Representative Heck. It would be hard for me to exaggerate 
how strongly I agree with you, Mr. Stone. It is a supply issue, prin-
cipally. It’s not a demand issue. We are over 7 million housing 
units short in this country, and it creates all sorts of problems to 
families, many of which have been set forth here. 
Mr. LaHood. 
Representative LaHood. Well I want to thank the panelists for 
being here today, for your testimony, and having this conversation, 
and thank the Committee for having this hearing today. 
Maybe a question to all of the witnesses here. Arguably we live 
in one of the most prosperous times in our modern history in terms 
of economically and where we are at, looking at all the measure-
ments. And yet many people claim that having children is too ex-
pensive. Can any of you talk a little bit about what is going on

there, and maybe some of the reasons for that? Or if there is some 
validity to that? 
Yes, Mr. Bourne. 
Mr. Bourne. Well I think we have to split this issue into think-
ing about how people exist with the costs that they face today, and 
changed expectations over time. 
I agree with much of what Mr. Stone said earlier, in that if you 
look at the broad trends of costs of everyday basic goods and neces-
sities over time, and bundle up that basket of goods, actually the 
affordability of raising a family on fixed expectations about what 
you want to get, or what you want to provide for your children, in 
most areas and for most families has not gone up. 
But over time, people’s expectations rise about what they want 
to  deliver  for  their  children.  You  want  to  invest  in  after-school 
clubs and activities. You want to provide them with the best qual-
ity child care available for you. So the amount that is actually 
spent by many families on children has risen. 
That is not to say that policy does not play a role in raising 
prices from what prices could be in a more market-friendly econ-
omy. And much of my research has been attempting to show that 
in key markets that occupy large segments of families’ budgets, 
particularly child care and housing costs, there are big regulatory 
barriers which restrict supply of new goods such that when de-
mand rises for child care, or demand rises for housing, there is not 
an adequate supply response. 
That manifests itself, as Mr. Stone said, in the housing market 
mainly through local zoning and land use planning laws which are 
particularly pernicious in many growing metropolitan areas. But in 
child care it also manifests itself through staffing regulations and 
occupational licensing, which many parents in upper income quar-
tiles desire that type of improved quality from child care, more 
interaction between staff and children, and better qualified staff. 
But when that imposes a policy across the State level, that has the 
effect of raising child care prices and forcing many poorer families 
out of the formal child care sector and into the informal child care 
sector where we have less idea of what quality is. 
So I guess to summarize that point, I agree with Mr. Stone that 
over the long term if you wanted exactly the same expectations for 
your kids as 30 years ago, things have probably got more afford-
able. Our expectations change, and that means that over time peo-
ple are spending more money on their families. And there are cer-
tain policies, particularly at the State and local level, which raise 
prices in those sectors. 
Representative  LaHood.  And  is  there  a  suggested  policy 
change to help remedy that? 
Mr. Bourne. Well the main point that I made in my testimony, 
the two big-ticket items, are housing and child care for many fami-
lies  with  young  children.  And  most  of  the  positive  regulatory 
changes that could be made would primarily have to occur at the 
State and local level. 
Now Federal Government policy can push in the right direction. 
I may not agree with all of the current Federal subsidy programs 
and their existence, but to the extent that we are going to have 
them, greater conditionality, making sure that we are not reward-

ing bad policy by distributing subsidies to areas that have very re-
stricted supply sides in child care and housing I think is something 
that Congressmen and women should be looking at. 
Representative LaHood. Thank you. 
Mr. Stone, do you have any comment on that? 
Mr. Stone. I agree. 
Representative LaHood. Okay. Doctor, I know you only have 
30 seconds here, but do you want to comment? 
Dr. Waldfogel. Yeah, just I would, you know, from the historical 
perspective I think we have to just remember the sea change that 
we have seen in American families, from the stay-at-home care-
giver, single breadwinner model, to the dual breadwinner model, or 
the single-parent model. And so now most children are growing up 
with all of their parents in the labor force. And we just have not 
come to terms with that in terms of what that means, in terms of 
the need for paid leave, and the need for support for child care. 
Child care, even if it were less regulated, is expensive and we real-
ly have not come to terms with that. 
Representative LaHood. Thank you. 
Chairman Lee. Mr. Trone. 
Representative Trone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Dr. Waldfogel, in 2016 Maryland ranked fifth in the country in 
terms of most expensive child care. It costs an average of $14,000. 
In closer to D.C., it can cost $37,000. 
The Maryland General Assembly is working to expand pre-K, but 
it is still not universal and will not be in the foreseeable future. 
Could you speak to the benefits for families’ experience from hav-
ing universal pre-K, and also the positive impact on even the high-
er income families? 
Dr. Waldfogel. We now have a lot of research about universal 
pre-K and the benefits that it offers for all children. So the benefits 
are largest for the low-income children, children with the least-edu-
cated parents, because it helps them catch up, but it is beneficial 
for all kids. And it also is a very important form of child care for 
that year before school. 
But as you are indicating, universal pre-K will only cover the 
year before children start school, or in some states they are extend-
ing it down to a second year, and it still leaves infant and toddler 
years—which are the most expensive—uncovered. 
The Federal Government has a child care subsidy program for 
low-income families, but it is only funded at a level of support that 
will cover subsidies for 15 percent of the low-income families who 
are eligible. So basically it is a lottery. If you are a low-income fam-
ily, there is a lottery. And if you are lucky, you hold the winning 
ticket, you get a child care subsidy. But if not, you are out of luck. 
And that is just unconscionable. 
Representative Trone. The number I have heard, as far as re-
turn on investments, is 4 to 1. Do you think that is reasonable? 
Dr. Waldfogel. It is at least 4 to 1. With child care, it is all 
about the quality. So the best quality programs, it is as high as 8 
or 9 to 1. The lower-quality programs, it is less than that. 
So that is why we need to be careful about, you know, proposals 
to cut the quality, and cut the regulations, because there are two 
sides to that. There is the reduced cost, but then there is also the

reduced  benefits,  or  even  the  risks  of  putting  children  in  sub-
standard child care. 
Representative Trone. Right. Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner, when we 
talk about the lack of affordable child care, I want to talk about 
the populations that are more effective than others, and also you 
do not mind speaking to—I am a co-sponsor of the Child Care for 
Working Families Act, which will create some high-quality child 
care options all year around. What are some of the proposals we 
should push forward that are those most needed? 
Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner. Thank you. Well first of all, thank you 
for being a co-sponsor of the Child Care for Working Families Act. 
It is an Act that the members of MomsRising, over a million of 
them, strongly support, as well. 
As you have heard today, we hear from our members about three 
key areas of crisis in child care. There is affordability, which we 
are hearing a lot about right now. There is accessibility, which 50 
percent of parents are living right now in a child care desert, so 
no matter how much money they had they could not find child care. 
And then there is also excellence. 
So  we  really  need,  as  Dr.  Waldfogel  said,  high-quality  early 
learning programs to make sure that every child has the oppor-
tunity to thrive. And that is where we see our strongest return on 
investment. 
Importantly,  we  need  to  make  investments  in  child  care  and 
early learning starting from zero to age five, until they get into 
kindergarten. So what we are seeing right here is incredible gaps 
in coverage. 
We need to start with access to paid family medical leave. Then 
we need to move into subsidized child care that is real subsidized 
child care, that also has a career and wage ladder for child care 
workers who are among the lowest paid workers in our Nation. 
And in fact the Child Care for Working Families Act includes com-
ponents that relate to all of those. 
And then we need to have universal pre-K. So we need to have 
a whole system that includes the education of our children. Be-
cause here is one thing that is important: Parents need safe, en-
riching places for their children to be so that they can work as par-
ents have been increasingly in the labor force. Children need safe, 
enriching places to be so they can thrive in the future and be our 
future leaders. And child care workers need fair pay. 
Just one point that people were talking about a moment ago was 
about we have had increased productivity in the United States of 
America: While productivity has gone up 70 percent in the past 30 
years, actual wages have remained quite stagnant in the last cou-
ple of decades. 
Representative Trone. Where do you see the kids, four years 
or in pre-K, where do you see the twos and threes? What combina-
tion of public-private? What does that look like? 
Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner. Oh, that is an excellent question. Right 
now we have a patchwork approach. We do not have a smooth line 
through child care. And what we need to do is we need to make 
sure policies like the Child Care for Working Families Act passed. 
We need to look at restructuring our Tax Code. And we need to ad-

vance policies that allow parents to be in the labor force and make 
fair wages, no matter where they work. 
Chairman Lee. Mr. Beyer. 
Representative Beyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank 
all of you very much for coming. I am sorry we have been in and 
out with these vote things we have to do. 
I want to push back first on Mr. Bourne on the over-regulation 
of child health care. I know it is expensive, but I am from Virginia, 
and I promise you every regulation we have there was the result 
of some tragedy. 
I have been part of this for 25 years. Whether it is the quality 
of the people that we are hiring that were not given criminal back-
ground checks, or the quality of the facility, or every time some 
child dies we end up trying to find a way to put the regulations 
in place to make it safe for all of our kids. 
I also—you know, a subset of this is pushing back against women 
in the workforce, which has caused all these problems, and yet one 
of the things this Committee pushes so hard for is the growth in 
GDP. And I think the post-World War II economic miracle has only 
been possible because of the women in the workforce. 
In fact, this Committee in the last couple of years has pushed 
back a bunch on the fact that women are, as a relatively smaller 
percentage in the workforce than they were 10 years ago, 20 years 
ago, 30 years ago, which is one of the things that slowed down our 
economic growth. 
So, to Dr. Waldfogel, one of the great points of contention is the 
net effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Do you see that it paid 
nearly enough attention to our lower income folks, the ones that 
are not getting married because they cannot afford to? 
Dr. Waldfogel. I mean we were talking earlier about the expan-
sion of the Child Tax Credit that was contained in that bill, and 
that  certainly  was  very  important  for  low-income  families.  So  I 
think that was a huge plus in that bill. But are you speaking of 
other specific provisions? 
Representative Beyer. And thank you for pointing out again 
and again that, and the Earned Income Tax Credit. One of the 
things we are trying to push through the House right now is the 
significant increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit, especially for 
childless individuals. 
Dr. Waldfogel. Yes, it is very important. Childless individuals 
are young people who are the parents of tomorrow, that are about 
to become parents. It turns out that young adults are the poorest 
age  group  now  in  America.  Who  knew?  I  would  have  always 
thought young children are the poorest age group, but it is young 
adults 18 to 24 who are now our poorest age group. And that is 
the kind of group that could benefit from an extension of Childless 
EITC. And of course noncustodial fathers are another group. And 
we have been talking quite a bit today about the importance of fa-
ther involvement, and how we want to be sure that they are in-
volved. 
So, yeah, we want to be even-handed in our policies and be sup-
porting both moms and dads, and also supporting young people 
who are on their pathway to starting families.

Representative Beyer. Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner, Mr. Stone talked 
and wrote very well about the marriage penalty that so many of 
our Federal programs hurt you, or move in the wrong direction 
when you get married. 
From a MomsRising perspective, have you guys thought much 
about how you would overcome the various marriage penalty proc-
esses in our programs, beginning with the Tax Code? 
Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner. One thing that we hear from our mem-
bers again and again is that people should be able to determine 
who is their family, and how they are raising their children. 
We heard earlier today about grandparents who are involved also 
in families, and about the sandwich generation. And so the impor-
tant thing to do is look at the reality of families today and make 
sure  that  we  are  supporting  all  families  equitably  and  equally. 
That means in the Tax Code. That means in our public policies. 
And that means updating our outdated public policies to match our 
modern labor force and not ignore the facts that women are in the 
labor force to stay; and that companies that employ us actually 
have higher returns coming in. (So say studies like a 20-year study 
at Pepperdine University of what happens when you have more 
women in leadership.) 
And so we want to make sure that everybody has a chance to 
thrive, and we are in it for the long haul to make sure that hap-
pens. 
Representative Beyer. Very good. And, Mr. Stone, to toss that 
same question back to you on the marriage penalties, have you put 
together your comprehensive legislative piece for Senator Lee and 
for us to fix that? 
Mr. Stone. Pieces of it are actually in the works, but there is 
an interesting case where we just heard a very large marriage pen-
alty advanced, very well-intentioned. We know the EITC discrimi-
nates against childless people, right? It does. It does not give them 
as equal of a benefit. 
But in the example tax filers that I provided in my written testi-
mony, if both of those individual people were getting the full EITC 
that they would be eligible for, if a childless partner was as well, 
the marriage penalty would be even larger. It would be another 
$5,000 that would be lost when they got married. 
So if we even things out for childless people without fixing the 
basic anti-marriage position that is written into the EITC, we have 
made the problem even worse. And this is this issue where we 
make policy for people as they are today, but human lives are not 
static. They develop. The person who is single today is married to-
morrow. The childless person today has children tomorrow. People’s 
life situation changes. 
And when we do not think about that, we end up creating bar-
riers to the life that they themselves want. So I want childless peo-
ple to be treated equally, which is why I mentioned it would be bet-
ter if we just did it all through a flat wage subsidy that did not 
refer to family status at all. 
But if we are going to have this done when you file your taxes, 
I do not want it to be a situation where both the childless and the 
custodial parent get a benefit as long as they stay separate. That 
is not a recipe for supporting Americans of any family status.

Representative Beyer. Thank you very much. It sounds like 
you and Andrew Yang have been talking. 
Senator, I yield back. 
Mr. Stone. He has interesting ideas. 
Chairman Lee. Senator Hassan. 
Senator Hassan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for 
holding this hearing. Thank you to all of our witnesses for being 
here. 
I had a question to Dr. Waldfogel to follow up. I understand 
there has been considerable discussion already about paid family 
leave, but I wanted to follow up on one aspect. 
I, too, will just add my voice to the chorus that families should 
not have to make the impossible choice between earning a pay-
check and spending time with a loved one who is in need, or taking 
care of their own personal health care crisis. And it has been great 
to see eight states and Washington, D.C., enact paid family and 
medical leave to try to address this issue. 
And as I think has been discussed, we all know these programs 
provide partial wage replacement to workers who need to care for 
a newborn or a newly adopted child, provide care for a family mem-
ber in need, or address their own health care crisis. 
I know there has been discussion here today about the benefits 
of paid family leave to the family members, but could you address 
a little bit the benefits for employers? What have we learned about 
how that really, what the ripple effect is in the workplace? 
Dr. Waldfogel. Thank you for the question. It is a really impor-
tant one. We tend to stress the benefits for employees, and we do 
not talk enough about employers. 
Employers are in a tough position. They are looking for employ-
ees in a tight labor market, and so what really is valuable for them 
is having talent and retaining it. And what is costly for them is los-
ing that talent. 
So when we talk with employers—and we have been surveying 
employers in states that have these laws—what they say is, even 
the small employers, is we give people leave anyway. We have to 
give them leave. Somebody is ill herself, her husband has cancer, 
her mother falls and breaks her hip, she has a new baby, we have 
to give the employee time off work. With these laws, we are able 
to see that they get paid, and we do not have to pay them ourselves 
off of our payroll. So they are getting paid through these public so-
cial insurance funds. 
And what we have also heard from employers is that in the vast 
majority of the times, about 85 percent of the time, they are cov-
ering the work by assigning it to other employees, or waiting for 
the person to come back. So it is very rare to hire a replacement 
worker. Only about 15 percent of the time. And only about 15 per-
cent of employers say I had trouble covering the work while the 
person was out. 
So it is not surprising that we are hearing that two-thirds of our 
employers that we are speaking to—and this includes small em-
ployers—are supportive of these laws. And I have to say, when we 
started the survey I was really nervous what we were going to find, 
and it is maybe 10, 15 percent are opposed. And I suppose 10 or 
15 percent of employers would oppose pretty much any law, so the

fact that we are finding about 85 percent or 90 who are either sup-
portive or neutral I think is pretty impressive. 
Senator Hassan. Well thank you for that. And I think it is pret-
ty impressive, too. It is also similar to what I have begun hearing. 
New Hampshire is a very small business State, and it is what I 
have been hearing as well. 
The other thing I wanted to touch on with both you, Doctor, and 
Ms.  Rowe-Finkbeiner,  is  the  issue  of  businesses  needing  more 
skilled workers. Because, again, that is probably the number one 
thing I hear from businesses across New Hampshire. 
What we also hear is that too often individuals who are under- 
employed, or who have fallen out of the labor market entirely, are 
not able to get the training they need for the jobs that are open, 
but also that they face barriers such as transportation and child 
care. So either to get that training, they’re having trouble finding 
child care, or transportation to it. 
So I have introduced something called—and it is a bipartisan 
bill—called The Gateway To Careers Act, which would strengthen 
career pathway opportunities and help individuals navigate bar-
riers that keep too many people from participating or staying in 
the workforce. 
Through your work and advocacy, do you think we should be 
doing more to help families access the services they may already 
be eligible for, and strengthen career training programs to be re-
sponsive to issues that individuals face outside the workplace? 
Dr. Waldfogel. I mean I will just briefly say the work that I 
have done on how families spend their EITC suggests to me that 
families are really facing very high transportation and child care 
costs. So I think we have always thought that the EITC would be 
used for durable goods, or be used for furniture for the family, or 
maybe getting into a better apartment, addressing the housing sit-
uation. Unfortunately, families seem to be using it to pay back 
bills, or to be paying for work expenses, primarily transportation 
and child care. So, yes, anything you can do on that front I think 
would be fabulous. 
Senator Hassan. Thank you. And Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner. 
Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner. I agree. Thank you for putting forward 
that bill. We really see three things that need to happen. 
We need better, fairer wages. We need to update our outdated 
policies. And those policies need to be comprehensive. 
So when we are talking about things like paid family medical 
leave, we need it to mirror the FMLA, which is unpaid, in terms 
of not only covering new parents but also covering people’s own sig-
nificant serious illness and the significant serious illness of a close 
family member. In fact, that is the majority of the time that the 
unpaid FMLA is used. 
So we want to make sure that coverage is happening in paid 
family medical leave too. And as we update these outdated policies, 
we do not want to rob one program to pay another program. Fami-
lies are already stretched. One thing that has not come up in this 
hearing so far is wealth inequality. And I mentioned a little bit 
earlier that we have had 70 percent increase in productivity, but 
really over the last 30 years wages have remained stagnant.

That is putting us in a situation that an MIT economist has said 
is leading us toward a third world economic model, which is going 
to implode the middle class. 
So we need to make sure that we have comprehensive policies. 
And we also—to your point and to your bill—need to make basic 
necessities, including transportation, more affordable for families. 
We do not have a single one-solution for what is happening in 
the United States of America right now, but we know that America 
is in crisis. We know that families want to do what is best for their 
children—all families—and I am so thankful that you here today 
are looking at the solutions from multiple angles as well. 
Senator Hassan. Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Chairman, for 
letting us go over. 
Chairman Lee. Happy to do it. We are always happy to accom-
modate those of our Members who show up, especially during a 
busy day like this one when we have votes. So I am grateful to 
have had the participation, bipartisan participation, from both ends 
of the Capitol. 
We are going to do a second round, for any who are interested 
in it, and we still start that now. 
Mr. Bourne, I want to start this round with you. In your testi-
mony you explain that some child care regulations, some regula-
tions in place that affect the child care industry, tend to reduce the 
supply of child care centers, especially in poor areas, driving up 
prices and reducing the rate of formal care options for families. 
For example, a new law in Washington, D.C., will, when it be-
comes fully implemented over the next few years, start to require 
child care providers to  earn  degrees. In some cases, a two-year 
post-secondary degree, in some cases a four-year college degree. In 
other cases, it might be a certification. This of course will inevi-
tably have an impact on supply, which ends up having an impact 
on price. And expensive market-based child care appears to be a 
pretty widely recognized financial burden for working families. 
As I alluded to earlier, in a New York Times survey 64 percent 
of those respondents who said they expected to have fewer children 
said that they expected to have fewer children than they considered 
ideal, at least in part because they believed that child care was too 
expensive. 
To what extent do you think child care regulations are respon-
sible for higher child care costs? 
Mr. Bourne. It’s difficult to disentangle the demand and supply 
factors here. So there are good reasons to think that child care, 
even in a market economy, might become more expensive over time 
as people get richer. 
Formal child care is very labor intensive. It is difficult to auto-
mate in the same way that you can automate in the manufacturing 
sector. And for the big structural reasons that Dr. Waldfogel has 
talked about, there has been a big increase in demand for formal 
child care over time. And of course people tend to value their kids 
pretty highly, so they want a safe, loving environment for them. 
And for many, particularly upper income families, they want very, 
very high quality child care.

If you look across states, areas with the highest cost of child care 
also tend to be some of the richest states, which kind of feeds into 
this idea that prices are strongly income elastic. 
Yet, there is a lot of economic evidence, as I suggested, that regu-
lations of child care workers—in particular, the number of staff re-
quired per number of children, and also occupational licensing re-
quirements  as  you  alluded  to  in  terms  of  qualification  require-
ments—do raise costs pretty substantially. 
There has been some academic work that suggests if you relaxed 
across all age groups that staff-to-child ratio by just one child, it 
would reduce child care prices by about 10 percent. But actually 
these regulations are particularly regressive. The best study on this 
has been done by two economists, Joseph Hotz and Mao Xian. And 
what they did, they looked at comprehensive data and ran this 
econometrically, and what they found was staff-to-child ratio regu-
lation in particular had no effect in improving quality. What it did 
do, by driving up the cost of care, was in poorer areas it led to clo-
sure of formal centers. And that lack of availability of formal cen-
ters led to much greater use of home day care. 
So there is a massive tradeoff here, which is measures that peo-
ple say improve quality may well improve interaction time in the 
formal centers that still exist within a State, but if that means that 
many poorer families are unable to access formal child care we 
really have no idea what happens in terms of the quality of the in-
formal care that those people are offered. 
So I would say there is a big tradeoff. Lots of upper income par-
ents want and desire these sorts of regulations anyway, but what 
these regulations do is strip away the choice for lower income fami-
lies to select a different price regulation, price quality bundle. And 
that  can  have  severely  regressive  effects  in  terms  of  access  for 
those people to the labor market. 
Chairman Lee. Other than child care reforms, what are your 
other  favorite  policy  reforms  that  you  think  could  significantly 
lower the cost of living for low-income families? 
Mr. Bourne. Well the biggest expenditure is evidently housing 
costs. And I have outlined I think a key driver of housing costs in 
many major cities, particularly where economic opportunities are 
greatest, tend to be associated with overly restrictive zoning and 
land use planning laws. 
I do not think that we can really get to the nub of this afford-
ability issue without tackling that problem. Now evidently that is 
primarily a State and local issue, but that said, the Federal Gov-
ernment  through  schemes  such  as  the  Community  Development 
Block Grants does dish out Federal subsidies to states and local-
ities. And to the extent that those come without conditions about 
the supply environment, they can subsidize bad policy. So I know 
HUD has been looking at this, trying to work out a way of making 
sure that states and localities have plans to liberalize their plan-
ning laws. I think that is a positive step forward. 
And I also think with this rise of rent control as a potential solu-
tion being advocated, I would like to see Federal policy come with 
conditions that preclude those sorts of policies which would damage 
supply further.

Chairman Lee. Alright. After a while, I guess one does have to 
be careful about how far to intrude. I mean, you create one set of 
problems through the Federal Government, there is a response lo-
cally, and then we try to treat that remedy with yet another Fed-
eral remedy. 
My time for this round has expired. Mr. Heck, you are up to bat 
next. 
Representative Heck. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner, thank you very much for getting to the 
nubbins. Better wages, especially in light of the context of 30 years 
of  stagnant  wages.  Because  it  seems  to  be  underlying.  It  is 
foundational to all of these issues that we are dealing with. 
For purposes of discussion, I am thinking about kind of three dif-
ferent buckets in which the Federal Government could take action 
to affect people’s standard of living. And I am going to ask you each 
what is the thing that you think that we ought to do—the thing, 
if it were but one thing. 
But  first,  as  a  predicate,  let  me  describe  this.  We  can  either 
through the appropriation or the tax expenditure side impact those 
things that are really pinching people—skyrocketing costs associ-
ated with higher ed, housing, health care, child care, or just cash 
in the pocket, through lower taxes or EITC and the like. Bucket 
one. 
Bucket two, we can adopt those policies which lead to higher 
wages for at least some. Increase the minimum wage. At the Fed-
eral level, it has not been increased in 10 years, nowhere near the 
purchasing power then. More robust collective bargaining laws to 
favor the rights of workers. That is bucket two. 
Bucket three is the broader issue of just overall wages. In the 
spirit of disclosure, this is my favorite, I believe that the Federal 
Reserve has pursued a policy which has suppressed wage growth. 
In fact, in the last 10 years I believe there have only been two, 
count them, two months in which our labor supply increased by 
less than the replacement number in that month. Two months, in 
ten years. 
So we really have not had an approach to the cost of money, 
which truly gets us to full employment. Indeed, they keep changing 
their definition of what ‘‘full employment’’ is. They keep lowering 
it. And as a consequence, we have had very slow wage growth. 
So I am also reminded that what one of the chairs of the Federal 
Reserve once said, that is my favorite observation in this regard, 
which is: Recoveries don’t usually die of natural causes, they are 
murdered by the Fed. 
So we have these three buckets. And I am interested in knowing 
from each of you, quickly, beginning with you, Kristin, if I may. By 
the way, as an organization with a million members headquartered 
in my home State, let me just say we are all so proud of the work 
you do. Thank you. 
But if we were to do one thing—I want to go right down the 
line—one thing to make a difference, what would it be? Ms. Rowe- 
Finkbeiner. 
Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner. That is a tough question.

Representative Heck. I know. We get asked tough questions. 
We have to answer tough questions all the time. I am sharing the 
pain. 
[Laughter.] 
Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner. Thank you for sharing the pain. I would 
actually do all three. And that is because I know that we can do 
more than one thing at a time. I believe we can do it. 
What I know is that what we should not do is cut quality be-
cause we think that will cut costs. Because, I just want to make 
sure that we look at the fact that the return on investment on all 
of these programs goes up when we have increased quality. We 
were talking about this a moment ago relating to early learning 
and child care and in that discussion we should always be looking 
at the ROI going up as you have increased quality. 
So we really need to get into making sure that we are not cutting 
quality, we are not cutting care, and that we are moving forward 
wages. 
So if I had to pick one, you know, I am all three. I am going to 
see how Dr. Waldfogel handles this one. 
Dr. Waldfogel. So of course I am going to say all three, as well, 
because we should have full employment. We should have higher 
minimum  wages  and  more  stronger  bargaining  rights.  And  we 
should have a stronger—but I am going to pick one thing. 
Representative Heck. Not if you could choose one. How about 
which one do you think would make the biggest difference? 
Dr. Waldfogel. Well, I am actually going to come back to the 
universal child allowance, because I am going to say with these 
forces sweeping our economy, children should not be suffering be-
cause of this. So we have not even talked about the instabilities in 
the  economy  and  the  unstable  jobs,  people  whose  work  hours 
change from week to week, which means their earnings change 
from week to week. How do you pay for housing? How do you pay 
for child care when your earnings are changing from week to week? 
So what are you doing as a parent? What you are doing as a par-
ent is you are worrying about money all the time. So what impact 
is that having on your family life, and on your children? 
So I think children ought to be protected from these kinds of 
forces that are swirling around in our economy while we try to sort 
this all out. And so I think the Child Tax Credit is a fabulous pro-
gram in moving towards that goal, and I just think anything you 
can do to expand it to make it reach more families and become 
more universal, I think that is what we ought to be doing when we 
are thinking about helping families with kids and helping people 
making it more affordable to raise a family. 
Representative Heck. Thank you. 
Mr. Bourne—— 
Dr. Waldfogel. But I’m glad you are tackling the big challenges. 
Mr. Bourne. Well I am going to be more controversial and reject 
the premise of your question, which I think there is actually a 
fourth approach, which is to look at why are the costs of certain 
necessity goods and services so expensive at the first place and try 
and expand the supply side in those areas to make goods inher-
ently cheaper so negating the demand for more in the way of Fed-
eral borrowing, subsidies, and price and wage controls.

And I think a lot of the programs that we have mentioned no 
doubt could alleviate poverty. But given the fiscal conditions that 
you  guys  find  yourselves  in,  given  the  limits  of  what  you  can 
achieve through a tight labor market, and given the risks associ-
ated with wage and price controls, I think the principle of first do 
no harm, examine what policies on the books that currently raise 
the cost of living for  families  and poor  families in particular, I 
think that is a much better and fruitful approach. 
Representative Heck. Fair enough. Thank you, Mr. Bourne. 
Mr. Stone. So I am going to take the question in the spirit it 
was given and propose one legislative fix. However, in the spirit of 
Congress it will be a legislative fix with some riders attached. 
So we should take the EITC. We should repeal it. We should re-
place it with a wage subsidy that does not discriminate based on 
family structure. The EITC currently has a baked-in benefit for 
children. We do not want to lose that. So we should roll that into 
the Tax Credit, which we should then expand. 
And because we have to have a pay-for, we should pay for it with 
nominal GDP targeting at the Fed, which will increase economic 
growth. There you go. 
Representative Heck. Thank you. Thank you for your indul-
gence, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman Lee. Any time. Any time. I wanted to follow up on 
a couple of additional questions. 
Mr. Stone, in your testimony you submitted to the Committee 
you state that the declining marriage rate accounts for at least half 
of the increase in the fertility gap over the last decade. And for ba-
sically all of the increase since 2000. Is that right? 
Mr. Stone. That is correct. 
Chairman Lee. Can you explain to us why it is you believe mar-
riage rates are declining? And what, if anything, can be done—I 
would hesitate to find the right words here—I do not necessarily 
want to live in a country where we have got a brooding omni-
presence of a nanny state that is going to incentivize people to get 
married, tell them when it is time to get married. But I also do not 
want to live in a country where the government is disincentivizing 
people, or the government is artificially creating an environment in 
which people do not want to get married. 
Any thoughts on what we might be doing there? 
Mr. Stone. So this idea of the fertility gap, it is rising. And it 
is not because people are wanting more and more kids. The amount 
of kids they want is about stable. And fertility is falling. But when 
we look at how fertility is falling—and by ‘‘fertility,’’ I just mean 
birth rates—in fact for a women who gets married at a given age, 
her odds of having children and how many she ends up having are 
pretty similar to what they were 30 years ago. 
So this is almost entirely actually just about marriage choices. 
And of course marriage is being postponed. And for working class 
people, it is happening less frequently at all. People with a higher 
degree still get married at about the same rate they always did. 
This has been presented in the past as a class problem; that this 
is, oh, there is some cultural shift happening in these different 
groups of people. Maybe. Maybe. But it could also be that people 
without a college degree are far more likely to be exposed to exten-

sive marriage penalties. Their incomes tend to be in the range im-
pacted  by  that.  Which  then  brings  us  to  this  worry  about  this 
nanny state, or maybe more like a grandma state lecturing you 
about getting married—— 
Chairman Lee. A ‘‘grandma state.’’ That is the new term to 
come out. 
Mr. Stone. There you go. So nobody wants this, right? Nobody 
is saying I wish, I wish that the IRS would give me some advice 
about whether to marry my girlfriend, right? Nobody wants this. 
Luckily, this is not what we need. If the problem is the marriage 
penalty—and I think it is—then what we really need is we need, 
probably the first step is the most popular thing in Congress, to 
create a commission of some kind to study where are there mar-
riage penalties? Can we identify exactly where these things occur? 
And  once  we  have  identified  them,  can  we  come  up  with  some 
agreeable way to probably in an essentially spending-neutral fash-
ion, essentially rewrite the eligibility and benefit rules so that we 
are still spending the same amount of money on essentially the 
same income range of people, but we are doing it in a way that 
does not discourage family formation. 
This is not lecturing anybody getting married. It is not pres-
suring anyone to do anything they do not want to do. It is just say-
ing we made a mistake in how we wrote some of these programs 
in the past. They were not designed for a modern world where men 
and women are probably both working. And so when the eligibility 
threshold does not double, you have a serious problem. 
After we have done that kind of a study, I think we really need 
a rule. That is, whenever we score a bill, we really need that scor-
ing process to include does this, as a little check box, does this cre-
ate a marriage penalty? Yea, nay. And if it does, it would be nice 
to know. 
It is not a hard thing to calculate. So just having a bit of forward 
guidance on this as we go forward, when we have a new bill that 
affects individuals’ benefits or taxes, it should be scored: Does it 
create a marriage penalty? 
Chairman Lee. When you explain it that way, it becomes easier 
to understand how that could happen. Because it may be that in 
nominal terms the size of the penalty might seem smaller with re-
gard to some of those would-be couples than it is elsewhere in the 
economy. 
But in relative terms when you think about what that does to 
the marginal bottom line of families right in this sweet spot where 
it really makes a difference, that can have a big impact on behav-
ior. 
Dr. Waldfogel, I wanted to follow up on something. You co-au-
thored a 2016 study in which you show that the motherhood wage 
gap has declined, and that even in some cases it has been replaced 
with something of a wage premium for some groups of moms. Am 
I stating that correctly? 
In light of that, can you sort of discuss that finding and then tell 
us, is it fair to conclude that the affordability crisis is necessarily 
driven  by  a  motherhood  wage  gap?  Or  does  that  indicate  there 
could be other factors at play here?

Dr. Waldfogel. Yeah, I have been working on the motherhood 
wage gap for a long time. It was part of my Ph.D. at the Kennedy 
School more than 25 years ago—— 
Chairman Lee. When you were 12. 
Dr. Waldfogel. Yeah, when I was 12, thank you very much. 
Chairman Lee. A child prodigy. 
Dr.  Waldfogel.  Thank  you.  I  appreciate  that.  And  what  I 
learned in doing that work was women who did not have the oppor-
tunity to take a paid job-protected maternity leave often then were 
faced with an impossible choice. They would have a child. They 
faced an impossible choice. They did not have enough time off to 
stay home as long as they needed to with their baby. And so they 
would leave their job and they would come back a few years later, 
and they would start at the bottom of the labor market. 
And it took 10 or 15 years to get back on a par with the women 
who had not had children and were in similar jobs with similar 
training. So that is that motherhood wage penalty, and it lasts for 
a long time. 
Well fortunately we live in a world now where, although we still 
do not have paid family leave and child care in all employer set-
tings, we have it in a lot more than we used to back in those days 
when I was doing that research. 
So it does not surprise me that the motherhood wage penalty has 
narrowed over time. We still have a problem in terms of women’s 
earnings, but not as bad as it used to be. 
Of course, you know, at the same time other things have hap-
pened in the labor market and in the education system. Women 
now are getting more education than men. So if there is actually 
a group that we are worried about in the labor market, you know, 
as you know, it is the less educated men who really are taking a 
hit. 
So, yes, things have changed over time. 
Chairman Lee. That is helpful. Yes, you had something you 
wanted to add? 
Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner. Yes, I just wanted to follow up on what 
Dr. Waldfogel said. And that is, the mom wage gap is not gone. So 
when we are talking about the wage gap being lower, the 2018 
numbers that were built on U.S. Census data are that moms are 
making 71 cents to a dad’s $1. Women overall are making 80 cents 
to a man’s $1, women of all races, for full-time year-around work. 
So the motherhood penalty, the motherhood gap, is still very sig-
nificant and very, very strong. And so when we are looking at what 
is happening with solutions in our country, we need to address the 
fact that it is not just married or unmarried, or type of family that 
you are living in that is impacting the affordability of raising a 
family in America. It is also wage discrimination. And that wage 
discrimination  is  compounded  by  structural  racism.  So  moms  of 
color are actually experiencing the most wage discrimination. And 
single moms actually experience compounded wage discrimination 
too. 
According to 2018  data, single  moms are  earning  55 cents to 
every dollar earned by fathers. So when we are looking at solu-
tions, we need to absolutely look at pay parity solutions—things 
like the Paycheck Fairness Act.

We need to look at how to raise the economic security of all fami-
lies. We need to look at the fact that according to Johns Hopkins 
University 57 percent of births last year to the millennial popu-
lation were to unmarried women. And we need to acknowledge that 
82 percent of women in America do have children by the time they 
are 44 years old. 
So these solutions, if we just focus on narrow solutions, are not 
going to work for the majority of families. We need to make sure 
that  the  solutions  that  we  create,  we  create  for  all  of  working 
America, not just some. And that we do not replicate the structural 
inequities of the past. 
Chairman Lee. Did you have your hand up? Were you wanting 
to respond to that? Go ahead. 
Mr. Stone. I think it is worth emphasizing this motherhood pay 
penalty is not gone. It is very real. There is extensive research on 
this with really rigorous data from Sweden, Denmark, Germany, 
Austria, the U.K., the U.S., and it shows that in all of these coun-
tries there is an enormous motherhood penalty. In fact, it has al-
most no correlation with public benefits for child-bearing or moth-
erhood. It is almost entirely driven by local social norms, which 
suggest discrimination may very well be part of it, but also sug-
gests that our policies that we want to advance for families, we 
should justify them in terms of what we believe is right for fami-
lies, is good for families. We should not convince ourselves that by 
giving  paid  leave  we  are  going  to  eliminate—which  I  think  we 
should give paid leave—but we should not convince ourselves that 
we are going to eliminate a pay gap that exists even in countries 
that have programs far more generous than anything that we are 
talking about. 
These differentials are much harder to correct than what we con-
vince ourselves of in political discussions. So they may be worth 
doing. They may be worth doing because they are good for kids. 
They may be worth doing because they are a good communication 
about what we value in parents. They do not actually address the 
pay gap. That is a problem that actually almost no country has 
found a solution to. 
So we should keep in mind what is possible to achieve and make 
sure that we do not make promises that are going to end up being 
lies to people that we are trying to help. 
Chairman Lee. Dr. Waldfogel. 
Dr. Waldfogel. I just wanted to come back to the marriage ques-
tion, because I think it is a really important one. I just wanted to 
say that my colleague, Kathy Edin, who is at Princeton now, has 
done really the best research about why it is that low-income fami-
lies are postponing marriage. And she tells a very compelling story 
about families, young men and women, feeling like they need to at-
tain certain footholds before they can get married. They have to, 
you know, have completed their education. They have to have a de-
cent job. They cannot get married until they actually are stable on 
their feet. 
And so I have been thinking about the conversation we have 
been having this afternoon about high housing costs, and young 
people living upstairs in the bedroom of their family’s house, and

difficulties in the labor market, and these uncertain work sched-
ules. 
So, you know, I am all in favor of getting rid of marriage pen-
alties in public policies. We should not have marriage penalties, for 
sure. But we should think about the other things that are holding 
young people back from marriage. And they really need—and, you 
know, student debt we have been talking about. 
So it is no wonder that young people are delaying getting mar-
ried, given that they do not have a stable place to live, they are 
in debt from school, and they do not have a stable job. And in some 
ways we would not want them to be rushing into marriage in those 
circumstances. 
So it is one of those three-bucket things that is pretty complex 
to improve prospects for young adults. But boy, I think it is the 
most pressing challenge we face today, to improve prospects for 
young adults, because they are the parents of the future. 
Chairman Lee. Indeed. Mr. Bourne, we are going to let you 
speak, and then Mr. Heck is up. 
Mr. Bourne. I guess this is probably the one area here I demur 
from Mr. Stone, actually. I am skeptical of the idea that tax policy 
affects this type of behavior to a significant degree, or also that 
changing tax policy would lead to any significant change in fertility 
rates. 
I say that for two main reasons. I think first because if you look 
across countries that have very different tax and benefits systems, 
there has been a similar kind of secular decline in fertility rates, 
which suggests there is something bigger going on about people’s 
expectations and preferences as we get richer. 
But secondly, the mean age of first marriage for women is al-
ready much lower in the U.S. than in countries such as France and 
Sweden. But those countries have higher fertility rates. 
So this is one area where I just kind of question how much of 
an effect tax and benefit policy really has on this issue. 
Chairman Lee. That is an interesting point. 
Mr. Heck. 
Representative Heck. One last question, Mr. Stone. Our fer-
tility rate is, last I checked, just under 1.8, nowhere near replace-
ment. That obviously does not take into account immigration and 
therefore the overall population growth. But there is no question 
that we have been for awhile below replacement. 
And when I think about the kinds of programs we have like So-
cial Security, which depend on the number of active workers in the 
workforce supporting the program that supports those who are re-
tired, it begs the question about what are some of the long-term 
consequences  of  having  a  fertility  rate  which  is  below  replace-
ment—again, depending on immigration policy. And I suspect that 
there are some potentially serious implications. 
Would you care to just briefly enumerate some of them, please? 
Mr. Stone. So it would be easier to enumerate them if any of 
our long-term planning agencies like CBO, OMB, the Social Secu-
rity Trustees, if any of these agencies bothered to do a simulation 
that simulated a fertility rate below 1.8. The lowest scenario that 
Social Security Trustees even consider as possible in a most recent

update on the actuarial soundness of the Fund is 1.8—or 1.72 right 
now, and falling. 
So we are beyond the worst-case scenario of what any of your 
long-term planners have prepared for. You see the same thing in 
Census forecasts. They over-estimated the first year of their fore-
cast—they over-estimated population growth by 350,000 people in 
one year. That was a big miss. 
So the first step is just we should probably force our forecasting 
agencies to make sure that at least their first year of numbers is 
correct, let alone try to get a little more accurate on the out-years. 
Now given that we are not prepared for the demographic shift 
that is coming in terms of very low population growth, there will 
be significant consequences. We talked about housing wealth ear-
lier. 
There was an article in The Wall Street Journal a few weeks ago 
about lots of older Americans who have bought sizeable houses in 
nice exurban neighborhoods, and they were planning to sell them 
for their retirement, and no one is buying them right now. 
Well, there would be demand—— 
Representative  Heck.  Mr.  Stone,  let  me  just  interrupt  and 
interject something that is really important. A lot of those people 
want to down-size, and there is not a sufficient housing supply 
stock that they can get into, even if they could sell their home. 
Mr. Stone. Right. So you have a problem on both sides, that, 
one, they cannot sell the home because there just is not that much 
of a market there to buy it. That generation is smaller and also not 
as well-to-do. And second of all, the house they want to move into 
does not exist. 
Now but the truth is that we think about Social Security as an 
inter-generational  transfer.  The  entire  economy  is  an  inter- 
generational transfer. You own stock in a company that makes hot 
dogs? Well, guess what? There needs to be the kid who is going to 
eat the hot dog for you to sell it, for it to have any value when you 
sell it. 
Now we get a little bit of a free pass because our stock market 
is also, through a variety of channels, open to foreign investments. 
We get this nice thing where we buy goods from a foreign country. 
They take that money and they invest it into our securities, which 
is a nice handout for Americans as they grow older. But on some 
level there does need to be a next generation to consume those 
things to protect the value of the asset. 
So the long-term consequence of low fertility is permanent sec-
ular stagnation. That is, it is a permanent slowdown in economic 
demand. We heard a lot, which I appreciated, about wage stagna-
tion, and how productivity has been growing but wages have not. 
Well, it has been better than it has been in Japan, which one 
reason for that is because there has been no population growth. 
There has been no growth in demand in the market size. There is 
no plausible story where investing in Japan is wise, because there 
is not growth. What is the growth market here? 
So at the end of the day what you get is you get less entrepre-
neurship, less innovation. You get less economic growth generally. 
You get less sustainable public finances. What we call in economic

demography ‘‘aging with dignity’’ is very difficult. Very few coun-
tries achieve it. 
In  the  United  States  especially  with  increasingly  unhealthy 
aging through deaths of despair and things like that, is not well 
set up to handle this. We are facing a very serious issue down the 
road. 
So when we think about low birth rate, replacement rate is not 
what motivates me. I care about people’s individual desires and 
lives. I am not trying to get anybody to 2.1. If you want 3, I would 
love you to have 3. If you want one, have one. But on some level, 
you do need a society that continues to have some growth in the 
market. 
Now that can be through immigration. It can be. However, fer-
tility rates are falling in our traditional immigrant-sending coun-
tries. They are below replacement in most of the world. Beyond 
that, more countries like Japan are aging and saying, hey, we need 
immigrants. 
So there is more competition for those workers, as well. Net mi-
gration rates in the U.S. have been falling for three decades. They 
are going to keep falling, regardless of what happens with policy. 
So we cannot count that immigration is just always going to lift our 
fiscal boat. It won’t, not always. 
Representative Heck. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man. 
Chairman  Lee.  I  want  to  thank  each  of  you  for  being  here 
today. The testimony you have provided has been outstanding and 
very thoughtful. 
I thank all of the Members for coming and participating in the

And, we stand adjourned. Thank you.

PREPAREDSTATEMENTOFHON. MIKELEE, CHAIRMAN, JOINTECONOMICCOMMITTEE 
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for this hearing of the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee. 
The American economy is thriving. The current economic expansion is the longest 
in U.S. history. Our unemployment rate has remained below 4 percent for the past 
18 months. In recent years, we’ve seen consistently solid GDP growth and job cre-
ation. 
Yet, for many parents across this country, raising a family is harder and more 
expensive than ever. The New York Times recently surveyed adults 20 to 45 who 
were parents or planned to be. One in four had fewer children—or expected to have 
fewer  children—than  they  considered  ideal.  Economic  concerns  were  foremost 
among the reasons that they fell short or believed they would. 
Over the past few years, the Joint Economic Committee’s Social Capital Project 
has been documenting trends in our ‘‘associational life,’’ that is, the web of social 
relationships through which we pursue joint endeavors—our families, communities, 
workplaces, and religious congregations. A critical source of meaning and social cap-
ital is, of course, the family. That’s why two of the Project’s main policy objectives 
are: making it more affordable to raise a family, and increasing the number of chil-
dren raised by happily married parents. 
The goals of today’s hearing are to examine factors affecting family affordability 
and to explore policy approaches that would allow more Americans to start and 
raise the families they desire. 
Increasingly, ‘‘family affordability’’ has become a unifying concern among law-
makers and commentators on both the political left and right. We hear it in discus-
sions around topics as varied as child tax credits, declining fertility rates, increases 
in the cost of child care and housing, paid family leave, and student debt burdens. 
Motivating all of these discussions is a simple sentiment: It shouldn’t be this hard 
to raise a family. 
The problem is multifaceted. Economic challenges such as debt loads and in-
creases in the cost of living make family formation and expansion difficult for many 
Americans. Even many families that are economically stable must deal with the 
challenges of balancing work and family. Parents want to afford the best neighbor-
hoods and schools for their children, but that often leaves too little time to spend 
with them. As more families have sent two earners into the workforce, employers 
have been slow to accommodate their desire for balance. 
Meanwhile, Americans who might prefer something closer to a traditional single- 
breadwinner family face prices for housing and other expenses that are bid up by 
dual-earner households. And the growing ranks of single parents are hampered by 
their high poverty rates. 
The answer to ‘‘How did we get here?’’ is complicated. Our first step must be to 
adequately diagnose the problems facing our families. What fuels the rising costs 
of healthcare, child care, education, and housing? How many people are hindered 
in family formation by excessive student loan debt, inadequate income, or poor job 
prospects? To what extent does declining fertility reflect changing preferences, eco-
nomic barriers, or other factors? Does the rise of the dual-earner family signal in-
creasing hardship or simply changing values? 
The next step must be to come up with solutions. What is the best way to help 
more families afford time out of the workforce to care for newborns? Are there ways 
to increase work-family flexibility that are minimally disruptive to employers? Are 
there government policies that unintentionally have contributed to increases in the 
cost of housing, higher education, and health care—which can be reformed? How can 
we make the tax code fairer to parents who bear the costs of supporting future gen-
erations of Americans? 
Our panelists today will discuss some of these topics—and more. I look forward 
to their testimonies and to a productive conversation aimed at helping parents and 
strengthening our families. 
I now recognize Vice Chair Maloney for opening remarks. 
PREPAREDSTATEMENTOFHON. CAROLYNB. MALONEY, VICECHAIR, JOINT 
ECONOMICCOMMITTEE 
Chairman Lee, thank you for shining a spotlight on the challenges facing Amer-
ican families. 
We agree there is a problem. 
Today, millions of American families are working longer and harder—not to get 
ahead—but just to stay in place. 
Over the past four decades, wages have been stuck or have barely increased.

Meanwhile the costs of child care, education, housing and other necessities have 
grown. 
Most families rely on two incomes just to make ends meet. 
Nearly 40 percent of American adults report that they or their families have trou-
ble paying for at least one basic need like food, health care, housing or utilities. 
The picture is no brighter when you look at specific costs. 
Take child care. 
The average cost of center-based infant care is more than one-quarter of median 
household income for single working parents. That means those who need child care 
the most can’t afford it. 
Or look at college education—which is almost a necessity in today’s economy. 
Since the 1980s, the average cost of a full-time undergraduate degree has more 
than tripled for public and private institutions. 
Today’s typical graduate leaves college with $30,000 in debt. 
Or look at housing. 
Home prices are higher than ever and often out of reach. And over one-third of 
renters spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent. 
How are families responding to stagnant wages and growing costs? 
By taking on debt. 
Consumer debt, excluding mortgages, is now $4 trillion—its highest level ever 
after adjusting for inflation. 
Folks are also putting off home ownership, which can deprive them of a key 
source of wealth accumulation. 
Everyone in this room agrees that it’s more expensive than ever to raise a family. 
But we may disagree about the causes. And we may disagree about the solutions. 
I welcome the robust discussion that this committee provides. 
The entrance of women in the workforce is not the problem. We may hear that 
Americans got married less frequently or later in life as women took on careers, and 
that this hurt fertility rates. 
But women have become key drivers of our economic success. 
Women’s earnings boost the economy by trillions of dollars and are critical to 
American families. 
Women’s share of household earnings increased from 36 percent in 1993 to 45 per-
cent in 2016. 
Women could do even more if we made it easier for them to enter and stay in 
the workforce. 
There are two key, overwhelmingly popular ways to do that: offer affordable child 
care and paid leave from work. 
Let’s take a lesson from other OECD countries that provide these services and 
have significantly higher female labor force participation. 
And while we’re at it, let’s make sure that women are paid fairly so they have 
strong incentives to work. 
On average, a woman working full time year-round earns just 82 percent of her 
male counterpart. 
For Black and Hispanic women it’s far worse. 
For too many, the American Dream is slipping away or out of reach. 
Some would say that the solution is for the Federal Government to do nothing. 
I disagree. It has a key role to play in helping to restore that dream. 
What can it do? What can Congress do? 
Let’s start by lifting the minimum wage. 
The House has passed legislation to lift the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 and 
give 33 million Americans a raise. It’s time for the Senate to follow suit. 
We should expand programs and initiatives that we know work—like the Earned 
Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. 
The EITC substantially increases employment among single mothers and reduces 
poverty levels for their families. 
We should make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable to allow the poorest fami-
lies to receive the full benefit. 
The Working Families Tax Relief Act, which expands both the EITC and CTC, 
would benefit 49 million children, including 2.7 million in New York State. 
And we should strengthen the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. 
SNAP not only provides a healthy foundation for America’s current and future 
workforce, it’s also an investment in our economy. 
Every dollar of SNAP generates more than one and a half dollars in increased 
GDP. 
And, finally, we should join the rest of the industrialized world and provide paid 
leave to workers.

My bill, which was included in the National Defense Authorization Act that 
passed the House this summer, is a good start. 
It would provide 12 weeks of paid leave to Federal employees after the birth or 
adoption of a child or to care for a family member who has a serious illness. 
Raising a family is hard and rewarding work. 
We need to do more to provide workers with tools to balance their work and fam-
ily responsibilities. 
Today’s hearing and our witnesses’ testimony will shed light on the actions we 
can take to make raising a family more affordable.

There is a national shortage of affordable, quality child care, especially 
in rural communities. While many families struggle to find access to avail-
able child care, states are continuing to experience a noticeable decline in 
the number of child care providers, leading to the expansion of ‘‘child care 
deserts.’’ My Child Care Workforce and Facilities Act would provide com-
petitive grants to states to train child care workers and build or renovate 
child care facilities in areas with child care shortages. 
• In your testimony, you note that existing Federal child care policies are 
ineffective and consist primarily of subsidies that reach only about 15 
percent of eligible low-income families. Can you tell us more about how 
new Federal policies, including policies that seek to increase the sup-
ply of affordable, quality child care, can help fill this gap? 
Thank you for this question and for your leadership on this important issue. The 
tensions between child care affordability, quality, and access create difficulties for 
providers as well as consumers. Quality child care is expensive—and the reality is 
that low- and middle-income families cannot afford it without some kind of subsidy. 
But subsidies are very limited and in the absence of subsidies, many families have 
no choice but to use informal care or no care. The high cost of quality care also cre-
ates pressures for providers—so we should not be surprised to see many of them 
closing or cutting back. Yet families need quality, affordable, and accessible child 
care if parents are to work and if children are to be ready for school. So initiatives 
like yours to provide competitive grants to states to train child care workers and 
build or renovate child care facilities in areas with shortages are very much needed.

Over the past few decades, the cost of raising children has gone up much 
faster than most Americans’ wages. If we are going to build a stronger mid-
dle class, we need to make sure that Americans can work their way into 
it, which is why I support increasing the Federal minimum wage to $15 an 
hour. 
• Based on your research into this issue, how would you expect an in-
crease in the minimum wage to impact childhood development out-
comes? 
Study after study show that an increase in the minimum wage would significantly 
improve child development outcomes. The harm poverty causes to children is par-
ticularly damaging—and long lasting. Children in families in poverty are at a great-
er  risk  for  lower  IQ,  poor  academic  achievement,  developmental  delays,  and 
socioemotional and behavioral problems.1 This is underscored by a recent review of 
studies on the link between family income and child outcomes, which found over-
whelming evidence that higher household income results in positive child develop-
ment, including higher educational attainment.2 
Why are children helped so much by an increase in the minimum wage? Two- 
thirds of all minimum wage earners are3 women; and women—particularly women 
of color and moms—not only face wage, hiring, and advancement discrimination but 
are also at the epicenter of a huge crisis in our Nation related to wealth inequality 
and our rapidly shifting work structures, all of which significantly and negatively 
affects children since more than 80 percent of women in our Nation become moms. 
As a frame of reference, only 10 percent of all women in the labor force earn 
$75,000 or more annually, which means 90 percent of all working women earn less. 
In fact, 31 percent of women are in the next lower wage bracket, earning between 
$30,000 and $74,999 annually, and the majority of working women (59 percent) earn 
less than $30,000 annually.4

An impossibly low minimum wage is contributing to the appalling fact that one 
in every 30 children is homeless in the United States right now.5 
Too many women and families are struggling to get by and raise children in a 
changing economy where wealth inequality is expanding and the fastest growing job 
sectors are in low-wage industries, so raising the minimum wage is urgent for chil-
dren, women, and families.6These job sectors include retail, food service, and direct- 
care industries (which employ domestic workers and the people taking care of 
homes, children, and elders). It should be noted that domestic workers face incom-
plete coverage in the Fair Labor Standards Act and too often lack benefits and fair 
pay, which also urgently needs attention. 
In addition to the rapid expansion of low-paying jobs, the ‘‘gig economy’’—the 
short-term contract work replacing full-time positions—as well as disruption across 
industries, automation, and a shift from holding one or two jobs in our lives to many 
all demonstrate how work has changed for most Americans. 
Because of these shifts, and as the Federal minimum wage has remained stag-
nant, fewer and fewer women, moms, and families have access to economic protec-
tions that also cover children like job-based retirement income, health care, and 
other traditional employer-linked benefits that help stabilize economic security and 
open avenues for children to thrive. The need for universal protections and benefits 
that stay with the worker instead of being tied to a specific workplace, which every-
one—at every wage level—can access, is also becoming increasingly urgent. This ur-
gency is partly because jobs within the growing ‘‘gig economy’’ are largely missing 
these crucial protections. It’s also because today, the lower the wage someone earns 
at their job, the less likely that person is to have access to necessary workplace pro-
tections like earned sick days, paid family/medical leave, adequate health care cov-
erage, and affordable childcare. These protections are a given in most other industri-
alized countries. 
We are in a perfect storm. Shifting work structures, stagnant minimum wages, 
and a damaging lack of workplace benefits and protections are happening at the 
very same time families need women’s incomes to fuel their budgets and as female- 
dominated, low-wage jobs are among the fastest-growing employment sectors in our 
economy.7 
Increasing the minimum wage for everyone, and having one fair wage that in-
cludes tipped workers, is absolutely necessary to combat poverty in children and 
families, as well as to increase the health and success of children: 
• Studies find that as the minimum wage is increased, birth weight is also in-
creased, primarily because of increased gestational length and fetal growth 
rates.8 
• Studies show that economic hardship increases parents’ stress and reduces their 
quality time with children.9 
• All aspects of child development have been shown to have better outcomes when 
parents make living wages and can provide children with quality health care 
and child care, access to education, and support for their basic needs.10 
Further, increasing the minimum wage would not only have clear benefits for mil-
lions of children and low-wage workers, it would also strengthen our overall econ-
omy, especially since our economy and workforce are shifting quickly. 
As another frame of reference, in 2019 the Federal minimum wage is still stuck, 
as it has been since 2009, at the deplorably low rate of $7.25 per hour,11or $15,080

per year for a person who works full-time year-round with no breaks. And the Fed-
eral minimum wage for tipped workers is just $2.13 per hour. Nearly half of all cur-
rent minimum wage workers have had some college experience or an associates de-
gree. One in ten minimum wage workers has a bachelor’s degree or higher. Only 
20 percent of minimum wage workers are teens.12 The scale of the income inequal-
ity crisis overall is illustrated by the fact that 50 percent of all working people in 
our Nation make $17.81 per hour or less,13 which means that a large number of 
people are holding low-wage jobs. 
Think about those low numbers. Remember that women are currently 42 percent 
of all primary breadwinners for families and that three-quarters of moms are in the 
labor force contributing to the family income.14Particularly with women making up 
nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of minimum wage workers,15 raising the minimum 
wage would be a good start on the road to addressing the income inequality and 
poverty that women face, to break through the barriers holding children back, and 
to boosting our economy. 
But hold onto your hats, because the data gets even more troubling: The Federal 
minimum wage for tipped workers is just $2.13 per hour, and over half of tipped 
workers are women, disproportionately women of color, and over a quarter are 
moms. Tipped workers haven’t seen a raise in the Federal wage since 1991.16 
To be clear, as raising the minimum wage lifts children, it also boosts the econ-
omy, not the other way around. For instance, studies show that gradually raising 
the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would directly lift the wages of 22.5 million 
workers and affect another 19 million workers who would benefit from a spillover 
effect. All in all, raising the minimum to $15 in 2024 would directly or indirectly 
lift wages for 41.5 million workers, or 25 percent of the projected labor force in 
2024,17 which is a significant boost to our consumer-fueled economy.18,19 Further, 
because low-paid workers have to spend much of their extra earnings fairly quickly 
on the necessities of day-to-day life, including on raising children, this injection of 
wages would increase consumer spending, which would help stimulate the economy 
and spur greater business activity and job growth.20In fact, a study from UC Berke-
ley Labor Center found that the poverty-level wages paid by employers cost U.S. 
taxpayers $152.8 billion each year in public support for working families who other-
wise would not be able to put food on the table. 
In addition, by raising workers’ wages, fewer people will have to depend on pro-
grams like SNAP and fewer children would go hungry.21This is critically important 
because 11 million children in the U.S. face hunger right now, impeding their ability 
to grow and thrive.22

One study showed that raising the minimum wage would create 140,000 new jobs 
(or more).23 The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago says a raise in the minimum 
wage would help our economy by increasing household spending nationwide by 
roughly $48 billion. That’s enough to move the needle on our gross domestic prod-
uct.24 It’s clear that raising the minimum wage boosts children, families and our 
economy. (It’s no coincidence that Seattle, the city with the highest minimum wage 
in  the  country—approaching  $15  per  hour—also  has  the  Nation’s  highest  job 
growth. And that with Maine’s voter-approved minimum wage increase in 2017, 
10,000 Maine children were lifted out of poverty.25) 
It’s long past time to raise the minimum wage. Millions of children have parents 
who would benefit if the Federal minimum wage was raised26—and those children 
would benefit significantly too. The evidence is strong that child development out-
comes would improve with a higher minimum wage. Now is clearly the time to act. 
Thank you.

Measuring Affordability Over Time 
We’re here today to talk about whether or not family life in America has become unaffordable. In 
surveys of childbearing intentions, affordability and related financial concerns are one of the most 
commonly-cited reasons that families give for why they are not having children.1 And as any parent, or in 
my case soon-to-be-parent, is acutely aware, kids are indeed expensive. There are diapers, and baby 
food, and formula, and childcare, and piano lessons, and summer camp, and college, and the cost of a 
bigger house, and the minivan, and all these costs associated with normal American life.  
 
The most widely-cited statistic on the “cost of raising a child” comes from the USDA. Adjusting for 
recent inflation since their most recent estimate reflecting 2015 spending, USDA’s numbers suggests 
that a married, middle-income household in 2018 probably spends almost $260,000 to raise a child. 
That’s considerably higher than in 1995, when, in inflation-adjusted terms, a married, middle-income 
household would have spent about $220,000. 2 
 
USDA’s method is fairly straightforward: look at how families with kids spend their money, and then 
statistically allocate that spending to “statistical children.” They also track differences in spending across 
regions, age of child, income of parents, etc. The key thing to understand here is that USDA is not 
estimating the cost of raising a child with some fixed basket of goods: they’re just tracking and allocating 
what parents actually choose to spend.3 
 
And as parental spending on kids has changed, so has income. Using income data from the Current 
Population Survey, the USDA-estimated cost of raising a child in a married, middle-income household in 
1995 was about 3.3 years of those households’ incomes. But by 2015, despite rising child-rearing 
spending, the cost expressed in years-of-income had actually fallen! USDA’s 2015 estimates imply that 
the cost to raise a child in a married, middle-income household had fallen to 2.9 years of that 
household’s income! Child-rearing actually got cheaper over those 20 years, once we account for how 
much families actually spend and how much money they actually earned. 
 
Thus, by this crude metric, there’s no affordability problem at all. 
 
 
Changing Prices, Changing Norms: Decomposing USDA’s Child-Rearing Costs 
But when we look in greater detail, the story becomes more complicated. When we look at specific 
products that parents buy, a lot of them have seen their prices rise dramatically since the late 1990s. The 
nominal, USDA-calculated cost of raising a child grew by about 60% between 1995 and 2015. But the 
price of private school tuition rose 172%. The price of childcare and nursery care rose 109%. The price 
of apples rose 66%, while fees for lessons rose 77% and cakes and cookies rose 60%. Meanwhile, many 
other goods saw price increases lower than the total child-rearing cost increases, but still substantial: 
milk rose 35%, candy rose 44%, soup rose 27%, baby food rose 59%, paper products rose 28%. 
Recreational fees, kids’ shoes, juiceboxes, and many other items rose 10 to 25%. And then of course a 
few categories, most notably toys and childrens’ apparel, actually saw a decrease in nominal prices.4 This 
was largely due to Chinese imports and bankruptcies among American companies in those sectors. Toys 
R Us is a high-profile example of this, but there are others as well.

So as you can tell, the rise in child-rearing costs reflects a wide variety of shifting factors under the 
surface. Keeping your kid in clothes and with toys got a lot cheaper. Getting your kid educated got 
more expensive. But this all happened while incomes were, on the whole, for two-parent households, 
rising! What’s going on? 
 
USDA reports spending broken out by major categories: housing, food, transportation, clothing, 
healthcare, and childcare and education. It is helpful to look at these categories and decompose how 
much of the change in spending can be accounted for by price changes for specific products, versus 
changes in the things parents choose to buy. We’ll start with clothing, but data for all of these categories 
can be found in the figures in the appendix.5 
 
Clothing 
In general clothing costs have fallen since the late 1990s, yet total spending on clothes has risen. As a 
result, any reasonable estimate of parental spending on childrens’ clothing will reach a simple conclusion: 
Americans today are buying far more baby clothes than they used to, or else buying far higher-end baby 
clothes. That’s a behavioral change. Whether it’s an affordability question is debatable. Is parenting less 
affordable now because there’s a social norm of buying 30% more outfits, or 30% nicer outfits, than in 
the past? And that is the scale here: spending on clothing for kids has risen by 25% from 1995 to 2015, 
but the price of clothing for kids has fallen by about 6%. This means the quantity or quality of the 
clothing must have risen by about 30%. Now, replay the last few baby showers you went to! It adds up, 
right? 
 
But apparel is a unique category where the explosive growth of the Chinese textile sector after trade 
liberalization created unique pricing circumstances. Let’s look at a market that is less likely to have been 
disrupted by China: transportation.  
 
Transportation 
Transportation spending associated with having an extra kid has risen by about 60% from 1995 to 2015. 
But transportation prices, for things like cars, train tickets, and gasoline, have only risen about 47%. So 
aside from general inflation, parents are actually buying 10 or 15% more transportation, or perhaps better-
quality transportation. Maybe they’re driving more to soccer practice or vacations. Maybe they’re buying 
more plane tickets instead of driving. Maybe they bought more expensive kinds of cars, like hybrid or 
electric vehicles. The available data parsed by USDA can’t resolve that ambiguity, but the point is that 
while some of the change in child-rearing costs is driven by rising prices, which is clearly a question of 
affordability, some of it is driven by a behavioral change among parents. Whether this behavioral change 
is good or bad depends on exactly what change in spending occurred, and society’s value judgments of, 
for example, the cost of carbon emitted by airplane engines versus hybrid cars. 
 
Housing 
So we have some categories, like clothing, where parents spent more money despite falling prices. We 
have other categories where parents spent more money despite moderately-growing prices, like 
transportation. But we also have some categories where parents seem to have actually cut back on 
consumption, like housing and food. Housing expenditures have risen by about 37%, even as housing 
costs have risen about 70%. That suggests that the average American family in 2015 is facing much 
greater housing stress than in 1995. They’re cutting back by about a third in terms of real spending, in 
terms of the size of house, for sure, with square footage of new housing having been in decline for a 
decade, but possibly also quality of housing.6 Alternatively, parents may be settling for neighborhoods 
                                                             
5 See Exhibit 2 
6 See Exhibit 7 
they don’t want as much: further from work, further from family, lower quality schools, any number of 
factors could be in play. Academic research has demonstrated that neighborhoods have significant 
effects on children’s economic opportunities in life, so this kind of negative selection may be a very bad 
thing for society on the whole.7 In other words, there’s a very real “affordability problem” in the housing 
sector. 
 
This shows up in research directly focused on family formation as well. Higher housing costs reduce 
local birth rates.8 Local zoning and land use rules that drive up housing costs, like extremely long 
permitting processes full of extra paperwork and community approvals, or building codes that over-
prioritize extremely rare risks, or rules requiring minimum lot sizes and minimum parking amounts, have 
all been shown to reduce birth rates as well.9 Without a concerted effort to increase housing supply, 
and doing so without destroying the natural amenities and green spaces many residents value, the family 
housing crunch will continue and place serious negative pressure on younger people hoping to get their 
start in life.  
 
And I should note that this “vasectomy zoning” as it has been nicknamed is not always accidental.10 Many 
communities explicitly restrict the construction of new developments that they expect will bring in lots 
of children. Some communities, which are to all physical appearance normal neighborhoods, actually set 
rules on how many children can reside in the area, under the guise of providing suitable places for 
retirement. Many municipalities of a variety of sizes, but especially large, dense cities, have discovered 
that zoning out children is good for city finances: schools are expensive, and so-called “DINK” 
households, which stands for “double income, no kids,” create a lot of tax revenue, and a lot of demand 
for $15 cocktails and Barre studios.  
 
The issue with all of this is that children have to grow up somewhere. When municipalities engage in 
regulatory attacks on families, such as by forbidding daycares in their zoning codes, prioritizing parking 
spaces over places to play, or DC’s own absurd requirement of college degrees for paid childcare,11 
their victims are children, and, ultimately, the price is paid by the country on the whole in the form of 
disappointed parents, a shrunken generation, and lower economic growth. This testimony is generally a 
highly technical account, but here I cannot help but say that there is no way to be pro-family and not do 
something to tackle the housing problem. It’s not enough to give families a little more cash. It’s not 
enough to provide housing for the very poorest Americans. We need livable communities with 
obtainable market-rate housing for families. And if building enough houses to discipline housing prices 
enough to enable healthy family formation negatively impacts the resale value of some suburban 
McMansions, a concern often raised in local town zoning meetings, or even recently in the Wall Street 
Journal,12 then that is a reasonable price to pay.

Food 
Another category where parents may be experiencing some financial stress is on food. Food prices have 
risen by about two thirds since the late 1990s, and food spending has risen by about the same amount. 
So rising prices account for all of the increase in parents’ food spending. This is a bit surprising, since 
American farmers are getting more and more productive over time, and we are a major agricultural 
exporter. Food prices should not be breaking the bank in one of the most agriculturally productive 
nations on earth! What’s going on? 
 
Well, if parents never bought any restaurant meals, food prices would have risen a bit less, by just 63%. 
Prices of groceries have risen more modestly than food on the whole, because the price of eating out 
has risen considerably, by 72%. The two price indices track each other very closely until about 2016, 
when the price of food at home flatlines, and the price of food away from home continues to rise. It’s 
unclear what is driving this shift. It’s possible that it could be the rise of affordable food delivery services 
introducing new competition, changes in the prices of agricultural commodities, or something else. It’s 
also possible that the untethering of restaurant prices from food prices could be driven in part by the 
wave of minimum wage hike increases over the last few years; however, as with other categories of 
spending, it’s hard to say what exactly is driving these changes. 
 
But there’s a small caveat here. USDA tracks food spending, not food consumption. If families get food 
that they didn’t spend market income on, like through SNAP or WIC or food banks, it won’t show up in 
this data. To the extent that these programs have changed in generosity since 1995, that would be a 
change in food consumption not captured by USDA’s data. However, because I am focusing on changes 
among middle-income families mostly above the eligibility thresholds for these programs, the effect of 
excluding them should be quite modest. 
 
Education, Childcare, and Healthcare 
Up to this point, I’ve talked about cut-and-dried affordability. But as you can tell, I don’t think that the 
issue here is that families literally don’t have any cash to pay for necessities. Tellingly, the spending 
category with the fastest price growth, childcare and education at 125%, also had the greatest increase in 
real consumption, at 68%. In other words, families clearly had the money to spend on not only paying 
for increasingly-expensive childcare and education, but to buy a much larger quantity of these services. 
Since 1995, the share of school-age kids enrolled in private schools has been roughly stable despite 
explosive growth in charter schools competing with them.13 Meanwhile, the share of children ages 3 to 5 
enrolled in preprimary programs has risen slightly from 1995 to 2015, but the share of children enrolled 
in full-day childcare has risen sharply, from 30% to 42%.14 The fact that American parents appear to be 
buying more sessions of violin lessons, more hours of daycare, more years in private school, at a time 
when the prices of those things are rising at an incredible pace suggests that these middle-income 
households are in fact not extraordinarily cash-strapped versus previous generations of parents. 
 
As with education, so with healthcare: price increases have been dramatic, with prices doubling from 
1995 to 2015, but spending rose by even more. Real consumption of healthcare after accounting for price 
changes has risen nearly 20%. This data probably understates the rise in healthcare consumption, since it 
excludes healthcare covered by various government programs like CHIP or Medicaid, or the employer’s 
share of any payments. Combined with academic research finding that healthcare expansions do not in 
fact increase rates of childbearing,15 I think it’s reasonable to conclude that healthcare costs are not

directly and necessarily the primary driver of delayed or prevented family formation. 
 
There are real affordability problems facing families, like housing, as well as college costs which USDA 
does not consider. But on the whole, what we really see is American households making choices. When 
the price of clothing fell, they didn’t economize on clothes to pay for something else. American 
households of all income brackets used that price windfall to buy more clothes. And meanwhile, the 
income of these households rose. 
 
Achievability Is a Better Metric than Affordability 
So if aggregate affordability isn’t the problem, what is? And if there’s not actually some general shortage 
of cash in the household, why bother with family-supporting programs like the Child Tax Credit, or a 
family allowance (which I prefer to call a parenting wage)? 
 
Affordability as a concept is a bit tricky. It requires us to make a value judgment: middle-income married 
Americans will spend about $260,000 raising a kid. Is that affordable, or not? Well, it depends on who 
you ask! 
 
I prefer to think about family life in terms of achievability. The question here is not, “Can families afford 
to have kids?” but “To what extent do families end up having the number of kids they say they want to 
have?” I like this heuristic because it is more compatible with a pluralist, liberal mode of government: 
we’re not making a value judgment about what brand of lettuce you should buy or how many swimming 
lessons is too many. We’re just measuring what you say you want, and comparing that to what you 
actually achieve. 
 
According to a wide variety of surveys, the average American woman in 2018 says she wants to have 
around 2.3 to 2.5 children. This value has been approximately stable for 30 years.16 And yet, if current 
birth rates hold, the average young American woman in 2018 is only actually likely to have about 1.7 
children. That’s a gap of about 0.6 or 0.7 children, which is similar to saying that in a group of 10 
women, instead of the 24 children they said they wanted to have, they’re likely to end up with about 17. 
That’s 7 missing kids. That’s significant. 
 
It’s also a new problem. From 1990 to 2007, the fertility gap was consistently around 0.2 children per 
woman, far more modest. Now, during the 1960s to 1980s, the gap was also around 0.6 or 0.7 children 
per woman, but that was partly because it took longer for family size desires to adjust to modern family 
and economic norms. Many European countries have even larger fertility gaps, but that’s changing!17 
American women used to have much better fertility achievement than their European peers; now, our 
society is drifting into the middle of the pack, statistically speaking. 
 
If it’s not affordability per se, then what is it that’s driving this deficit of births versus what families say 
they want? One hint comes from the USDA itself. USDA’s data reflects the experience of a middle-
income married family. But marriage is increasingly being postponed. Fewer and fewer women in their 
20s and 30s are actually married.

global-fertility-gap 
No Ring, No Baby? 
And it turns out, marriage is the best predictor of whether women achieve their childbearing desires or 
not. In longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth, for both a cohort of Boomer 
women and a cohort of Millennial women, the more years a woman spent married, the smaller the gap 
between her desired and achieved fertility. In cross-sectional data from the General Society Survey, the 
fertility gap is far smaller among married women.18 And, as I discussed, among married families, the cost 
of raising a child has not changed drastically. 
 
If you’re like me, this is all a bit depressing. Incentivizing marriage is a tricky question in a diverse 
society! Americans are justifiably uncomfortable with being lectured about getting hitched by anyone, 
especially the Federal government! So if the problem is extraordinarily delayed marriage, as seems to be 
the case, then policy options seem a bit limited! 
 
But I think this reading would be a bit short-sighted, for essentially two reasons. 
 
Policy Options: The Marriage Penalty 
First of all, the federal government already has a marriage policy. And that policy is this: working class 
people should not get married, but middle class and wealthy people should. This is the policy stance of 
the tax code, of our welfare programs, of almost everything the government does. The tax code gives 
you a handy marriage bonus if you have a CEO in the family, as that CEO’s spouse is unlikely to earn an 
equivalent amount, and our tax brackets are of greatest benefit to families with the most lopsided 
spousal incomes. But if you’re in the EITC eligibility range, getting married could reduce your benefit by 
thousands of dollars. If you’re two working-class people with similar incomes, there’s a very real tax on 
marriage. 
 
Pivoting from taxes to means-tested benefits is even worse. The tax code at least makes some vague 
gesture at marriage-friendliness. Welfare benefits do not. Getting married can trigger the loss of tens of 
thousands of dollars worth of benefits ranging from housing, to food and nutrition benefits, to 
healthcare.19 This is true even in cases where both spouses would individually be eligible for these 
programs! The eligibility rules for welfare programs generally do not double the eligibility threshold for 
married couples, nor do they generally double the benefit size. In effect, the Federal government has put 
its thumb on the scales against working class marriage.20 It is perhaps no surprise then that, as the 
welfare state has expanded, marriage rates have been roughly steady among wealthier Americans, but 
have plummeted among the working class and poor. 
 
Let’s take two example working class couples to illustrate how all of this comes together: Liam and 
Emma, and Noah and Olivia. Let’s start with Liam and Emma. 
 
Liam and Emma: Working-Class Family With Kids 
Liam earns $24,000, and Emma earns $20,000. Emma has two children; let’s say Liam is their father, for 
the sake of this example.21 Neither of them are very wealthy, but neither of them are in extreme 
poverty. In fact, Liam is considerably above the poverty line, while Emma’s household of 3 is right at the 
line. They’re working class. Between income, payroll, and sales taxes, Liam will pay almost $4,000 in 
taxes. He makes too much money for the Earned Income Tax Credit, because the EITC is not very

20 Examples of several specific benefit and tax programs are provided in the appendix 
21 See Exhibit 5 for full scenario details 
generous to singles with no kids in the household. After taxes, Liam makes about $20,000. 
Emma’s story is different. Emma owes about $3,300 in taxes…. But they’re offset by $2,800 of 
refundable child tax credits for her two children, and $5,186 from the EITC. So Emma actually makes 
money on her taxes, even after accounting for her likely sales tax payments. She ends up with an after-
tax income of nearly $25,000. Combined, their after-tax incomes come to about $45,000, which means 
they together get a very small net subsidy from the tax code. 
 
Liam and Emma love each other. They’ve had kids together. But, for whatever reason, they’re not 
married; let’s say they’re living separately as well. What happens if Liam and Emma make the jump to get 
married and move in together, giving their two kids a more stable, two-parent household? 
 
Well, their income net of taxes actually falls! Their child tax credit gets more generous, rising to $4,000, 
because they can claim more of the non-refundable portion. But instead of getting Emma getting over 
$5,000 in EITC benefits, now they together get just $1,300, because the EITC is calculated very 
differently for married households. Altogether, Liam and Emma lose $2,500 on their taxes by getting 
married. 
 
But it doesn’t stop there! I also calculated Liam and Emmas SNAP benefits, Section 8 benefits, and their 
or their childrens’ benefits under CHIP, Medicaid, or ACA premium tax credits. When they aren’t 
married, Liam and Emma can, together, claim benefits worth over $20,000. But when they get married, 
they can only claim about $12,000 in benefits. They lose $8,000 in means-tested benefits by getting 
married, thanks to program-specific eligibility and benefit rules. 
 
Altogether, Liam and Emma’s choice to give their kids a stable, married, two-parent household costs 
them $10,500 every single year. That’s a quarter of their pre-tax, pre-benefit income. Liam and Emma 
are good parents who want the best for their kids: they stay unmarried so that they can pay for school 
supplies and have suitable housing and put nutritious food on the table. 
 
Noah and Olivia: Barriers to the Success Sequence 
Next we can look at Noah and Olivia.22 This couple is following what some researchers have called the 
“success sequence,” the idea that poverty can be avoided by doing life in a certain order. They got jobs, 
they haven’t had kids our of wedlock, and now they want to get married. Noah makes $19,000 and 
Olivia makes $18,000: both of them are above the poverty line, but they’re still far from rich. Both of 
them pay about 15% of their total income to taxes on income and consumption. Because they get no 
large credits, when they get married, their taxes are virtually identical. They have no meaningful 
marriage penalty in the tax code. So far, so good. 
 
But Noah and Olivia both get some very small SNAP benefits, and they both are eligible for some not-
very-small subsidized housing benefits. And, of course, they get some healthcare tax credits. Alas, when 
they get married, their combined income puts them above the income threshold for a two-person 
household to get many of their benefits. The result is that they lose over $4,000 in benefits when they 
get married, or almost 15% of their pre-tax, pre-benefit income. This means that getting married doubled 
their implicit tax rate. That’s a compelling argument for Noah and Olivia not to get married. 
 
These are simple examples with some crude calculations, but they illustrate that working-class marriage 
penalties are real and concerning. 
 
 
                                                             
22 See Exhibit 6 for full scenario details 
To be clear, the problem here is not “government benefits” per se. The problem is government benefits 
with eligibility rules that discourage working class people from marrying each other. And the result is 
neighborhoods with scattered families, inconsistent fathers, overworked mothers, and diminished 
opportunity for children. And, additionally, fewer kids overall. 
 
So there’s a very real way to make family life more affordable. Fix the massive government bias against 
marriage, and especially working-class marriage. It will be costly and complicated, but it needs to be 
done. 
 
The Parenting Wage 
The second response to the “marriage first” explanation for decreased family formation is to reconsider 
our justifications for policies like the Child Tax Credit. We don’t give parents the Child Tax Credit 
because children are unaffordable. If that were true, the CTC would have no phase-in, and would phase-
out at a lower income bracket. The justification for the Child Tax Credit is not that parents are 
inherently cash-strapped. The justification is that parenting is inherently valuable to society. We want to 
communicate that parenting is worthwhile work, that it is a dignified and worthy task. This is particularly 
important for a country like ours where gender egalitarianism is the expected social norm. The reality is 
that even in social welfare states like Sweden, many women stay home to be with kids. Society, and 
indeed the government, should communicate to these women, or to whomever works in the home, that 
their work within the home is recognized, is dignified, is seen as valuable. The social degradation of care 
work and home work is a catastrophe for gender equality, and ultimately sets home-makers of either 
sex up for entirely avoidable frustrations.  
 
In other words, we should have a parenting wage because parenting is important work, and workers 
deserve to be paid. In a society where the market increasingly intrudes into our children’s playtimes, our 
churches, and every facet of our lives, failing to provide competitive remuneration for the vital care-
work in the home leads to a systematic underprovision of that work. It leads to a crisis of parenting. It 
leads, in other words, to a demographic crisis. Personally, I hardly care whether a parenting wage comes 
in the form of a refundable credit or a new benefit. I only care that we, as a society, treat parents more 
generously than we presently do, and that we do so in a way that explicitly communicates to potential 
and actual parents that we see parenting as worthy, dignified, and important work. 
 
When societies do this, when they make significant increases in the benefits provided to parents simply 
for the labor of having kids, birth rates rise.23 Fertility ideals do not change very much in response to 
policy, and thus the fertility gap tends to narrow. The change in birth rates is, to be clear, quite modest. 
Without a change in marital behavior, fertility rates won’t rise by a lot. But they rise a bit. This is a one-
two punch: for family formation to improve in America, it’s vital to tackle both marriage and child-
rearing. And whatever happens to fertility rates, the children who are born are born into a society of 
greater opportunity, healthier families, and which engages in a valuable public catechesis: parenting 
matters.

Making It More Affordable to Raise a Family 
 
Testimony of Ryan Bourne, Cato Institute 
 
Before the Joint Economic Committee 
 
September 10, 2019 
 
 
Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today. 
 
Ensuring that a family can be raised affordably in America should be an uncontroversial public 
policy objective.  
 
Yet government policies at the federal, state, and local levels today raise prices of basic goods and 
services, to the disproportionate financial detriment of poor households and families with children.i 
 
Where households spend money 
 
Households across the income spectrum spend large amounts on goods and services that at their 
most basic should be considered “necessities.” Items such as food, shelter, transport, clothing, 
utilities, and, often, child-care services.  
 
The average household in the poorest 20 percent by income allocates 57 percent of its spending 
towards shelter, food, transport and clothing alone.ii The average married family with young 
children allocates 53 percent. Any meaningful analysis of family affordability must therefore 
consider the determinants of prices in these and other important product markets. 
 
 
 
The role of policy 
 
In recent years, housing and child-care affordability have become particularly pertinent political 
issues given their high toll on family budgets. High housing and child-care prices are often deemed 
market failures, necessitating corrective government intervention, price controls, or subsidies. 
 
But in both these product markets existing government regulations constrain supply, in turn raising 
prices. 
 
Extensive work has shown how overly-restrictive, local land-use planning and zoning laws 
constrain new housing supply, particularly in major cities.iii As demand for housing rises, an 
unresponsive supply of homes drives up the market price of housing services, forcing downsizing, 
longer commutes, or higher rents and mortgage payments on poorer families. 
 
Lesser known is that state-level child-care staffing regulations—notably, restrictive staff to child 
ratios and qualification requirements for workers—reduce the supply of child-care centers in poor 
areas, driving up prices and reducing formal care options for families.iv 
 
Again and again, one finds the same pattern of government policies increasing prices. The federal 
sugar  programv,  milk-marketing  ordersvi,  and  ethanol  mandates  raise  the  price  of  families’ 
groceriesvii; federal fuel-standard regulationsviii and state-level automobile dealership laws inflate 
the cost of drivingix; protectionist tariffs raise retail clothing and footwear pricesx; and state 
occupational licensing laws create barriers to entry for workers raising the price of services from 
hair braiding to dentistry.xi 
 
 
 
My research has sought to aggregate the price effects of all these policies. Using cautious 
assumptions, I find that, combined, they raise prices faced by typical poor families directly by 
anywhere between $830 and $3,500 per year.xii That’s between 7 percent and 30 percent of average 
after-tax income for households in the poorest quintile.xiii 
 
Given my analysis excludes much utilities and labor market regulation, this severely understates 
the negative price impacts government intervention has on basic goods and services. Nor does this 
calculation consider the potentially huge indirect costs. We know, for example, that elevated 
housing, child-care and transport costs make it more physically or financially difficult for families 
to access jobs with higher wages.xiv 
 
The benefits of a cost-focused affordability agenda 
 
Undoing the worst of these price-inflating, regressive regulations could therefore benefit poor 
families considerably.  
For example, estimates suggest that relaxing the average mandated staff-to-child ratio by just one 
child across all age groups would reduce child-care prices by 10 percent or more.xv On housing, 
some economists estimate that lowering regulation levels in just New York, San Francisco, and 
San Jose to the median of all US cities would raise nationwide GDP by nearly 9 percent.xvi 
Addressing government policies that drive high prices at the source would also dampen the 
demands we see for risky rent control measures, affordable housing mandates, higher minimum 
wages, government subsidized child-care, and new tax credits and allowances. 
 
Conclusion 
 
My main message is therefore simple: before proposing new or expanded federal programs we 
should acknowledge that important pro-market reform levers already exist to improve family 
affordability, particularly at the state and local government level.  
 
These regulatory changes, especially in housing and child-care policy, do not require yet more 
federal borrowing, nor do they come with the risks associated with wage and price controls further 
worsening the availability of housing, child-care, and low-skilled job opportunities. 
 
Such a “cost-based, affordability agenda” may not be the full or final answer to the affordability 
challenge you’re considering. But before reaching for new programs or regulation, we—through 
government policy at all levels—should at least attempt to undo the harm caused by existing 
policies.

Hearing on “Making it More Affordable to Raise a Family” 
 
September 10, 2019 
 
Chairman Lee, Vice Chairwoman Maloney, and other Members, 
 
Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me to speak with you today. 
 
I’ve spent the past 25 years studying policies to support families and promote child well-being. These 
policies are a pressing concern for our country because 11.5 million children (nearly 16% of all 
children) are poor, and another 27 million (37%) have incomes just above the poverty line.1 And of 
course, it’s not just poor and near-poor families that struggle to make ends meet.  
 
Much of my recent work uses the Census Bureau’s new supplemental poverty measure, which allows us 
for the first time to gauge the effects of the full range of social policies Congress has enacted to support 
families and promote child well-being.2 That work makes it clear that two sets of policies are critically 
important in reducing poverty among families with children. Refundable tax credits – the Earned 
Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC) -- moved 4.5 million children out of poverty 
(reducing child poverty by 6 percentage points) in 2017 (the most recent year for which we have data), 
and the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)  and other food and nutrition programs 
(school lunch and WIC) moved 2.4 million children out of poverty (reducing child poverty by more than 
3 percentage points).3 We also have good evidence that these policies reduce family stress and improve 
child health and development.4

while SNAP and other nutrition programs moved 5 million people out of poverty, of whom 2.4 million were children.

But income poverty is not the only challenge that families face. Since 2012, with the support of the 
Robin Hood foundation, our group at Columbia has been surveying New York City residents, tracking 
material hardship and ill health as well as poverty.5 Our findings reveal that poverty is just the tip of the 
iceberg – while 1.6 million New Yorkers (1 in 5) are poor, 4.4 million (more than half) face either 
poverty or material hardship or serious health challenges.6 So, it’s not just families below the poverty 
line who struggle to put food on the table and pay their bills and cope with ill health – and in a city with 
a large charitable and philanthropic sector, including Robin Hood which spends 100 million dollars a 
year fighting poverty.  
 
So what can we do to better support American families? We need to start by recognizing that in the 
majority of American families, it is no longer commonplace for there to be a stay-at-home caregiver.7 
This trend is not going to change – most two parent families need to have both parents in the labor 
market, and of course difficulties in balancing the competing needs of work and family are even more 
acute among low income and single parent families.8 
 
However, our public policies have not kept pace with this new demographic reality. The Family and 
Medical Leave Act still provides only unpaid leave, and to only about 60% of the workforce.9 Federal 
child care subsidies reach only about 15% of eligible low-income families who need them.10  
 
Employer policies address some of the gap but mostly for more advantaged employees. While 40% of 
employees have access to some paid leave they can use for maternity, paternity, or to care for a seriously 
ill family member, those who are low-income, part-time, or Hispanic are much less likely to be 
covered.11 Only a tiny share of employees – about 10% - receive any help from their employers in 
paying for child care.12

Yet we know from a large body of research that these policies matter for the well-being of employees 
and their families.13 In addition to evidence from Canada, the United Kingdom, and Europe, we now 
have more than a decade of evidence from California whose first-in-the-nation paid family leave law 
came into effect in 2004.14 When employees have access to paid family leave, they are more likely to 
take leave to care for a family member or for themselves, and they are more likely to be employed and 
have higher earnings afterwards.15 Mothers who have access to paid leave are less likely to be depressed 
after a birth and also breastfeed for longer.16 When fathers take longer leaves, they are more likely to be 
engaged in caring for their children months later, and mothers are in better mental health.17 When more 
paid leave is available, rates of infant mortality and hospitalizations fall.18 At the other end of the 
lifecycle, so too do nursing home admissions.19

Opinion surveys consistently show that Americans favor paid family and medical leave.20 They 
understand that the need is widespread and they appreciate the benefits. This is why 8 states to date – 
CA, RI, NJ, NY, WA, MA, CT, and OR – and the District of Columbia have enacted paid family and 
medical leave laws that provide a period of paid leave – to care for a newborn or a seriously ill child or 
family member, or when a family member is deployed or returning from in the military – with many 
more considering such legislation.  
 
These policies are also endorsed by employers. My colleagues and I have been surveying employers in 
states with paid family and medical leave laws – focusing especially on small employers who are often 
missing from such surveys. In three states with paid leave laws – RI, NJ, and NY – we found that two-
thirds of employers were supportive of the laws; another 15-20% were neutral.21   
 
The evidence on child care is also extensive and clear. Research from the landmark National Institute of 
Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care, and many subsequent studies, have 
shown that high-quality child care improves children’s health, cognitive development, and social 
development, with especially beneficial effects for disadvantaged children.22 Yet too few Americans can 
afford quality child care, especially in early childhood when care is most expensive.23 When more child 
care subsidies are available, parents are more likely to be employed, reducing poverty and promoting 
family economic stability. Indeed, our estimates suggest that universal child care could move 630,000 
children whose families pay for child care out of poverty (reducing poverty by more than a third among 
families with children under the age of 13 paying for child care).24 In addition, when more subsidies are 
available, more children receive child care and are in care of higher quality.25 This is important for child

well-being because high quality care can play a crucial role in helping improve school readiness and in 
narrowing gaps in readiness.26  
 
But we also need to look at what government can do to help families where a parent is not working, or 
not able to work enough hours. A spell of unemployment, or challenges in finding a job or enough 
hours, could befall any of us, and it is the role of the safety net to buffer that instability. Public programs 
such as SNAP and private charities such as food pantries play a crucial role – but families also need cash 
to buy their children clothing and school supplies, and to pay rent and utilities. For this reason, virtually 
all our peer countries have some form of universal child allowance or child benefit, paid monthly (or 
more frequently) to all families with children.27 Our Child Tax Credit is the closest policy the United 
States has to serving this role for many American families – but unfortunately leaves out the lowest 
income for whom it would have the biggest impact.28 Indeed, 23 million American children (1 in 3) live 
in families who earn too little to receive the full Child Tax Credit of $2,000 per child authorized under 
the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).29 This includes over half of Black and Hispanic children, the 
overwhelming majority (70%) of children in single parent households, 40% of young children under 6, 
and 42% of rural children.30 Extending the Child Tax Credit to include the poorest families would move 
about 2 million children out of poverty (reducing child poverty by more than a fifth) and would move 
about 1 million children out of deep child poverty (family income below half the poverty line) (reducing 
it by more than a third).31 This should be a high priority and it is encouraging that proposals to do so 
have received bipartisan support.

In summary, while there is ample evidence about the critical role of current safety net policies like the 
EITC and SNAP as well as the efforts of charitable and philanthropic groups like Robin Hood, it is also 
clear that we need to do more. It is high time we joined our peers in providing paid family and medical 
leave, quality affordable child care, and a universal child allowance. These are not just vital supports for 
family economic well-being. They are also essential for the health and development of our children.

CEO/Executive Director and Co-Founder

Joint Economic Committee  
 
Hearing on Making It More Affordable to Raise A Family  
September 10, 2019 
 
Thank you, Chairman Lee and Vice Chairwoman Maloney, and members of the Joint Economic 
Committee for the opportunity to testify at this important hearing on Making it More Affordable 
to Raise a Family. I want to commend you for holding this hearing today because these issues are 
shaping our future, our country’s future, and the futures of generations to come.   
I’m Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, Executive Director/CEO of MomsRising, an organization with 
more than a million members, including members in every state in the nation, working to 
increase family economic security.  
We are on the frontlines of the crisis facing families in America right now.  Experts in this room, 
and around the nation, agree: It’s getting more and more expensive to raise a family and that fact 
has dire consequences. [1] It doesn’t have to be this way.    
This crisis is born of policies that are outdated and that fail to address the realities of today’s 
economy and the struggles working families face.    
In good news, this crisis is solvable. We can update our policies. We can make change. And the 
policies MomsRising supports, that I will talk about shortly, will boost our families and our 
economy. So while our organization is named MomsRising, the work we do lifts dads, 
grandparents, people with all types of families, and of course moms. 
The situation is urgent. At MomsRising we hear from people experiencing this crisis each day. 
 
Stories like this one from Joan, a working mother right here in our nation’s capital dealing with 
high monthly costs of student loans, groceries, utilities, housing, and child care.  Joan pays 
$1,170 per month for child care for her youngest child, plus additional funds for after-school 
care for her five-year-old, who is in public kindergarten.  
 
Joan and her family are far from alone in facing a crunch of compounded costs. In fact, it’s so 
expensive to raise a family these days that one in six children in our country now live in food-
insecure households. [2]  
 
Take Jamie, from New Jersey, who reached out to us in 2017 when she was a pregnant mom. She 
worked part-time, only when her husband could be home, because they couldn’t afford child 
care. Even though he had two part-time jobs, they struggled; and until they started getting 
  1 
SNAP, their four-year-old and Jamie herself went without healthy food. It would come down to a 
choice: pay bills or buy groceries. If they chose to pay bills, they went without fruits and 
vegetables. And if their grocery bill went up, debt collectors would come calling. 
  
Nobody who is working, let alone holding multiple jobs, should have to struggle to put food on 
the table. But too many families face stark choices like Jamie’s.  Too many families face steep, 
unmanageable costs:  
 
•  Housing costs, both rental and ownership, are now too high for far too many. One in 
three households are now paying more than 30% of their incomes for housing, and more 
than half are renters. [3]  Home ownership -- a key source of wealth accumulation -- is 
now out of reach for a growing number of families because home prices have risen faster 
than wages in most markets. [4]  When so much of your income has to cover housing, the 
regular costs of daily life, like feeding your family and paying utilities, become even 
harder to meet. 
 
•  The cost of education has also skyrocketed. College tuition has tripled since the 1980s. 
[5]  While future earnings are significantly higher for those who graduate from college 
than for those who do not, [6]  student debt now exceeds a trillion dollars with students, 
on average, carrying tens of thousands of dollars in debt when they graduate. [7] That is a 
huge burden for young families to shoulder. 
 
•  Child care costs are also sky high. In fact, child care now costs more than public college 
in most states [8] and Black and Latinx families often end up having to spend more of 
their annual income on child care than anyone else. [9]  This is despite the fact that every 
parent needs safe enriching places to be so they can work, children need quality early 
education so they can thrive, and child care workers need to be paid living wages so they 
can succeed. 
 
Let me tell you, too, about Meredith from Florida: She and her husband planned for seven years 
before having children, but still ended up with student loans, health care, child care, and 
housing costs that made it hard to stay afloat.  Their oldest is on the autism spectrum, and 
requires a separate health care plan, which doesn’t cover many of his therapies and 
medications. Their student loans cost as much as a car payment. They paid $1,000 per month for 
child care and now that their kids are older, after-school care -- especially for a special needs 
child -- is expensive. They lived with her parents to save enough money to buy a home of their 
own, and even then it was difficult. Meredith says she never imagined that two people who did 
everything right would find it so hard to make ends meet. 
 
The writing is on the wall: Our country, our workforce, and our economy have changed, but our 
public policies haven’t kept up.  They are woefully out-of-date and families are suffering as a 
result.   
 
The terrible truth is that, as costs have been rising, wages have been largely stuck for decades.  In 
fact, over the past nearly 30 years, net productivity rose by 70%; but hourly pay stagnated. 
[10]  Translated, this means wealth inequality is increasing, the benefits of productivity are only 
  2 
experienced by those few at the very top, and most people raising children in America are facing 
a financial crunch.  
 
This situation can’t be ignored. Data show that the bigger the gap gets between the rich and the 
poor, the less overall economic growth there will be. That, in turn, reduces economic security -- 
and hope. [11]  
 
Inequality in all its forms is a too often silent, persistent, and pernicious crisis—and one that has 
disproportionate impacts. For instance, because of wealth inequality, one recent study found that 
a middle-class income doesn’t directly correlate with middle-class economic security for 
everyone. For instance, white households earning an annual income between $37,201 and 
$61,201 owned eight times as much wealth as Black people in that same income bracket, and ten 
times as much as Latino people in that same income bracket. [12]  The racial wealth gap is much 
bigger than the wage gap, and this affects whether whole communities are able to pay for things 
like college, time out of the labor force, retirement, starting a business, buying a house, passing 
down resources to children, investments, sabbaticals, and much more. [13]  This is a big deal and 
one of many examples of why our fight for equity and equality must always be intersectional. 
Suffice to say that the United States isn’t doing well when it comes to addressing wealth and 
income inequality overall. In fact, the United States of America is now the third worst nation in 
terms of income inequality—after Chile and Mexico—among the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development countries. [14]   Our high level of income inequality led MIT 
economist Peter Temin to assert that we’re regressing to developing nation status. In 2017, 
Temin noted that the United States has largely become a two-track economy, with roughly 20 
percent of our population educated and in good jobs, and 80 percent working in the low-wage 
sector with little hope of advancement. [15]  
On top of this, women are being pushed even further behind by wage, hiring, and advancement 
discrimination: Women of all races on average are paid just 80 cents on the dollar [16]; and 
moms of all races experience increased wage discrimination, earning an average of just 71 cents 
to dad’s dollar, with moms of color experiencing compounded wage discrimination due to 
structural racism.  [17]  This is happening despite the fact that there is a direct correlation 
between high levels of women in corporate leadership and higher profits—and despite the fact 
that promoting women often leads to outperforming the competition.  [18]  
 
The U.S. Census reported in 2018 that women, on average, earned just 80 cents to a man’s dollar 
for all year-round full-time workers; [19] women of color, on average, experience significant 
increased wage hits: [20]  Latina women earn only 53 cents; Native American women only 58 
cents; Black women only 61 cents; and Asian women only 85 cents on average for every dollar 
earned by white, non-Hispanic men. And it should be noted that the broad data category of Asian 
women doesn’t give the whole picture: [21]  A closer look at the numbers inside that number, for 
instance, reveals that Burmese women are earning only 50 cents to a white man’s dollar, Fijian 
women are earning 68 cents, and Laotian women are earning earn 58 cents. [22]  And to get a 
closer picture of what’s really going on in our nation, here are specific numbers [23] relating to 
moms: Latina mothers are paid just 46 cents; Native mothers are paid 48 cents; Black mothers 
are paid 54 cents; white, non-Hispanic mothers are paid 72 cents; and Asian/Pacific Islander 
mothers are paid just 92 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic fathers.) 
  3 
 
So what’s happening with these wages? One series of studies painted a stark picture of hiring, 
workplace, and wage discrimination: Moms were hired 80 percent less often than women with 
equal resumes who didn’t have children; and when moms were hired, they were offered salaries 
$11,000 lower on average than the salaries offered to non-moms. On the other hand, dads with 
equal résumés were offered $6,000 more than non-dads, [24] proving that the antiquated and 
false idea that only men need paychecks large enough to support their families persists, causing 
intense damage, and keeping many families poor and hungry. Studies have also shown that 
mothers are judged more harshly in the labor force, even when they have the same credentials as 
non-mothers. [25]   
 
Discrimination is at work when it comes to the motherhood pay penalty.  Michelle J. Budig, 
writing in Third Way, reports that the motherhood penalty, “Cannot be explained by human 
capital, family structure, family-friendly job characteristics, or differences among women that 
are stable over time…This motherhood penalty is larger among low-wage workers while the top 
10% of female workers incur no motherhood wage penalty.” [26]  
 
Further, while moms overall across all races are paid just 71 cents to every dollar that dads are 
paid, [27] the discrimination in pay compounds for single moms and their children. Paid just 55 
cents for every dollar paid to all fathers, [28] single mothers are among those who face the worst 
wage discrimination [29] in our nation. This impacts a tremendous and growing number of 
women and children. A study from Johns Hopkins University found that 57 percent of babies 
born to millennials were not born within a marriage. Technically these are “single mothers” by 
many people’s definition, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a partner present. These and other 
numbers demonstrate the extensive nature of deeply unfair pay gaps that women and moms are 
facing.  
Unfair pay causes grave and lasting harm to those who are in low-income jobs in particular: 
Mothers in low-wage jobs are paid just 66 cents for every dollar paid to fathers in low-wage 
jobs; [30] and we can’t forget that 90 percent of women earn less than $75,000 a year, and more 
than half of them earn less than $30,000 a year. [31] Too many women and moms are working 
hard, being paid unfairly, surviving paycheck to paycheck, and falling into poverty as they 
struggle to raise families and open doors for their children to thrive.   
Families urgently need women’s wages to make ends meet and to survive economically; as does 
our national economy.  In fact, women became half of our country’s full-time labor force for the 
first time in the last decade, [32] and three-quarters of moms are now in the labor force, more 
than half of whom are the primary breadwinners [33] for their families.  Further, in our 
consumer-fueled economy, women and moms make nearly three-quarters of purchasing 
decisions. [34] That’s a lot of consumer power. But it also means that when people aren’t paid 
fairly and don’t have funds to spend, our entire economy suffers. 
  
On the other hand, when women are economically successful, so are men, and so is our overall 
economy: If women received pay parity, it would cut poverty by more than half for women and 
families, add $512.6 billion to our national economy, [35] and increase our gross domestic 
product by at least 3 percent. [36]  
  
  4 
It’s time to move our policies into the 21st century so women, families, and our economy can 
thrive.  The lack of adequate federal economic security and equal pay policies harms working 
people who are paid unfairly, their families who count on their paychecks, and our nation’s 
economy. 
 
Not to be overlooked is that our mass incarceration policies further compound the economic 
harm to many families. The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world [37] and 
54 percent of inmates are parents with children under the age of 18. [38]  Mass incarceration 
devastates family economic security in the short- and long-run, tears families apart, and hurts 
children and communities.  
 
Congress needs to advance innovative solutions that make families stronger and also continue 
successful safety net programs like: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), 
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), the earned 
income tax credit (EITC), Child Tax Credit (CTC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 
(TANF), Head Start, Medicaid, and more. Each immediately injects funds into our consumer-
fueled economy and allows people to buy the groceries and other basic goods and services they 
need to survive and thrive. For instance, for every $1.00 that goes into funding SNAP, our 
economy gets back $1.70. [39]  
 
One thing is clear: Solutions are possible.  Small changes and big change. It all adds up. 
 
In good news, there is growing momentum for policy change that lifts families, businesses, and 
our economy alike.  For instance, nine states and dozens of municipalities have passed paid 
family leave policies [40], and 50 locations across the nation have passed earned sick days. [41] 
Many states are also passing pay equity laws. 
 
These wins include:  
 
•  New York, which passed a historic paid family and medical leave law that went into 
effect last year and was available to 8.5 million New Yorkers.  [42]  
 
•  Massachusetts, which passed a strong pay equity law to stop the use of prior salary 
history in setting current pay so historic wage discrimination won’t be compounded. The 
law also protects people from retribution for discussing wages with coworkers, which 
only a few states do. [43]  
 
•  Washington State, which passed the Childcare Access Now (CAN) Act to address child 
care affordability, quality, and workforce compensation. [44]  
 
But to really move the needle, we need change at the federal level because when this many 
people are having the same problem at the same time, we don’t have an epidemic of personal 
issues, we have national structural issues we can and must solve together.  That’s why we’re 
pushing for: 
 
•  Paid family/medical leave for everyone in our nation  
  5 
•  Affordable, accessible, high quality child care  
•  Health care for all, including access to reproductive health care 
•  Paycheck fairness 
•  Earned sick days and reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers. 
•  Living wages, which means increasing the federal minimum wage and abolishing the 
tipped wage 
•  An end to mass incarceration, the school-to-prison pipeline, and child and family 
detention 
•  Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC) 
•  Investments in children and families including SNAP, Headstart, WIC, the school lunch 
program,  child care assistance and more. 
•  Comprehensive gun policy reform to reduce the devastating costs of gun violence. 
 
Advancing policies in these areas will be good for women, men, all family types, and the 
economy.  The return on investments are high. For instance: 
 
•  Studies show for every dollar invested in child care, there is a return on investment up to 
$9.00; [45]  
•  A failure to make adequate affordable housing available now incurs greater costs for 
future generations; [46]  
•  Advancing paid family medical leave and earned sick days, which most other nations 
have done, increases work productivity and retention, decreases mortality, and state 
studies show paid family medical leave could save approximately 40% in TANF and 
SNAP costs; [47]  
•  On average, adults with a college degree earn $920,000 more than those without one 
during their lifetimes; [48]  
•  Studies also show that advancing economic security policies like paid family/medical 
leave and affordable child care help lower the wages gaps between women and men, 
moms and non-moms.  [49]  
 
Adopting these policies isn’t just the right thing to do for our families, it’s the smart thing to do 
for our economy.  
 
We need to attack the challenges from multiple angles – better, fairer wages, updating our 
outdated policies, and making basic necessities more affordable.  We need to move quickly to 
pass the FAMILY Act, the Childcare for Working Families Act, the Working Families Tax 
Relief Act, the MOMS Act, the Healthy Families Act, and the Maternal CARE Act; as we also 
raise the federal minimum wage and have it cover all workers, ensure everyone has access to 
health care coverage, make college and housing affordable, and more.   
 
Our to-do list is long, but we are up to the challenge because these solutions don’t just lift 
families, they lift our nation.  When we update our outdated policies to address today’s realities 
and economy, we all win. 
 
We can, and we must, make it more affordable to raise a family in America -- and together we 
will.

Thank you.

Opening Statement  
JEC Hearing on “Making it More Affordable to Raise a Family” 
September 10, 2019, 2:30pm 
216 Hart Senate Office Building 
 
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for this hearing of the Joint Economic Committee. 
 
The American economy is thriving. The current economic expansion is the longest in U.S. 
history. Our unemployment rate has remained below 4 percent for the past 18 months. In 
recent years, we’ve seen consistently solid GDP growth and job creation.  
 
Yet, for many parents across this country, raising a family is harder and more expensive than 
ever. The New York Times recently surveyed adults 20 to 45 who were parents or planned to 
be. One in four had fewer children—or expected to have fewer children—than they considered 
ideal. Economic concerns were foremost among the reasons that they fell short or believed 
they would.  
 
Over the past few years, the Joint Economic Committee’s Social Capital Project has been 
documenting trends in our “associational life,” that is, the web of social relationships through 
which we pursue joint endeavors—our families, communities, workplaces, and religious 
congregations. A critical source of meaning and social capital is, of course, the family. That’s 
why two of the Project’s main policy objectives are: making it more affordable to raise a family, 
and increasing the number of children raised by happily married parents. 
 
The goals of today’s hearing are to examine factors affecting family affordability and to explore 
policy approaches that would allow more Americans to start and raise the families they desire. 
 
Increasingly, “family affordability” has become a unifying concern among lawmakers and 
commentators on both the political left and right. We hear it in discussions around topics as 
varied as child tax credits, declining fertility rates, increases in the cost of child care and 
housing, paid family leave, and student debt burdens. Motivating all of these discussions is a 
simple sentiment: it shouldn’t be this hard to raise a family.  
 
The problem is multifaceted. Economic challenges such as debt loads and increases in the cost 
of living make family formation and expansion difficult for many Americans. Even many families 
that are economically stable must deal with the challenges of balancing work and family. 
Parents want to afford the best neighborhoods and schools for their children, but that often 
leaves too little time to spend with them. As more families have sent two earners into the 
workforce, employers have been slow to accommodate their desire for balance.  
 
Meanwhile, Americans who might prefer something closer to a traditional single-breadwinner 
family face prices for housing and other expenses that are bid up by dual-earner households. 
And the growing ranks of single parents are hampered by their high poverty rates. 
 
The answer to “How did we get here?” is complicated. Our first step must be to adequately 
diagnose the problems facing our families. What fuels the rising costs of healthcare, child care, 
education, and housing? How many people are hindered in family formation by excessive 
student loan debt, inadequate income, or poor job prospects? To what extent does declining 
fertility reflect changing preferences, economic barriers, or other factors? Does the rise of the 
dual-earner family signal increasing hardship or simply changing values? 
 
The next step must be to come up with solutions. What is the best way to help more families 
afford time out of the workforce to care for newborns? Are there ways to increase work-family 
flexibility that are minimally disruptive to employers? Are there government policies that 
unintentionally have contributed to increases in the cost of housing, higher education, and 
health care—which can be reformed? How can we make the tax code fairer to parents who 
bear the costs of supporting future generations of Americans?  
 
Our panelists today will discuss some of these topics—and more. I look forward to their 
testimonies and to a productive conversation aimed at helping parents and strengthening our 
families. 
 
I now recognize Vice Chair Maloney for opening remarks.

Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney (NY-12) 
Vice Chair of the Joint Economic Committee  
“Making it More Affordable to Raise a Family”  
  
September 10, 2019  
  
Chairman Lee, thank you for shining a spotlight on the challenges facing American families.  
 
We agree there is a problem.  
 
Today, millions of American families are working longer and harder—not to get ahead—but just 
to stay in place.    
 
Over the past four decades, wages have been stuck or have barely increased.  
 
Meanwhile the costs of child care, education, housing and other necessities have grown.  
 
Most families rely on two incomes just to make ends meet.  
 
Nearly 40 percent of American adults report that they or their families have trouble paying for at 
least one basic need like food, health care, housing or utilities.  
 
The picture is no brighter when you look at specific costs.  
 
Take child care.  
 
The average cost of center-based infant care is more than one quarter of median household 
income for single working parents.  That means those who need child care the most can’t afford 
it.  
 
Or look at college education—which is almost a necessity in today’s economy.  
 
Since the 1980s, the average cost of a full-time undergraduate degree has more than tripled for 
public and private institutions. 
 
Today’s typical graduate leaves college with $30,000 in debt.  
 
Or look at housing.    
 
Home prices are higher than ever and often out of reach. And over one third of renters spend 
more than 30 percent of their income on rent.  
 
 
How are families responding to stagnant wages and growing costs?  
 
By taking on debt.  
 
Consumer debt, excluding mortgages, is now $4 trillion—its highest level ever after adjusting 
for inflation.  
 
Folks are also putting off home ownership, which can deprive them of a key source of wealth 
accumulation.   
 
Everyone in this room agrees that it’s more expensive than ever to raise a family.  
 
But we may disagree about the causes. And we may disagree about the solutions.  
 
I welcome the robust discussion that this committee provides.  
 
The entrance of women in the workforce is not the problem. We may hear that Americans got 
married less frequently or later in life as women took on careers, and that this hurt fertility rates.  
 
But women have become key drivers of our economic success.  
 
Women’s earnings boost the economy by trillions of dollars and are critical to American 
families. 
  
Women’s share of household earnings increased from 36 percent in 1993 to 45 percent in 2016.  
 
Women could do even more if we made it easier for them to enter and stay in the workforce.   
 
There are two key, overwhelmingly popular ways to do that: offer affordable child care and paid 
leave from work.  
 
Let’s take a lesson from other OECD countries that provide these services and have significantly 
higher female labor force participation.  
 
And while we’re at it, let’s make sure that women are paid fairly so they have strong incentives 
to work.  
 
On average, a woman working full time year-round earns just 82 percent of her male 
counterpart. 
 
For Black and Hispanic women it’s far worse.    
 
For too many, the American Dream is slipping away or out of reach.   
 
Some would say that the solution is for the federal government to do nothing.  
 
I disagree. It has a key role to play in helping to restore that dream.  
 
What can it do? What can Congress do?  
 
Let’s start by lifting the minimum wage.  
 
The House has passed legislation to lift the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 and give 33 million 
Americans a raise.  It’s time for the Senate to follow suit.  
2 
 
 
We should expand programs and initiatives that we know work—like the Earned Income Tax 
Credit and Child Tax Credit.  
 
The EITC substantially increases employment among single mothers and reduces poverty levels 
for their families.  
 
We should make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable to allow the poorest families to receive 
the full benefit.  
 
The Working Families Tax Relief Act, which expands both the EITC and CTC, would benefit 49 
million children, including 2.7 million in New York State. 
 
And we should strengthen the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. SNAP not only 
provides a healthy foundation for America’s current and future workforce, it’s also an 
investment in our economy.  
 
Every dollar of SNAP generates more than one and a half dollars in increased GDP.   
 
And, finally, we should join the rest of the industrialized world and provide paid leave to 
workers.  
 
My bill, which was included in the National Defense Authorization Act that passed the House 
this summer, is a good start.  
 
It would provide 12 weeks of paid leave to federal employees after the birth or adoption of a 
child or to care for a family member who has a serious illness.   
 
Raising a family is hard and rewarding work.     
 
We need to do more to provide workers with tools to balance their work and family 
responsibilities.   
 
Today’s hearing and our witnesses’ testimony will shed light on the actions we can take to make 
raising a family more affordable.

statement will be read into the record and we can continue, but I 
can start with my opening statement. And I am very pleased to 
hold this hearing, examining the many economic uses of the Cen-
sus and other Federal data, particularly by U.S. businesses. 
Census data is the only source of objective and comprehensive 
data about the Nation’s demographic characteristics down to the 
neighborhood level. The decennial Census provides the foundation 
for other Federal surveys, including the American Community Sur-
vey. The ACS tracks social, demographic, economic, and housing 
data, including educational attainment, income and earnings, em-
ployment status, and housing value. 
Census data are an essential building block, or benchmark, for 
most nationally representative surveys, public and private, helping 
us to understand the economy, our workforce, and opportunities for 
growth. Businesses use Census data to make economic and stra-
tegic decisions that determine the flow of almost $4 trillion in an-
nual private investment. They use it to decide where to locate or 
expand operations, where to open new stores and distribution cen-
ters, even what products to sell in which stores.

It affects where and how advertisers spend their dollars. When 
businesses plot their strategies, they look at Census data to under-
stand the skills of the workforce, and the characteristics of poten-
tial customers. 
Let’s take a few examples. David Kenny, the CEO of Nielsen, in 
a recent New York Times op-ed, described how businesses rely on 
Census data to make a broad range of strategic decisions. The Cen-
sus is used to identify where, for example, to put power lines, cell 
towers, and hospitals. 
Target told us that the U.S. Census is one of many resources 
that it uses to better understand the communities where they do 
businesses. 
In  the  7  Rivers  region,  which  includes  Southwest  Wisconsin, 
Southeast Minnesota, and Northeast Iowa, hundreds of businesses 
and community leaders are using Census-based data to craft strat-
egies, to fill jobs, and boost labor-force participation. 
It starts with using data to understand who is unemployed. Who 
has left the labor force? How much education have they attained? 
How  do  local  workers  compare  to  others  nationwide?  Are  they 
younger? Older? More likely to be male or female? 
The strategies that emerged from a careful analysis of the data 
are varied. One approach is to expand childcare, to make it more 
attractive for women with young children to enter the labor mar-
ket. The 7 Rivers Alliance is just one example. Every day, compa-
nies across the country make decisions based on Census data to 
chart their future. 
The decennial Census is used to apportion representation in the 
United States House of Representatives, and to determine alloca-
tion of Federal funds. Hundreds of billions of Federal dollars and 
fair political representation are on the table, and depend on the 
Census. 
Where we build roads, bridges, schools, and other core infrastruc-
ture is based on Federal data. How we target funds to address can-
cer, obesity, and other health challenges depends on the Census. 
Unfortunately, the 2020 Census has been politicized through the 
citizenship question. Immigrant communities, already skeptical of 
the Federal Government, are reluctant to take part in a survey 
that they believe could be used against them, jeopardizing their 
status. 
A recent study at Harvard found that the citizenship question 
could  lead  to  6  million  Hispanics  missing  from  the  count.  That 
means  Hispanics  would  be  underrepresented  in  Congress,  and 
would  receive  less  in  Federal  dollars.  It  means  that  businesses 
would not get accurate data about the role Latinos play in the U.S. 
economy. It means the 2020 Census would not provide a fair and 
accurate count. 
The point of the Census is to get a full count of the population. 
Any proposals that would limit or discourage participation would 
run counter to this very objective. This would undermine the integ-
rity of the Census data, inflicting substantial harm on businesses 
and others that depend on accurate data, and it would undermine 
the right of every American to be represented. 
Now, getting the count wrong would be costly with far-reaching 
effects on nearly every segment of the population and on nearly

every  industry  in  our  economy.  We  would  be  misallocating  re-
sources through misguided business investments, and poorly tar-
geted government expenditures. We would be using flawed data on 
the basis for making and evaluating decisions, and we would be 
doing this for a decade. 
Accurately counting all of our people should not be a partisan 
issue. Businesses, researchers, policymakers, State and local gov-
ernments, all count on the data that flows from the Census. We 
should all work to make it as accurate as possible. I look forward 
to the witnesses’ testimony, and I am so pleased to welcome the 
chair of the committee for his opening statement. 
[The prepared statement of Vice Chair Maloney appears in the 
Submissions for the Record on page 28.] 
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE LEE, CHAIRMAN, A U.S. 
SENATOR FROM UTAH 
Chairman Lee. Thank you very much. It is a pleasure to be 
here, and I appreciate you, Vice Chair Maloney, for putting to-
gether this hearing on this important topic. 
Today, Federal data and surveys provide the American people 
with a lot of information, including some invaluable information 
about our society and our economy. But there are two key cat-
egories of information that are currently absent from our Federal 
surveys, categories that I would like to highlight a little bit during 
today’s hearing. 
First, our Federal surveys, and in particular, the American Com-
munity Survey, or ACS, and Current Population Survey, or CPS, 
fail to include information about past involvement with the crimi-
nal justice system. In other words, they do not tell us whether 
someone has been convicted of a crime, or has been put on proba-
tion, or on parole, or whether they have been incarcerated at some 
point during their lives. 
Such data would, I believe, be invaluable for understanding how 
much these experiences might serve as a barrier to employment. 
For example, it would help us answer questions like how many 
people  are  out  of  the  labor  force,  because  they  have  criminal 
records?  And  how  does  this  vary  in  terms  of  geography  and  in 
terms of the geographic makeup—the demographic makeup of any 
particular community? 
In our own research on prime-age men who are out of the work-
force, the JEC’s Social Capital Project has found that one-third of 
these men have been incarcerated. And there is further evidence to 
suggest that men who are not employed are much more likely to 
have a criminal record than men who are. Indeed, we ought to 
have a fuller picture of this often-forgotten segment of our popu-
lation, and figure out what we might do to help them, or what we 
might be doing to hinder them, what impacts our laws might be 
having on them, that we are not aware of, or that we didn’t intend. 
Our goal should be to make sure that our criminal justice system 
is, in fact, just that the punishment fits the crime and the criminal, 
being neither too lenient, nor too harsh, and to help these men and 
women  reenter  society  and  become  productive  members  of  their 
families and of their communities.

That is precisely why I have worked with many of my colleagues 
on legislation to this end, legislation like the First Step Act, which 
was signed into law by the President after being passed by both 
Houses of Congress in December, and which included some much- 
needed sentencing and prison reforms. 
Having  complete  data  on  these  topics  in  our  Federal  surveys 
would only further assist us in accomplishing these goals, these 
same goals as set out and identified and passed into law in the 
First Step Act. 
Second, our surveys include limited information on social capital, 
and on what we call associational life, which is arguably the most 
important factor in understanding our Nation’s health and happi-
ness. The Current Population Survey includes a few questions on 
social capital and associational life since 2002. But there is still a 
whole lot of information that is lacking, that we don’t even seek. 
For instance, it provides little information on trust or confidence 
in our institutions, especially local ones. It does not track loneli-
ness, happiness, or the availability of emotional support. It does 
not include information on the availability of public amenities, like 
libraries, parks, and playgrounds, which have been shown to have 
a high correlation with things like community involvement. 
The CPS could—and I believe should—provide more information 
on the social integration that takes place between families, among 
friends, neighbors, congregants, and coworkers, and it could pro-
vide important details on the ways that technology hinders and 
helps social integration and interaction. 
Furthermore,  having  more  social  capital  information  in  these 
surveys would help all of us, simply because, as research shows, 
strong  social  capital  is  conducive  to  finding  and  getting  work. 
Learning this information would provide some missing pieces to a 
puzzle, giving us a clear picture of ways we can strengthen our 
economy, and help our citizens be happy and productive members 
of their communities. 
So, I look forward to hearing our testimony from these witnesses 
today, and grateful that you would be willing to join us. Thank you, 
Vice Chair.

missions for the Record on page 29.]

STATEMENT  OF  ANDREW  REAMER,  RESEARCH  PROFESSOR, 
GEORGE  WASHINGTON  INSTITUTE  OF  PUBLIC  POLICY, 
GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY 
Dr. Reamer. Chairman Lee, Vice Chairman Maloney, and dis-
tinguished members of the Joint Economic Committee, I appreciate 
your invitation to speak today about the economic impacts of the 
2020  Census  and  the  business  uses  of  Federal  data.  The  wide-
spread  use  of  data  derived  from  the  decennial  Census  by  busi-
nesses  and  nonprofit  organizations,  workers,  and  students,  and 
Federal, State, and local governments, has a substantial positive 
effect on the vitality of the U.S. economy and the Nation’s 6 million 
private firms. 
Data sets from the decennial Census are rarely used themselves 
in economic decisions. They are only gathered once a decade, and

they only collect a few variables like age, sex, and race, but they 
are essential for economic decision making, because the decennial 
Census  provides  the  foundation  for  the  development  of  three 
groups of Federal data sets that guide public and private economic 
decision making. 
The first group is the annual population estimates and the hous-
ing estimates which are essentially updates of the data collected in 
the decennial Census. 
The second group are household surveys, including, as Mr. Lee 
noted, the American Community Survey, the Current Population 
Survey, and the Consumer Expenditure Survey that collect data on 
variables that are not in the decennial Census. 
And  the  third  group  are  data-derived  data  sets  that  are  geo-
graphic classifications, urban and rural classifications, and core- 
based statistical areas, all based on the decennial Census. 
The vitality of the Nation’s economy and the 6 million businesses 
inside it are greatly affected by decisions made by using Census- 
derived data—by the businesses themselves, by the Federal Gov-
ernment, State and local governments, workers, and students. 
Businesses depend on Census-derived data to determine whether 
to open a business establishment in a particular community, based 
on market demand and the availability of qualified labor, where to 
site  that  establishment  based  on  transportation  and  journey-to- 
work patterns; how large to make that establishment in terms of 
employment and capital investment; what goods and services to 
provide, based on population size and characteristics; and once they 
are in business, to measure their market share and market pene-
tration. 
The Federal Government uses Census-derived data that affect 
the U.S. economy and businesses through four avenues: one is, as 
Vice Chair mentioned, the Census and Census-derived data deter-
mine apportionment and redistricting. 
Secondly,  they  determine  Federal  economic  indicators  such  as 
CPI, gross domestic product, unemployment, and poverty rates. 
Third, again, as the Vice Chair mentioned, the Federal Govern-
ment uses Census-derived data to annually allocate over $900 bil-
lion geographically to cities and states across the country through 
325 Federal spending programs. 
And fourth, multiple agencies like FEMA and government-spon-
sored  enterprises,  like  Fannie  Mae,  use  Census-derived  data  to 
shape policies, programs, and plans that affect businesses. 
State  and  local  governments  also  use  Census-derived  data  in 
multiple ways that affect businesses. They use data to draw legisla-
tive boundaries. They rely on these data to determine how best to 
deliver services, where to place schools, highways, and health clin-
ics, how to design police patrols, and how to respond to natural dis-
asters and other emergencies. 
State governments rely on Census-derived data to project reve-
nues and expenditures so they may balance their annual budgets. 
Half of State governments use Census-derived data to implement 
tax and expenditure limitations. 
Also, State agencies use Census-derived data to direct federally 
funded sub grants to local governments, sub grants such as Title 
1, WIOA, CDBG, and WIC.

Finally, students and workers use Census-derived data to make 
decisions  that  affect  labor  availability  to  businesses.  Students 
choose careers and career pathways based on Census-derived data, 
and workers use the data to determine where to look for a job, and 
in which neighborhood to live. 
In sum, economic policy and business decisions depend on the ac-
curacy of the 2020 Census. If full accurate responses to the Census 
are not forthcoming, the American economy and its businesses will 
suffer. 
Mr.  Chairman,  Madam  Vice  Chair,  and  committee  members, 
thanks for the opportunity to speak, and I am pleased to answer 
any questions you might have. 
[The prepared statement of Dr. Reamer appears in the Submis-
sions for the Record on page 31.] 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you so much. 
Mr. Fienberg. 
STATEMENT OF HOWARD FIENBERG, VICE PRESIDENT, 
ADVOCACY, INSIGHTS ASSOCIATION 
Mr. Fienberg. Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Maloney, and com-
mittee members, thank you very much for the opportunity to tes-
tify today about the importance of the 2020 Census to American 
businesses. 
Census data don’t just underpin American democracy or guide 
Federal spending, although those are important, but for us, they 
form the backbone of data-driven decision making in the private 
sector. This data helps U.S. businesses promote economic develop-
ment, identify and serve customers, and create jobs. 
I am wearing two hats today at this hearing. The first is for the 
Insights Association, nonprofit association representing the mar-
keting research and data analytics industry. Our members are the 
world’s leading producers of intelligence analytics and insights, de-
fining the needs, attitudes, and behaviors of consumers, organiza-
tions, and their employees, students, and citizens. 
And with that essential understanding, a leader can make intel-
ligent decisions, and deploy strategies and tactics to build trust, in-
spire innovation, realize the full potential of individuals and teams, 
and successfully create and promote products, services and ideas. 
Now, research studies in the U.S. require the most accurate de-
cennial data in order to produce statistically representative sam-
ples of the U.S. population or segments thereof. Even the most es-
sential Federal Government surveys like the American Community 
Survey, or ACS, formerly known as the Census Long Form, are 
built  on  decennial  Census  data.  Without  accurate  Census  data, 
American businesses can’t know what America needs. 
My second hat is co-director of The Census Project, a broad-based 
coalition of national, State, and local organizations and companies 
that support an inclusive and accurate 2020 Census and ACS, in-
cluding hundreds of State and local government groups, business 
trade associations, labor unions, academia, and civil rights activ-
ists. 
While the Census Bureau aims for 100 percent accounting of the 
U.S. population every 10 years, it rarely achieves that goal. Hard- 
to-count populations in areas, such as remote and rural areas, ra-

cial and ethnic minorities, young children, and low-income house-
holds, are normally undercounted. But small inaccuracies in Cen-
sus data can have a big impact, especially in the business world, 
which is why Congress must fully fund the 2020 Census as soon 
as possible. 
Now, the Census data explains more than just how many people 
live where. Although that is an important aspect. Many companies, 
whether large multinationals or fledgling small businesses, we use 
the intricacies of Census data to decide where, when, or if to site 
a business, find the right consumer base, discover and satisfy con-
sumers’ unmet needs and wants, identify and locate the best work-
force to run their business or where the best workforce of the fu-
ture may be coming from, take risks on up-and-coming neighbor-
hoods,  and  discover  locations  with  the  right  infrastructure  and 
funding behind them. 
On the other side of the coin, economic development agencies, 
like  the  Greater  Houston  Partnership,  utilize  good,  transparent 
Census data at the neighborhood level to attract and retain busi-
ness investment from around the world to those cities, based on 
labor data, education levels, and traffic patterns. 
Data-driven decisions are even more reliant on accurate Census 
data when they involve smaller, hard-to-count demographic groups 
or areas. Starbucks can easily open another coffee shop in Manhat-
tan’s  financial  district,  but  it  takes  the  most  accurate,  Census- 
based insights to justify one in rural Arkansas. 
Census data cover all American communities down to the neigh-
borhood, and Census track levels so that we can accurately com-
pare an East Asian immigrant neighborhood in downtown New Or-
leans  to  a  low-income  Hispanic  suburb  of  Austin  and  a  mostly 
white, middle-class small town in rural Washington. 
The trickle-down impact of an inaccurate 2020 Census would re-
strain or ruin American businesses for a whole decade. For exam-
ple,  Utah-based  Qualtrics,  an  Insights  Association  member  pro-
viding software to measure and improve the customer experience 
for thousands of brands around the world, would struggle to pro-
vide those insights with the data—and provide the data necessary 
for those that experience, absent Census benchmarks, statistical 
sampling. 
A utility company would not know where to site new cell towers, 
electric transmission lines, or water lines. So certain communities 
would go without enough coverage, while others might end up un-
necessarily oversaturated. 
An obstetrics practice might not be opened in an area growing 
dense with young family households if Census data can’t accurately 
reflect the neighborhood’s demographic trends, costing the medical 
practice profits and the local community the benefits of care. 
A business might not invest in a certain neighborhood without 
special tax treatment for requisite concentrations of lower, mod-
erate-income  households,  incentives  that  would  be  unavailable 
without accurate Census data to qualify them. 
An Insights Association member conducting public opinion poll-
ing would not know how representative a survey’s results of con-
tentious political issues would be of the total population, let alone

important demographic segments, leaving policymakers and stake-
holders guessing. 
Insights Association members measuring the U.S. media audi-
ence and thus setting the rates for advertising, publication, and 
programming across the country would not be able to represent the 
whole audience without accurate Census data, leading ad spending 
and  media  programming  to  target  the  wrong  areas  and  demo-
graphic segments, miss others entirely, or not be produced and de-
livered at all. 
Finally, retail companies would be unable to conduct extensive 
market analysis needed to accurately determine where, what, and 
when to build, nor be able to accurately forecast their sales, delin-
eate trade areas, or manage their supply chain. 
The  dependence  on  accurate  Census  data  of  American  busi-
nesses, especially the marketing research and data analytics indus-
try, drives our advocacy for adequate resources for the Census Bu-
reau. We are extremely concerned about cancellation of essential 
2020 Census field testing in remote and rural areas, potential drop 
in response rate due to the addition of a citizenship question, but 
also the general growing distrust in government, and the adminis-
tration’s  plan  to  not  spend  all  their  available  resources  appro-
priated in fiscal year 2019, in fiscal year 2019. 
We are also worried about severe impact of a CR or shutdown 
heading into fiscal year 2020, without a funding anomaly for the 
Census Bureau, since playing decennial Census catch-up can be 
very challenging and extremely expensive. 
The Insights Association and Census Project also warned against 
sacrificing the ACS in any scramble for those decennial funds. A 
funding  diversion  would  reduce  the  sample  size,  preventing  the 
survey from delivering accurate data on more than 40 percent of 
U.S. counties and small towns, mostly rural. 
For now, we are grateful House Appropriations today approved 
$7.5 billion for the 2020 Census, and $8.45 billion for the Census 
Bureau overall, in line with Census stakeholders’ requests. The In-
sights Association and Census Project urge you to support the max-
imum amount of Census funding to ensure an inclusive and accu-
rate accounting of our Nation’s population, and to help to deter-
mine the fate of American business for the next decade and beyond. 
Thank you for inviting my testimony this afternoon. I encourage 
you to peruse my written entertainment for a lot more examples, 
and I look forward to answering questions.

helps the public and decision makers make informed decisions in 
Utah. 
Also, I am a member of the Census Bureau’s State Data Center 
Steering Committee, a member of the Utah Complete Count Com-
mittee, and chair of the Gardner Institute 2020 Census Technical 
Advisory Committee. 
Utah’s unique demographics and thriving economy provide in-
sight into how important the 2020 Census and other Federal data 
are to the economic success of the State. In states with shifting de-
mographics, decision makers cannot make wise and timely deci-
sions to support and build flourishing communities without the de-
cennial Census and other Federal data. 
Utah’s 3.16 million residents have distinct demographics. We are 
the youngest State with the largest average household size, but we 
are following national trends of aging and diversifying racially, eth-
nically, and culturally. 
Utah’s growth has been the fastest in the Nation since 2010. Our 
strong job growth and broad industry growth attract new people to 
our State each year. Throughout the decade, migration has become 
a more significant component of our population growth, and in the 
past 5 years, we have added over 100,000 new residents because 
of net in-migration. 
Additionally,  new  communities  have  emerged  since  2010.  In 
some areas, this means completely new investments in infrastruc-
ture, public safety, education, housing, and businesses. These areas 
have no baseline. So the 2020 Census is the first opportunity to 
learn about the population. 
Some of Utah’s rural areas have experienced population losses 
since 2010. While data from the American Community Survey pro-
vides us some insight to these changes, we need the 100 percent 
coverage provided by the 2020 Census to more fully understand the 
changing demographics of these communities. 
The 2020 Census and other Federal data are paramount to our 
State,  so  we  can  understand  the  characteristics  of  new  growth. 
Without it, we lack information about these new Utahns. 
The Utah State Data Center regularly handles requests for de-
mographic information from the public sector, private industry, and 
citizens seeking to learn more about their communities or regions. 
The data provided help with decisions about programming, invest-
ments, business location, and future planning. 
I have been surprised to meet decision makers who believe that 
decennial data are only used by and for government. I work closely 
with our statewide Complete Count Committee co-chairs to main-
tain a constant narrative that decennial Census data provides the 
baseline for myriad data sets and funding calculations across all in-
dustries and government. 
If funding calculations utilize a per capita measure or a sampling 
window based on a total population, it is highly likely decennial 
Census data is the denominator. Our director of demographic re-
search, Dr. Pamela Perlich, likes to call our team the denominator 
people. Decennial Census data is the baseline for the State and 
county-level estimates and projections we produce, and those pro-
jections are a direct input for education, healthcare, transportation,

and infrastructure planning efforts, which then turn into a signifi-
cant investment at the State and local level. 
Utahns are recognizing the importance of a complete count from 
the 2020 Census. And community leaders from non-profits, commu-
nity organizations, private industry, banking, and municipal gov-
ernment have partnered to urge State decision makers to support 
local outreach efforts this year. They emphasize the importance to 
a diverse array of interests, from economic development, to health 
and safety of Utah residents. The State, cities, counties, and the 
State library are discussing various allocations to support a com-
plete count in 2020. 
The work by Professor Reamer indicates that in fiscal year 2016, 
Utah received about $5.7 billion from Census-guided funding pro-
grams. Calculations by our Utah Governor’s Office of Management 
and Budget indicate that this was around 27 percent of the State 
budget in that time frame. These investments will pay for them-
selves quickly. 
We are reliant on a complete count of everyone in our State once, 
only once, and in the right place, to provide us with an updated 
framework  once  a  decade.  We  want  to  inform  decision  makers 
across agencies, organizations, and industries on who their con-
stituents and customers are, and plan appropriately in regions that 
may need additional assistance. 
Thank you for holding this hearing, and I look forward to a suc-
cessful 2020 Census.

STATEMENT OF NICHOLAS EBERSTADT, HENRY WENDT CHAIR 
IN POLITICAL ECONOMY, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE 
Dr. Eberstadt. Mr. Chairman, Madam Vice Chair, members of 
the  committee,  distinguished  co-panelists  and  guests,  America’s 
statistical agencies are the eyes and ears of our democracy. Wheth-
er you are a progressive, or a conservative, in favor of more govern-
ment or less, you need good data to inform your efforts to make our 
country better. 
For most of our history, the U.S. statistical system has been well 
ahead of the curve, if not a virtual wonder of the world. Recently, 
though, our Federal information systems have not fully kept up 
with the social and economic changes they should be helping us 
monitor. They are currently incapable of providing key facts and 
figures we need for confronting some of our new and pressing do-
mestic social troubles. In my book, ‘‘Men Without Work: America’s 
Invisible Crisis,’’ I tried to highlight the collapse of work for grown 
men in our country, in recent decades. 
Although  the  employment  situation  for  working-age  U.S.  men 
has been slowly improving, the latest BLS figures indicate that 
their employment rates are still just on par with the levels of 1939, 
as reported in 1940 Census, which is to say, we still have a Depres-
sion-scale problem on our hands. 
Our failure to cope more expeditiously with this problem may be 
partly related to the inadequacies of our statistical services to illu-

minate important dimensions of it. I highlighted a number of short-
comings and gaps in official information in that book I mentioned. 
Today, I wish to speak about just one of those gaps, but it is an 
enormous blind spot, and given the realities of life in our country 
today, a critical and inexplicable one. I refer to the virtual absence 
in  our  Nation’s  statistical  compendia  of  facts  and  figures  about 
America’s arrested and sentenced populations. These are large and 
growing populations, yet our government statistical systems can 
tell us almost nothing about them. 
The  explosive  surge  in  both  arrests  and  felony  sentencing  in 
modern America is a fact of life. In 2016, 91 million Americans 
were included in the Interstate Identification Index, the database 
the FBI uses to determine whether someone has a criminal record. 
That is two-fifths of the adult population. 
What do we know about this huge contingent of people? Almost 
nothing. Age, sex, ethnicity, living arrangements, family situation, 
income, educational profile, health status, and all the rest of the 
data the Federal Government collects on our population are not 
cross-referenced here. 
And the situation is even worse concerning the American felon 
population. It is not just that the government provides no informa-
tion on the social, economic, or health conditions of these men and 
women. Astonishing as this may sound, the statistical system does 
not even offer an estimate for the total size of the population of 
Americans who have a felony conviction in their background. 
Academic researchers have attempted a demographic reconstruc-
tion, though. According to their estimates, this convicted population 
shot up from under 2 million persons in 1948, to nearly 20 million 
in 2010. By those numbers, roughly one in 12 American adults had 
a felony conviction in 2010, one in eight adult men. That was 2010. 
Rough calculations suggest the total population with a felony con-
viction in America today might equal or exceed 24 million. 
We hear a lot about mass incarceration. Over 2 million persons 
in  America  are  in  correctional  facilities  today.  Usually  missing 
from the conversation about mass incarceration, however, is any 
recognition that these imprisoned Americans may represent less 
than one-tenth of the total population of felony convicts. 
Today, 20 million or more Americans not behind bars may have 
a felony conviction in their past. This immense population is effec-
tively, statistically invisible.  The Census Bureau,  the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, the Centers for Disease Control, none can tell us 
practically anything about conditions of life for these tens of mil-
lions of Americans in our society. 
Needless to say, evidence-based policies to help reintegrate ex- 
cons and ex-felons back into the labor force and into families and 
into societies require evidence in the first place. 
We have a chance to end this statistical darkness. Including just 
one or two questions on criminal justice system history in the ACS 
could end this statistical darkness, and linked administrative data 
offer another avenue for redressing this darkness, with much great-
er speed and at far lower cost. 
For  obvious  reasons,  approaches  to  reentry  and  rehabilitation 
today remain largely anecdotal. It is past time to take the steps

necessary to begin wresting our approaches to public policy in this 
realm on facts. 
Thank you, Madam Vice Chair and Chairman. I would like also, 
if I could, to add some additional materials to the record with your 
permission. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Absolutely. 
[The prepared statement of Dr. Eberstadt appears in the Submis-
sions for the Record on page 48.] 
Thank you all for your testimony, and we appreciate your re-
search and all your work in the area. 
I would like to ask Mr. Fienberg about the addition of the citi-
zenship question to the Census, and the effect that this will have 
on the accuracy of the data. We heard from all of you the impor-
tance of having accurate data, but we had a case recently that 
went all the way to the Supreme Court. Judge Furman in New 
York ruled that the addition was frivolous, and a tremendous mis-
take, and would lead to an undercount. Six former heads of the 
Census  Bureau,  both  Republican  and  Democratic,  signed  letters 
and spoke out that adding the citizenship question would result in 
an undercount. 
And we know how much businesses depend on this. The profes-
sionals at the Census Bureau also came out and spoke out against 
adding this question and said that it would result in an inaccurate 
count, inaccurate data, for the Census—for the 2020 Census. And 
in preparing for this, we spoke to Maurine Haver, a constituent of 
mine, who is President and CEO of Haver Analytics. Haver is the 
premier provider of time series data for the global strategy and re-
search  community  and  maintains  over  200-plus  databases  from 
over 1,000 government and private sources that rely on Census 
data.  She  is  concerned  the  citizenship  question  may  reduce  the 
quality of the Census data. Reams of professionals have joined her 
in this decision. And, Mr. Fienberg, do you and the businesses you 
have worked with share her concerns about the data accuracy of 
the 2020 Census? 
Mr. Fienberg. I do. I should say, I am commenting in the capac-
ity with the Insights Association hat on, rather than—the Census 
Project doesn’t have a position on the citizenship question. The In-
sights Association does. We joined an amicus brief with a lot of 
other businesses to the Supreme Court case on this issue. And we 
do have a great concern. 
I can’t tell you with any great certainty what the impact will be 
on a numbers basis. I don’t think we have good enough data to be 
able to say, and that is part of the problem that we have going into 
this.  But  there  is  enough  data  to  be  able  to,  you  know,  justify 
that—expect there will be a significant drop in the self-response 
rate  for  the  decennial,  which  is  the  people  actually  responding 
without us spending a significant amount of time and money to get 
them to respond. 
So even that alone, you can expect a significant increase in, you 
know, the amount of money that is going to have to go towards 
nonresponse follow-up, which is the going door to door to get people 
to respond. And even if we are able to get the 100 percent accuracy 
at that point, you know, that would still cost us an absolute fortune 
in nonresponse follow-up.

But I don’t think we are going to be able to achieve that, because 
there will be some people that will still be deterred from respond-
ing, based on the concerns about the citizenship question. That will 
trickle down into the data. Just as an example, I cited for the 
media measurement among my members to be able to accurately 
measure the audience for advertising and programming among the 
Asian immigrants, or the Hispanic population, is going to drive ad-
vertising rates all over the map, and it is going to make everyone’s 
spending in this area much less accurate, and there will be a lot 
of wasted resources. 
Vice Chair Maloney. There are also—people feel that there will 
be an undercount based on the political climate of fear, and that 
possibly that has increased the likelihood of an undercount. Dr. 
Reamer, I would like to ask you about that. In fact, there was a 
hearing yesterday with the Secretary of HUD, and he said that 
their policy would be to deport anyone in public housing and re-
move them from public housing if they were undocumented. Yet 
their children are citizens. As you know, if you have a child in 
America, they are considered an American citizen. 
So we could be facing a situation where parents could be leaving 
the country, but the children are staying here, and how are we 
going to take care of these children, with the separation of the fam-
ilies? So when you read about this type of crackdown, it might have 
the effect on people of not wanting to answer the citizenship ques-
tion, therefore, not responding to the Census. 
Do you think the climate for the 2020 decennial Census, which 
many have characterized as a climate of fear and uncertainty, pre-
sents a greater risk that we may see an undercount in 2020, and 
how do you think that would affect American businesses? And from 
all of your testimony, you cited the extent to which American busi-
nesses and the private sector rely on the Census data. 
Dr.  Reamer.  The  Census  Bureau’s  own  research  shows  that 
there is a climate of fear. They have held focus groups where peo-
ple run out of the room when they are asked the citizenship ques-
tion. The heart of the Census research that was used in the citizen-
ship case, that both the plaintiffs and the defendants used, was the 
Census Bureau’s estimate that the nonresponse rate for households 
with noncitizens would be 5.8 percent less than the response for 
households with citizens. The implications of that are that a lot of 
people would be missed. As Howard says, there is nonresponse fol-
low-up. Maybe in 2010, 65 percent of the people mailed back their 
form. This time they will have—— 
Vice Chair Maloney. So that would be around 6 million people, 
the 5.8? 
Dr. Reamer. Yes. 
Vice Chair Maloney. That is a lot. 
Dr. Reamer. And the Census Bureau then has to find these peo-
ple, and it doesn’t always succeed. It either finds them and get the 
information, or it doesn’t find them. If it knows they are there, it 
imputes  what  it  thinks  the  characteristics  are,  which  may  be 
wrong.  So  Howard’s  members  may  be—say,  well,  there  is  this 
many Hispanics in this community, but, in fact, it is 10 percent 
less or 10 percent more.

And also, the Census Bureau misses people that they don’t even 
know they miss. So—— 
Vice Chair Maloney. Regretfully, my time is up. 
And so I now recognize the Chairman, Mr. Lee, for his 5 minutes 
or 6 minutes because I went over. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you very much, Vice Chair Maloney. 
Ms. Bateman, I would like to start with you, if we could. As I 
mentioned in my opening statement, the Census Bureau is really 
good at collecting a lot of information, but none of the Census Bu-
reau surveys that I am aware of has any measures for things like 
loneliness, happiness, the availability of sources of emotional sup-
port, nor do they, to my knowledge, have any information on the 
availability  of  public  amenities,  access  to  public  parks,  play-
grounds, libraries, and so forth. And those are things that are often 
at least associated with high levels of community involvement. 
First, do you believe that the addition of survey questions ad-
dressing some of these topics could help researchers better under-
stand the health of civil society? 
Ms. Bateman. They could provide insight, as long as people un-
derstand the concepts. I think there would have to be some expla-
nation of what you are looking for. And I know that this is a topic 
that is coming up all over the globe. So you could probably find ex-
isting formats and surveys that could help provide guidance, but it 
would be an interesting thing to look into. 
Chairman Lee. It certainly—even though it is difficult to meas-
ure,  it  is  certainly  not  impossible  to  measure,  right?  There  are 
ways you could devise questions that could at least allow us to get 
access to some of this information? 
Ms. Bateman. Other countries are definitely looking into this. 
Chairman Lee. Are there any other topics that you would sug-
gest trying to address in order to assess the health of our civil in-
stitutions or the health of civil society? 
Ms. Bateman. That is a big question. I think if you could have 
a survey that people felt safe—and they trusted the institution in 
the first place—to respond, you could extrapolate and add more 
questions,  touching  on  that  type  of  topic,  but  it  would  require 
trust—— 
Chairman Lee. Sure. 
Ms. Bateman [continuing]. In the institution. 
Chairman Lee. Yeah, sure. They have got to have trust in the 
institution. If they don’t trust, then you are not going to get as 
much of a response. But high response rates alone, if you are not 
asking the right data, won’t give you that. 
It  gives  me  some  comfort  to  know  that  in  other  parts  of  the 
world, they track such information. So we know it is not impos-
sible. We also know that it is desirable, and that there are good 
things that could come from it. Sometimes we fail adequately to ap-
preciate the impact our laws might have on relationships, on the— 
what brings people together as families, as neighborhoods, as com-
munities, as fellow congregants and so forth. 
Mr. Eberstadt, I would like to ask you a couple questions if I 
could. We found a limited number of relevant survey questions that 
deal with social capital. As we have undertaken the Social Capital 
Project  through  the  Joint  Economic  Committee,  we  have  looked

high and low for this. We haven’t found a whole lot of it. And I 
think much of your work touches on things that are related to 
this—the  web  of  relationships  that  connect  people  together.  We 
have, at the family level, at the community level, represent really, 
I think, what are people’s best chances of succeeding in life, espe-
cially their best chances of thriving. 
What, if anything, would you recommend to be added to the Cen-
sus Bureau surveys in order to give us a more accurate and ful-
some view of associational life in America? 
Dr. Eberstadt. Senator, first and foremost, a salute to you and 
your committee for investigating this important question of social 
capital. I think your team has done great work, very promising 
work so far. I can mention one item in particular, which I believe 
you are currently prohibited from inquiring about, and this is the 
religious  adherence,  or  religious  devotion  of  American  citizens. 
Since 1976, the Census Bureau has been prohibited from asking 
such questions. And that has been taken, I think, broadly, as best 
practice, by all other statistical organizations. 
Since secular approaches and religiosity seem to have some bear-
ing  on  social  capital,  this  would,  I  think,  be  a  reasonable,  and 
maybe a very interesting question to include. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you. Along with that, what do you think 
we ought to be asking about in terms of people’s criminal records? 
The fact that, as much of your research indicates, there is a high 
connection between someone’s criminal background, whether they 
have been on probation, parole, supervised release, or served time 
in prison, or all of the above, should we be asking more about that, 
and what could that tell us? 
Dr. Eberstadt. Sir, I think the most expeditious and inexpen-
sive way of casting light in this area would be to link up existing 
administrative data with something like the Current Population 
Survey, the monthly job report data. This could be done by the 
Census Bureau and other statistical U.S. authorities, paying atten-
tion to confidentiality and privacy of the individuals in question. 
This would be able to show, at least for a start, what sorts of pat-
terns we see in the sentenced population currently on probation or 
on parole, with respect to employment, income, family situation, 
and the CPS questions. It would probably take about 3 weeks to 
get information on those 5- or 6 million persons. 
Questions for the ACS, I think, would have to be tested very 
carefully and prepared very carefully, since this is such a sensitive 
and personal area of life, but if they could be adequately tested and 
rolled out, I think this would help to illuminate this darkness I was 
describing. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you. That is very helpful. 
Thank you, Vice Chair Maloney. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you so much. 
And Representative Heck. 
Representative Heck. Thank you, Madam Vice Chair. 
Dr. Reamer, listening with interest to a lot of the provocative 
dialogue here about adding additional questions for deeper infor-
mation, but I want to step back and make sure I have this thing 
in correct perspective. As I read the Constitution, as I understand

it, is not the first and foremost objective of the Census to get an 
accurate count on the number of noses in America? 
Dr. Reamer. Yes. 
Representative Heck. Thank you. I have been doing a—well, 
and anything that would detract from that would, therefore—— 
Dr. Reamer. Yes. And if I could insert—and I am happy to talk 
to members and staff afterwards—I have a bunch of ideas for how 
to  collect  social  capital  and  the  population  characteristics  that 
would not involve adding questions to the Census. 
Representative Heck. So I have been doing a fairly deep dive 
in the last few years on the issue of the crisis of soaring housing 
prices and the shortage of houses, housing units available in Amer-
ica.  We  have  compiled,  through  our  task  force,  a  report  called 
‘‘Missing Millions of Homes.’’ And for our conclusion that we are 
missing millions of homes, we utilized a lot of Census data, housing 
vacancy survey, rental vacancy rate, home ownership rate, a joint 
HUD/Census effort on American Housing Survey, a building permit 
survey done by Census, and I could go on and on. 
I think, Mr. Fienberg, I want to direct this to you. We know that 
we are millions of homes short based on this data. But here is what 
we also know, which is that over the course of the last decade, 
there has been fairly flat funding for our efforts to collect this kind 
of data. I am asking you this because you made such a point of the 
importance to have robust funding for a totally accurate count. 
And I guess I want to ask you, as it relates to certain public pol-
icy challenges and social problems, like the lack of housing units 
available, to what degree, even if you could describe this quali-
tatively, is our ability to understand these challenges, hampered by 
a shortage of funding and complete accuracy? 
Mr. Fienberg. I don’t know how much funding is necessary for 
100 percent accuracy. I wish I did. That would be great to be able 
to tell you exactly—— 
Representative Heck. Are we there? 
Mr. Fienberg. No. I think we are—part of the problem is that 
Congress has to deal with a 10-year budget window for the decen-
nial Census, and it is very difficult for Congress to deal with that 
10-year window when you are going year to year, and the Census 
Bureau starts out at the beginning of a decennial cycle at very lit-
tle money, and then suddenly the last couple of years is spending 
in many billions of dollars and required to pull it off. 
Representative Heck. Well, would you—Mr. Fienberg, would 
you say that our ability to deal with these problems is, in some 
fashion, affected, if not curtailed, by an absence of having as accu-
rate data as is reasonably possible? 
Mr. Fienberg. Absolutely. 
Representative Heck. And this would include housing? 
Mr. Fienberg. Oh, definitely, yes. In fact, I would guide you to-
wards a letter—a letter I referenced from the National Association 
of Realtors on how they use housing data to try to keep on top of 
the need for housing and the housing markets. And there is also 
extensive work done by the National Association of Home Builders 
using Census data in trying to, again, impute into where housing 
is and where it should be.

Representative Heck. Ergo, the need to provide adequate fund-
ing. 
Mr. Fienberg. Absolutely. 
Representative Heck. So I want to shift to another—kind of 
parallel subject. One of the most fundamental and essential man-
dates that we have set for ourselves, I think, would be to maintain 
an economy and a state of maximum employment. And as a matter 
of fact, that is a statutory mandate of the Federal Reserve, price 
stability and full employment. Yet we can’t seem to define ‘‘full em-
ployment’’ in statistical terms, or if we can, we can’t measure it. 
I know this because we are currently at 3.6 percent unemployment, 
and the Fed has said full employment is 4.3 percent unemploy-
ment. 
And, obviously, we are well past their definition of full employ-
ment, and yet—unless somebody informs me otherwise—the Phil-
lips  curve  has  been  repealed,  we  still  are  seeing  modest  wage 
growth, and we are still adding 150- to 250,000 jobs a month. So 
we are clearly not at full employment. 
I am trying to sort out, is that because we are so far past the 
beginning of the decade that our data is fading, the accuracy of it? 
Is it because we haven’t had adequate funding? But clearly, there 
is a disconnect here. You are looking at one another, like, not me, 
not me. Ms. Bateman, you, what accounts for this? Why is it that 
we are so far past the full employment data, or target that they 
have set, and yet we are adding jobs—Dr. Reamer has an answer. 
Thank you, sir. 
Dr. Reamer. I don’t know if it is an answer. I don’t think it is 
a problem with the data. I think labor force participation rates are 
low historically. So what is happening is that additional people are 
joining the labor force. I think it is a question about, why is it that 
unemployment is so low, and yet inflation has not taken off. And 
jobs are added—— 
Representative Heck.  You  are  saying  the  Philips  curve  has 
been repealed? 
Dr. Reamer. Well, it may have been amended in—— 
Representative Heck. God wrote the Phillips curve, Dr. Ream-
er. 
Dr. Reamer. So I think it is—it is a research question that it 
is—it is not an issue with the age of the data. It is an issue with 
the dynamics of the workforce, and back to adequate funding, the 
Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  is  dying  for  adequate  funding.  They 
have  been  flatlined  by  Congress  for  the  last  10  years.  So  their 
budget is 15 to 20 percent below what it was in 2010. 
Representative Heck. I think you have made my point. 
I am out of time. I yield back. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you. 
Representative Schweikert. 
Representative Schweikert. Thank you, Madam Vice Chair. 
Actually,  to  Mr.  Heck,  my  understanding,  is  there  an  entire 
group—of Ph.D. economists—and demographers over at the Fed ac-
tually working on Phillips curve? Do you have to actually add in 
a conceptual shock absorber for potential labor force participation 
that we had sort of written out? You know, companies now being 
willing to hire felons, others, but also impacts of technology, chang-

ing productivity and other things. So there is always noise in the 
data. 
I have a dozen things here, and I want to disclose in a previous 
life, I lived in TIGER files. 
For those of us from Utah, Texas, Arizona, where we have quick-
ly growing, substantial population movements and shifts, I under-
stand the 10-year Census with as many questions as possible for 
businesses and economic decision making. But for communities like 
mine, we look dramatically different than we did 10 years ago, if 
every day I am getting 3, 400 new residents in my State. If we do 
the 10-year Census, is there an elegant way to start doing what a 
lot of my businesses, my universities, even my State government 
is trying to look at, and that is ways to almost crowd-source much 
more living data? 
And if that makes sense, you know, how do we look at every day, 
how many building permits, birth rates, deaths, everything else? 
But you also actually even start to look into how many gallons of 
fuel sold, how many this, how many that. Are we basically still liv-
ing in a data-design model that is decades out of date? And you 
think about all—everything from social indicators, of how many 
people signed up for SNAP this week, to how many people we be-
lieve, you know, picked up a job, or this and that. There has got 
to be a way that, when I am looking at, you know, my community, 
I am not looking at data that is 10 years old. 
And,  I  mean,  we  are  living  in  a  time  where  we  are  walking 
around with super computers. I am frustrated, and somewhere in 
here, there may actually be—and forgive my heresy—a data-mod-
eling  opportunity  between  government,  university,  Census,  busi-
ness, to build us a model. 
And why this is so important is, what I want to know is what 
I am seeing in the TIGER files—excuse me—in the U6 data real? 
Am I really seeing those with personal issues moving into the labor 
force? Am I really seeing millennial women moving in, but not mil-
lennial males? And is that living data the type of thing we could 
also be, as we are doing policy every day, be reacting to? In some 
ways—I know I don’t have a classic demographer on the panel, but 
let’s do a little bouncing. Being from sort of the university mecha-
nism, is what I am speaking heresy? 
Ms. Bateman. I don’t know that it is heresy, but our team would 
advocate to look to your research universities. Our team produces 
an annual update to estimates and population projections and also 
looks at housing units in the State. We have a database where all 
the local cities report their building permits to our database. So we 
have these ongoing partnerships with the community to keep an 
up-to-date data set. 
Representative Schweikert. Okay. Dr. Eberstadt. 
Dr. Eberstadt. Sir, what you say is music to my ears. I love to 
hear that. 
Representative Schweikert. I am the least musical person you 
are ever going to meet. 
Dr. Eberstadt. Well, let me give it a try. 
Representative  Schweikert.  And  I  actually  have  read  your 
books.

Dr. Eberstadt. Big data, linked administrative data, and other 
Census data which are indispensable, all wonderful opportunities. 
With respect to U6 and to the Phillips curve, the Humphrey-Haw-
kins Act was written at a time when working age men were ei-
ther—— 
Representative Schweikert. I think of us not going there. I 
know exactly where you are going, and actually, I am not a big 
data person. I am more of a—I have now moved to crowd source 
data. I actually believe big data gets old very fast. Living data is 
more useful. 
Dr. Reamer. 
Dr. Reamer. Right. Three points. One is the Census Bureau pro-
duces annual population estimates that are very good. If the Cen-
sus is accurate, the bulk of the update annual is based on records, 
births, deaths and tax forms where people move from one year to 
another. So in terms of the actual head count, it is pretty good. 
I think what would be helpful is, one, getting a contingent work 
supplement on the CPS so you understand that aspect of the work-
force. 
And  secondly,  Vice  Chair  Maloney  mentioned  Maurine  Haver. 
She and I are working to create the third annual conference that 
brings together statistical agencies with Amazon and Uber. 
Representative Schweikert. Something like that I would love 
for—please forgive me, Vice Chair Maloney. Just one quick. 
Being someone who also spent a bunch of time bathing in the 
community survey, I actually have to disagree with you on just 
something. I think  I actually distrust the government. There  is 
some academic research out there that that was a bigger fragility 
in return rates than citizenship or all the other things that were 
being sort of discussed and tested. 
So we may actually—I know one is a political hot potato and fits 
the, you know, us against them. We may actually have a whole cul-
tural thing we have to work through because that was one of the 
real problems on the community survey, research. 
So with that, I yield back. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you. And we have been joined by 
Representative Beyer from Virginia. 
Thank you for being here. 
Representative Beyer. This is my first time in this room find-
ing the button. Thank you very much for being here. 
First, Dr. Reamer, my daughter just graduated with her MPA 
from G.W. Friday morning. 
Dr. Reamer. Congratulations. 
Representative  Beyer.  Thank  you.  Thank  you.  She  seems 
thrilled to have it. Now all she needs is a job, and things will be 
good. 
Dr.  Reamer.  My  mother  graduated  from  the  University  of 
Washington. 
Representative Beyer. Wow. The one degree of separation. 
And I really want to thank you all for talking to us about the 
business uses of the Census data. When I opened a Land Rover 
dealership 22 years ago, we went months without selling a Range 
Rover until I turned to the Census data and figured out where our 
customers lived, where our potential customers lived, and all of a

sudden, it worked out really well. And the biggest concern that we 
have in my district right now, throughout Northern Virginia, is the 
fear of undercounting. 
And so we obviously have a sadly divisive political climate. The 
meeting at the White House this morning is the latest example. 
Has that dampened business’ willingness to advocate for the Cen-
sus  and  participate  in  Census  research  and  all  the  controversy 
over,  you  know,  for  example,  the  citizenship  question?  Or  just 
the—— 
Vice Chair Maloney. Will the gentleman yield for 2 seconds? 
Representative Beyer. Yes. 
Vice Chair Maloney. You are raising a really important point. 
We had difficulty getting business representatives to come which 
we have never had before. We had the Chamber of Commerce in 
prior years. 
Nielsen wrote a big report, and yet they said they didn’t want 
to come because of the divisions and the fight over the citizenship 
question and the divisions between Congress. So that is a very im-
portant point that you raise. 
Thank you for raising it. 
Representative Beyer. From the positions that you have, have 
you seen any reluctance on the part of businesses to be part of 
this? 
Mr. Fienberg. I have. Sorry. Certainly  we are  used  to a  lot 
greater participation from the business community and advocacy 
for the Census. In the case that I am not—things I am not directly 
involved in, but in the preparation for the decennial, businesses 
play a huge role in helping to get out the count, getting people in-
volved, making sure that both people, companies’ employees and 
their customers are going to be getting out know that the decennial 
Census is coming, making sure that they are going to self respond. 
It is hugely important. A lot of them are not getting involved this 
time around. A lot of them have a little bit hesitancy, showing hesi-
tancy in getting involved in presentation and advocacy, you know, 
on all sides because of the citizenship question. And that is not a 
specific thing saying that they are opposed to the citizenship ques-
tion. I think the average business—and most businesses don’t have 
a position on it one way or the other. They are risk averse and 
don’t want to be involved in a political controversy, period. 
So yeah. There are some companies that will care deeply about 
it because of the impact on the data that they are going to rely on, 
but most are more concerned about being involved in the political 
controversy and being seen as taking a side on a political issue. 
Representative Beyer. So, I don’t know if this is Ms. Bateman 
or Mr. Fienberg, I know you have been pressing for full funding of 
the Census, but one of the things that has concerned me is the dra-
matic reduction in the number of people that are intended to be 
hired from the 2010 Census, and I know that what I read is that 
supposedly the technology is so much better that we don’t need to 
have all those people working the streets. 
But do you have concerns that there aren’t going to be enough 
human beings knocking on doors for the people that didn’t mail it 
in or go online? 
Ms. Bateman.

Ms. Bateman. Yes. I know, especially in Utah, we do have very 
low unemployment, and that wasn’t the case in 2010. And so spe-
cifically in our case, I know that our partnership specialists and 
partnership team is trying to start very early to try to get people 
on board and trying to reach out to different groups than they had 
in the past, trying to figure out jobs where people might have more 
flexible hours that they could find—the opportunity for a second job 
would be appealing. But I know that our low unemployment in 
Utah is definitely a concern. 
Mr. Fienberg. And if I recall correctly, there was supposed to 
be—according to the Census bureau, they were going to be aiming 
for 1,500 partnerships staff that they are going to be sending out 
in the field. According to the GAO, they are not likely to hit that 
this year in terms of their hiring. You need to hire them now. 
And admittedly, in 2010, I believe they were closer to 4,000 part-
nership staff, and it is a huge deal in a very large country, espe-
cially as you move west in the country when going door to door and 
making  contact  with  people  in  remote  areas  is  extremely  com-
plicated. 
And again, in a condition where the government is not trusted, 
you need to have people out in the field setting up relationships 
with  the  local  church,  with  local  community  groups,  with  local 
trusted entities to make sure that there is someone other than just 
the government knocking on the door saying they are there to help. 
Representative Beyer. Dr. Reamer, I only have a couple of sec-
onds  left,  but  I  am  fascinated  by  not  just  big  data  but  by  the 
progress we made on machine learning and deep analytics. Will 
this Census be able to be used in very different, more important 
ways because of that evolution? 
Dr. Reamer. I think so. Both coming in and going out, right, 
that kind of machine learning and high tech computing will be 
used to produce a more accurate Census. And then going out, the 
capacity to match for the Census Bureau, to get administrative 
records, to get private sector records, match them up with Census 
records and do modeling, I think, is a new frontier for us. 
Representative Beyer. Thank you very much. 
Madam Chair, I yield back. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Thank you very much. 
Representative Marchant. Thank you. 
Representative Marchant. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
I am from a very high growth district and State and from a back-
ground of being a mayor and in the State legislature, so we have 
depended on the Census Bureau giving us more frequent updates 
than every 10 years. So that data we rely on much more than we 
do the every 10-year data except for the reproportionment of our 
Congressional seats and then the funding issue. 
My question to you is after all of the public policy is taken into 
consideration and the Census is actually done, and you go through 
this very delicate process at the end of the Census where you have 
this undercount adjustment that takes place, and I would like to 
know your opinion of how much the undercount adjustment actu-
ally erodes some of the information that is in the report itself. 
And if you have a citizenship question which we are concerned 
about in Texas as well because we want every nose counted, period,

because so much of our funding for our cities and counties, school 
districts depends on it, and of course, the number of seats we have 
in Congress depends on it. 
Will  there  be  an  adjustment  to  the  Census,  in  your  opinion, 
based on a question that they think or the general opinion is that 
there is a possibility that this question could suppress the number. 
Will  there  been  an  adjustment  for  the  undercount  for  the 
undercount, or will there just be a general readjustment of the defi-
nition of undercount? 
And I know that is a really—a question that doesn’t get asked 
very often, but I think that this may be the first time in many, 
many decades that the undercount may be one of the most political 
things that happens as a result of this Census. You can take a stab 
at it. 
Dr. Reamer. Congressman, my understanding is that there is no 
adjustment. So whatever the count is, that is the count, and that 
was a Supreme Court ruling of 20 years ago. Because in the 1990s, 
the Clinton administration proposed to adjust because in 1990, 5 
out of 100 African Americans and 5 out of 100 Hispanics were 
missed, so that was the proposal. And the Supreme Court ruled no, 
you have to use the actual count, so there is no adjustment of the 
count. The count is the count. 
Representative Marchant. Yes. 
Dr. Reamer. But after the count is what is called a post enu-
meration survey—— 
Representative Marchant. Yeah. 
Dr. Reamer [continuing]. Which tries to measure Census cov-
erage. In other words, Census goes back the year after it went into 
the field and said how well did we do? And so you can go online. 
I am happy to you give you the web address. For the Nation, for 
every  State,  for  every  county  above  100,000  or  200,000  people, 
there is an estimate of Census coverage measurement. 
How many people were accurately counted? There are a lot of du-
plications, 3 out of 100 people are counted twice. Three out of 100 
people are missed. So they cancel each other out. There is a one- 
page CCM chart for the counties in the Dallas area, or wherever, 
for that. 
And the same thing will happen in 2020, so people can look and 
see how well did the Census Bureau do? There is a breakout for 
the Nation by race, ethnicity, age. So they do a retrospective anal-
ysis, but the count itself is not adjusted. 
Representative Marchant. But in the State legislatures and 
their process of redistricting those States that have that process, 
they wait for that information to come out many times to seriously 
get down to the actual drawing. 
And  so  my  question  is,  to  reiterate,  Texas,  the  fast  growing 
States,  want  the  most  accurate  Census.  They  want  every  nose 
counted. I know that Utah does and Texas does. So I am interested 
in that policy question. 
I am also interested in Mr. Eberstadt’s point about felons. Now, 
your definition is not felon. Your definition is someone that has ex-
perience with the criminal justice system. 
Dr. Eberstadt. Yes, sir. I referred to two separate populations.

accessed through the FBI or through police authorities. That is one 
group. 
The second group is people who at some point in their life history 
have been convicted of a felony, of a serious crime, punishable by 
a year or more in prison. 
Representative  Marchant.  I  am  over  my  time,  but  do  you 
think there is a possibility that if a question is put on there that 
is not asked properly, it could actually have an effect on who is 
willing to respond? 
Dr. Eberstadt. Yes, sir. Absolutely. It has to be. 
Representative Marchant. Yeah. Thank you. 
Vice Chair Maloney. Congresswoman Beatty. 
Representative  Beatty.  Thank  you,  Ranking  Member,  and 
thank my colleague over there. It was a perfect segue for me to not 
just ask you, Dr. Eberstadt, but the rest of the panel. I want to 
take special note to—I would be very interested in your testimony 
and to emphasize for the record that some of the information pre-
sented in your written testimony, especially the chart we have, in-
dicated that black men who are out of the labor workforce at a 
higher rate than their counterparts, even though maybe they had 
a lower interaction with the criminal justice center may be where 
my colleague was going, but you were very specific here. I suggest 
that this might also be an economic issue worthy of a fuller exam-
ination beyond the Census for this body to take a look at since we 
are talking about economic development. 
But I would like to focus more on your position that we need 
more information about persons with a criminal history. So I would 
like to pose the question to the entire panel. Do you have concerns 
that the inclusion of a question about a person’s possible criminal 
history might affect, one, participation of the Census, or the accu-
racy of the data? 
Dr. Eberstadt. Ma’am, it is a critical question, and it is a very 
sensitive question that one would be asking people. It would have 
to be tested very carefully. It would have to be rolled out in a very 
careful way so as to ensure that this did not adversely affect par-
ticipation in the ACS or in other surveys where it might be asked. 
We have a way of test piloting this investigation that wouldn’t 
have any effect on nonresponse rates, and that would be by linking 
up existing administrative data on probation and parole, with prop-
er privacy and confidentiality controls, to the existing data coming 
out of our monthly jobs report, out of our current population sur-
vey. 
That way all of the data would come from administrative sources 
already, and it would be possible to get a sense of how much of an 
impact sentencing has. 
Representative  Beatty.  Would  anybody  else  like  to  make  a 
comment, and maybe while you are thinking, I want to go to you, 
Mr.—is it Finberg? 
Mr. Fienberg. Fienberg. 
Representative Beatty. Fienberg. Research shows us that ask-
ing stigmatizing and sensitive questions such as citizenship status 
might lead us to reduced rates of some community wanting to fully 
and fairly and accurately be counted in a Census. So I am con-
cerned  about  the  unprecedented  politicizing  of  the  2020  citizen

Census if such citizenship questions are the first step down a very 
troubling path. 
Like, how would it affect the integrity of the Census and the Fed-
eral statistics based on the Census if we were to ask questions that 
residents might not want to answer fully or may be fearful that re-
sponding, for example, have you ever been a victim of domestic vio-
lence? Have you ever been incarcerated? How would that effect a 
business participation in the Census, and that is you and then any-
one else quickly because we only have a minute. 
Mr. Fienberg. I am not sure about business participation spe-
cifically. I know certainly a lot of different questions they do carry 
a stigma and concern for folks. I think the idea of putting, I think, 
those kind of questions on the decennial is questionable at best be-
cause are you trying to focus just on the head count. But certainly 
those questions are asked across a lot of Federal surveys. And to 
Dr. Eberstadt’s point, administrative data is a very good way to 
start in trying to get a better picture on a lot of those topics. 
Representative Beatty. Well, and let me tell you why I say not 
only businesses. You know the reasons that the Census are used. 
It was articulated before. It is for the reapportionment board in 
drawing the lines. It is for how Federal dollars come back into the 
community.  There  is  a  whole  host  of  reasons,  and  so  maybe  I 
should do a little cultural thing here. 
I can tell you coming up there were days when the person would 
come along and ask very personal questions. My father would not 
answer them because he felt that it was going to have some type 
of indication with the IRS, or somebody was going to come and 
start doing another investigation. 
I don’t really believe in this wonderful America that we live in 
that things have changed so much as we still have not been able 
to reform immigration reform. We still need to reform our criminal 
justice system. 
So I know my time has run out, but I think we need to take a 
look at this. I think we are kidding ourselves if we think because 
there have been Federal studies that people are going to open their 
doors automatically to give the answers you want. 
Thank you, Vice Chair. 
Vice Chair Maloney. I want to thank all of my colleagues for 
participating  today  and  our  distinguished  panel  of  expert  testi-
mony. 
And as we have heard this afternoon, businesses, researchers, 
policymakers, and communities across the country count on a fair 
and accurate Census to make a broad range of economic and stra-
tegic decisions. We must do everything possible to ensure that the 
2020 Census is accurate. 
The record will remain open for 7 business days for any member 
who wishes to submit a statement or additional questions. 
This hearing is adjourned. 
Thank you all very much. Thank you.

PREPAREDSTATEMENTOFHON. CAROLYNB. MALONEY, VICECHAIR, JOINT 
ECONOMICCOMMITTEE 
I am pleased to hold this hearing examining the many economic uses of Census 
and other Federal data, particularly by U.S. businesses. 
Census data is the only source of objective and comprehensive data about the Na-
tion’s demographic characteristics down to the neighborhood-level. 
The decennial Census provides the foundation for other Federal surveys, including 
the American Community Survey. The ACS tracks social, demographic, economic 
and housing data, including educational attainment, income and earnings, employ-
ment status and housing value. 
Census data are an essential building block or benchmark for most nationally rep-
resentative surveys—public and private, helping us to understand the economy, our 
workforce and opportunities for growth. 
GENERALBUSINESSUSEOFCENSUSDATA 
Businesses use Census data to make economic and strategic decisions that deter-
mine the flow of almost $4 trillion in annual private investment. 
They use it to decide where to locate or expand operations and where to open new 
stores and distribution centers. Even what products to sell in which stores. It affects 
where and how advertisers spend their dollars. 
When businesses plot their strategies, they look at Census data to understand the 
skills of the workforce and the characteristics of potential customers. 
BUSINESSEXAMPLES—LARGECORPORATIONS 
Let’s take a few examples. 
David Kenny, the CEO of Nielsen, in a recent New York Times op-ed, described 
how businesses rely on Census data to make a broad range of strategic decisions. 
The Census is used to identify where, for example, to put power lines, cell towers 
and hospitals. 
Target told us that the U.S. Census is one of many resources that it uses to better 
understand the communities where they do business. 
BUSINESSEXAMPLES—REGIONALPLANNING 
In the 7 Rivers region, which includes southwest Wisconsin, southeast Minnesota 
and northeast Iowa, hundreds of businesses and community leaders are using Cen-
sus-based data to craft strategies to fill jobs and boost labor force participation. 
It starts with using data to understand who is unemployed, who has left the labor 
force, how much education have they attained. How do local workers compare to 
others nationwide? Are they younger, older, more likely to be male or female? 
The strategies that emerged from a careful analysis of the data are varied. One 
approach is to expand child care to make it more attractive for women with young 
children to enter the labor market. 
The 7 Rivers Alliance is just one example. Every day, companies across the coun-
try make decisions based on Census data to chart their future. 
FEDERALPOLICY 
The decennial Census is used to apportion representation in the U.S. House of 
Representatives and to determine allocation of Federal funds. Hundreds of billions 
in Federal dollars and fair political representation are on the table. 
Where we build roads, bridges, schools and other core infrastructure is based on 
Federal data. 
How we target funds to address cancer, obesity and other health challenges de-
pends on the Census. 
ITHASBEENPOLITICIZED 
Unfortunately, the 2020 Census has been politicized through the citizenship ques-
tion. Immigrant communities, already skeptical of the Federal Government, are re-
luctant to take part in a survey they believe could be used against them, jeopard-
izing their status. 
A recent study at Harvard found that the citizenship question could lead to 6 mil-
lion Hispanics missing from the count. 
That means Hispanics would be underrepresented in Congress and would receive 
less in Federal dollars. 
It means businesses would not get accurate data about the role Latinos play in 
the U.S. economy.

It means the 2020 Census would not provide a fair and accurate count. 
The point of the Census is to get a full count of the population. Any proposal that 
would limit or discourage participation would run counter to this very objective. 
This would undermine the integrity of the Census data, inflicting substantial 
harm on businesses and others that depend on accurate data. And it would under-
mine the right of every American to be represented. 
CONCLUSION 
Getting the count wrong would be costly with far-reaching effects on nearly every 
segment of the population and on nearly every industry in our economy. 
We would be misallocating resources through misguided business investments and 
poorly targeted government expenditures. 
We would be using flawed data as the basis for making and evaluating decisions. 
And we would be doing this for a decade. 
Accurately counting all of our people should not be a partisan issue. 
Businesses, researchers, policymakers, State and local governments all count on 
the data that flows from the Census. 
I look forward to our witnesses’ testimony. 
PREPAREDSTATEMENTOFHON. MIKELEE, CHAIRMAN, JOINTECONOMICCOMMITTEE 
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for this hearing of the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee. I want to thank Vice Chair Maloney for organizing a discussion 
about this very important series of topics. 
Today, Federal data and surveys provide the American people invaluable informa-
tion about our Nation’s society and our economy. But there are two key categories 
of information that are currently absent from our Federal surveys—categories that 
I’d like to highlight during today’s hearing. 
First, our Federal surveys—and in particular, the American Community Survey 
(ACS) and Current Population Survey (CPS)—fail to include information about past 
involvement with the criminal justice system. In other words, they do not tell us 
whether someone has been convicted of a crime, been on probation or parole, or been 
incarcerated. 
Such data would be invaluable for understanding how much these experiences are 
a barrier to employment. For example, it would help us answer questions like: 
How many people out of the labor force are there because they have criminal 
records? And how does this vary in terms of geography and demographics? 
In our own research on prime-age men who are out of the labor force, the JEC’s 
Social Capital Project has found that one-third of these men have been incarcerated. 
And there is further evidence to suggest that men who are not employed are more 
likely to have a criminal record than men who are. 
Indeed, we ought to have a fuller picture of this often-forgotten segment of our 
population and figure out what is necessary to help them. Our goal should be to 
make sure that our justice system is, in fact, just—that the punishment fits both 
the crime and the criminal, being neither too lenient nor too harsh—and to help 
these men and women re-enter society and become productive members of our fami-
lies and communities. 
That’s precisely why I’ve worked with many of my colleagues on legislation to this 
end, like the First Step Act, which was signed into law by the President this past 
December and included much-needed sentencing and prison reforms. Having more 
complete data on these topics in our Federal surveys would only further aid us in 
achieving these goals. 
Second,  our  surveys  include  limited  information  on  social  capital,  or  our 
associational life—which is arguably the most important factor for understanding 
our Nation’s health and happiness. 
The Current Population Survey has included a few questions on social capital and 
associational life since 2002, but there is much that is lacking. For instance, it pro-
vides little information on trust or confidence in our institutions, especially local 
ones. It does not track loneliness, happiness, or the availability of emotional sup-
port; and it does not include information on the availability of public amenities like 
libraries, parks, and playgrounds, which have been shown to correlate with commu-
nity involvement. 
The CPS could—and I think should—provide more information on the social inter-
action that takes place between families, friends, neighbors, congregants, and co-
workers. And it could provide important details on the ways that technology hinders 
and helps social interaction.

Furthermore, having more social capital information in these surveys would help 
all of us simply because, as research shows, strong social capital is conducive to 
finding and getting work. 
Learning this information would provide us some missing pieces to the puzzle, 
giving us a clearer picture of ways we can strengthen our economy and help our 
citizens be happy and productive members of our communities. 
I look forward to hearing our witnesses’ insights on these topics today. Thank you.

Census Bureau researchers reportedly recommended against adding a 
citizenship question to the 2020 Census, which they said would produce 
citizenship information that is less accurate and more expensive than ex-
isting government data. 
• Doesn’t the inclusion of a citizenship question compromise the accu-
racy of the Census by making certain residents less likely to respond? 
Census Bureau researchers say they expect that the inclusion of a citizenship 
question on the 2020 Census will compromise the accuracy of the total population 
count and the distribution of population characteristics (such as age, sex, and race). 
Sources: 
• J. David Brown et al., ‘‘Understanding the Quality of Alternative Citizenship 
Data Sources for the 2020 Census,’’ U.S. Census Bureau, CES 18–38, August 
2018. 
• J. David, Brown, et al., ‘‘Estimating the Potential Effects of Adding a Citizen-
ship Question to the 2020 Census,’’ IZA Discussion Papers 12087, Institute of 
Labor Economics (IZA), 2019.

ber 2017 
Presentation: Respondent Confidentiality Concerns and Possible Effects on 
Response Rates and Data Quality for the 2020 Census 
Memorandum: Respondent Confidentiality Concerns 
Summary finding from the 2018 paper, p. 54: 
This paper’s examination of several Census Bureau surveys with and with-
out citizenship questions suggests that households that may contain non-
citizens are more sensitive to the inclusion of citizenship in the question-
naire than all-citizen households. The implication is that adding a citizen-
ship question to the 2020 Census would lead to lower self-response rates 
in households potentially containing noncitizens, resulting in more non-
response follow-up (NRFU) fieldwork, more proxy responses, and a lower- 
quality population count. (emphasis added) 
On pp. 38–39 of the same paper, the authors estimate that households with a non- 
citizen would have a Census self-response rate 5.8 percentage points less than 
households without a non-citizen. They further find that as ‘‘the level of concern 
about using citizenship data for enforcement purposes may be very different in 2020 
than it was in 2000 or 2010,’’ the 5.8 percent differential is a conservative esti-
mate—it may well be higher.

In 2016, we saw unprecedented foreign interference in our elections—in-
cluding through social media platforms, where foreign agents sought to 
discourage voter participation in our country. 
• How concerned are you about potential hacking or disinformation cam-
paigns in advance of the 2020 Census in light of the fact that it will be 
one of the first Censuses performed online? 
Thank you for your question regarding potential cyberattacks or disinformation 
campaigns in advance of the 2020 Census. 
I am not a cyber-security expert, but as a frequent user of Census Bureau prod-
ucts the introduction of an online response form is a topic I am watching for this 
very reason. I know that this is a top issue for the Census Bureau, as they recognize 
the constantly evolving potential for threats to online material. I also know that the 
privacy restrictions placed on data via Title 13 are of paramount importance to ca-
reer members of the Census Bureau. 
Due to this context, I rely on the reporting of the career Census Bureau staff, par-
ticularly through the 2020 Census Program Management Reviews. These reviews 
have been held quarterly since 2013. The August 3, 2018, PMR had a session high-
lighting what the Census Bureau is doing in regards to cybersecurity. In his opening 
comments, Kevin Smith (Chief Information Officer) said: 
I want to stress that the protection of the data we collect is the Census’s 
highest priority, and I want to describe it is not just the technology but the 
people and the processes we use in our culture we go through to help make

sure everyone is aware of the importance of the data and takes action to 
protect it. 
Video for this PMR can be found here https://youtu.be/pLZlt83rLZg?t=2085 and

touch on cyber security in the October 2018 and February 2019 PMRs. 
Additionally, we had the opportunity to host Census Bureau Director Dillingham 
at the Gardner Policy Institute on May 7. During his visit, he participated in a 
Newsmaker Breakfast, speaking to the public about the 2020 Census. In his re-
marks, he mentioned that the Census Bureau is working closely with experts in and 
out of government to stress test their system and create a platform that is nimble 
and could adjust to threats. He mentioned that the Census Bureau is working with 
the largest IT firms in the Nation to address the issue. (Topic begins around 49:30— 
https://www.facebook.com/gardnerpolicyinstitute/videos/850462068623931/) 
Regarding disinformation, the Census Bureau has mentioned that this will be ad-
dressed in their forthcoming communications plans. The 2020 Census communica-
tion efforts in Utah are being constructed with the consideration that digital cam-
paigns to create confusion may very well be present. Additionally, the State Data 
Center network is constantly watching for things that might confuse people regard-
ing the decennial count. The network is active and engaged. This slightly more 
grassroots space for states allows space for clear, connected narratives to develop 
and be disseminated more quickly than through formal Census Bureau processes. 
I know the reintroduction of paper forms for voting is proposed in some commu-
nities to avoid cyber interference. Although online response is getting all the press, 
there are alternatives. If communities feel unsafe or uncertain utilizing the online 
response platform, paper forms and over-the-phone response are options for re-
sponse in 2020. 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this topic.

A Hearing of the Joint Economic Committee, U.S. Congress 
The Economic Impacts of the 2020 Census and Business Uses of Federal Data 
Statement of Andrew Reamer, PhD 
Research Professor, George Washington Institute of Public Policy 
George Washington University 
May 22, 2019 
Introduction  
Chairman Lee, Vice-Chair Maloney, and distinguished members of the Joint Economic 
Committee, I appreciate your invitation to speak today about the economic impacts of the 2020 
Census and the business uses of federal data. My observations are based on my study of the 
uses of federal statistics as well as on 20 years’ experience running a regional economic 
development consulting practice. 
The widespread use of data derived from the decennial census by businesses and nonprofit 
organizations, workers and students, and federal, state and local governments has a substantial 
positive effect on the vitality of the U.S. economy and the nation’s 6 million private firms. To 
put this number in perspective, 5.3 million U.S. firms (89 percent) have less than 20 employees. 
At the same time, the 20,000 firms with 500 or more employees account for nearly half of 
private employment. In other words, the availability of census-derived data has a substantial 
impact on the profitability of millions of very small firms and of the very large firms that 
collectively employ tens of millions of workers. 
Census-derived Datasets 
Datasets from the decennial census are rarely directly used in economic decisions—decennial 
data are only gathered once a decade and for a handful of variables, such as gender, age, race, 
and Hispanic origin. Rather, the decennial census is essential for effective economic decision-

making because it provides a strong foundation for the development of multiple federal 
datasets designed to guide public and private decision-making. 
We can think of these census-derived datasets in three groups:  
•  The first includes annual Census Bureau Population Estimates (PE) and Housing 
Estimates of the same data variables collected in the decennial census (such as age, 
sex, race).  
•  The second group includes the household surveys carried out by the Census Bureau 
for itself and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), including the American Community 
Survey (ACS), the Current Population Survey (CPS), and the Consumer Expenditure 
Survey (CEX). The ACS, CPS, and CEX gathers data on non-decennial variables critical 
to economic decision-making, such income, occupation, education, commuting 
patterns, and housing conditions.1  
•  The third group of census-derived datasets are geographic classifications. After each 
census, the Census Bureau provides an Urban-Rural Classification (URC) of each 
census tract, as determined by decennial census population density. Using the URC, 
PE, and ACS, the Office of Management and Budget delineates the nation’s Core-
Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs), specifically metropolitan and micropolitan areas, 
that become the basis for regional economic analysis and planning.2,3 
   
                                                 
1 The ACS, CPS, and CEX rely on the decennial census as the frame from which to design and draw the sample and 
weight each household’s response in relation to the overall number of people of similar age, sex, race, and 
Hispanic origin. See Andrew Reamer, Census-derived Datasets Used to Distribute Federal Funds, 2018, p. 7. 
2 Census-derived datasets in each grouping rely on datasets in the other groupings. So, for instance: Population 
Estimates uses the ACS to measure the international in-migration component of population change; CBSA 
delineations are determined on the basis of Population Estimates and intercounty commuting patterns from the 
ACS; and the household surveys use Population Estimates to calculate population totals by characteristic—such as 
the number of people in poverty or with a bachelor’s degree—and to provide data by CBSAs.   
3 The ACS is the workhouse of this system—almost every census-derived dataset relies on it in some way. The ACS 
is the current incarnation of Representative James Madison’s amendment to the Census Act of 1790 that the First 
Census should be expanded beyond “bare enumeration” for the purposes of apportionment to collect data on 
demographic characteristics so that Congress could “adapt the public measures to the particular circumstances of 
the community.” (Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3: James Madison, Census Bill, House of Representatives, The 
Founders Constitution, University of Chicago.)

Business Uses and Economic Impacts of Census-derived Data 
The vitality of the nation’s economy and the 6 million businesses inside that economy are 
greatly affected by decisions made using census-derived data—by businesses themselves, of 
course, and as well as by the federal government, state and local governments, workers, and 
students. 
Businesses. Firms depend on census-derived data to determine if and where to open a business 
establishment, how large to make that establishment, and what goods and services to provide.  
•  In choosing where to locate their operations, businesses use site selection 
consultants and software that rely on census-derived data.4  
•  To know the number and characteristics of prospective customers in a community, 
businesses retain census-guided data intermediaries such as Claritas, Esri, PlaceIQ, 
and Caliper.5  
•  To ensure they have good access to the right kinds of workers, businesses use 
census-derived data to understand the supply and characteristics of an economic 
area’s workforce (such as educational attainment), housing conditions and costs, 
and where people live in relation to where a business might locate.6 
•  To understand what goods and services to provide, firms employ market research 
companies that analyze census-derived data.7 
•  To grasp the extent to which they are penetrating the marketplace, businesses hire 
polling firms (such as Nielsen) that produce estimates on the basis of census-derived 
data.8 
Federal Government. Federal uses of census-derived data affect the U.S. economy and 
businesses in four major ways.

•  First, census and census-derived data determine congressional apportionment and 
redistricting.9 The results strongly influence the nature of the federal laws that affect 
business operations. 
•  Second, census-derived economic indicators guide federal macroeconomic and 
other policies that determine the economic conditions in which businesses operate. 
Examples of such indicators include the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP), Personal Income, per capita income, labor force and unemployment 
measures, and poverty rates.10  
•  Third, by law and regulation, the federal government uses census-derived data to 
guide the fair geographic allocation of over $900 billion annually across 325 federal 
spending programs. Census-derived data are used to determine geographic eligibility 
(e.g., medically underserved areas, Opportunity Zones); see that each state and area 
gets its correct share of congressional appropriations (e.g., for CHIP, mass transit); 
and indicate which communities (e.g., those with high unemployment) receive 
preferences in those allocations. Census-guided allocations strongly influence the 
economic conditions under which businesses operate.11 
•  Fourth, multiple federal agencies (e.g., Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
Department of Homeland Security, and Treasury Department) and government-
sponsored enterprises (e.g., Fannie Mae), depend on census-derived data to shape 
policies, programs, and plans that affect businesses directly (e.g., access to financial 
capital) and indirectly (e.g., employee access to home mortgages).12 
State and Local Governments. State and local governments use census-derived data to 
determine how best to deliver services, for example, where to place schools, highways, and 
health clinics; how to design police patrols; and how to respond to natural disasters and other

emergencies. These various decisions affect the economic conditions under which businesses 
operate—such as transportation infrastructure, labor markets, and housing markets. 
State and local governments also use census-derived data to draw legislative boundaries, which 
in turn influence the nature of laws that affect businesses.13 
As state governments are required to balance their budgets, they rely on census-derived data 
(largely from the Bureau of Economic Analysis [BEA]) to project revenues and expenditures.14 In 
addition, about half of state governments use census-derived data to adhere to tax and 
expenditure limitations (TELs). Census-derived datasets used for TELs include population 
growth, per capita income growth, and inflation growth.15 Also, state agencies use census-
derived data to direct federally funded subgrants (e.g., Title I, WIC, WIOA training programs, 
CDBG non-entitlement) to counties, cities, school districts, and workforce investment areas.16 
Each of these decisions affect business operations. 
Labor Force. Finally, students and workers use census-derived data to make personal decisions 
that greatly affect labor availability for businesses. Students choose majors and careers on the 
basis of census-derived data.17 Labor force participants use the data to determine where to 
look for a job, in which neighborhood to live, and which type of postsecondary credential to 
pursue, such as an industry-recognized certification or community college certificate.18 
Conclusion  
Given the ubiquitous use of census-derived data for decision-making with economic 
consequences, it is clear that the qualities of those decisions very much depend on the accuracy 
of the 2020 Census. To the extent that full and accurate responses to the 2020 Census by every

A Hearing of the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress 
“The Economic Impacts of the 2020 Census and Business Uses of Federal Data” 
May 22, 2019 
Statement of Howard Fienberg 
VP Advocacy, Insights Association 
Codirector, The Census Project 
 
Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Maloney and members of the Joint Economic Committee, thank you 
for the opportunity to testify today about the importance of the 2020 Census to American 
business. Data from the Census doesn’t just underpin American democracy and guide Federal 
spending, they form the backbone of data-driven decision making in the private sector. This 
data helps U.S. businesses promote economic development, identify and serve customers and 
create jobs. 
I’m wearing two hats at today’s hearing. The first is representing the Insights Association,1 the 
leading nonprofit association representing the marketing research and data analytics industry. 
Our industry delivers insights to drive good business decisions. Research studies in the U.S. 
require the most accurate decennial data in order to produce statistically representative 
samples of the U.S. population, or segments thereof. Even the most essential Federal 
government surveys, like the American Community Survey (ACS) (formerly known as the census 
“long form”) and the Economic Census, are built on decennial census data. Without accurate 
census data, American businesses can’t know what America needs (to paraphrase the 2000 
Census tagline). 
My second hat is codirector of the Census Project,2 a broad-based coalition of national, state, 
and local organizations and companies that support an inclusive and accurate 2020 Census and 
ACS, including hundreds of state and local government groups, business trade associations, 
labor unions, academia, religious groups and civil rights activists.3 
While the Census Bureau aims for a 100% accounting of the U.S. population every ten years, 
our nation rarely achieves that goal. Hard-to-count populations and areas (such as remote and

3 For example, the Census Project recently led a letter from more than 130 stakeholder groups requesting 
$8.45 billion for the Census Bureau in FY 2020 - https://thecensusproject.org/alarm-raised-with-congress-
on-census-funding-shortfall-census-experts-say-administration-budget-is-short-more-than-2-billion/ - and 
helped to organize 28 business groups last year in support of FY19 census funding -

rural areas, racial and ethnic minorities, young children, and low-income households) are 
normally undercounted in the decennial.4 My testimony will illustrate some of the big impact 
from small inaccuracies in census data, to demonstrate the need to fully fund the 2020 Census. 
Business uses of census data 
Many companies, whether large multinationals or fledgling small businesses, use the intricacies 
of census population and demographic data5 to: 
  decide where, when or if to site a business; 
  find the right consumer base; 
  discover (and then satisfy) consumers’ unmet needs and wants; 
  identify and locate the best and most appropriate workforce (by education level, 
unemployment rate, or other factors) to run their business; 
  find where the workforce of the future (or near-future) is being produced; 
  take risks on up-and-coming neighborhoods that potentially may suit the business (in 
terms of customer, workforce, or infrastructure and other support systems); 
  discover locations with the right infrastructure to support their business and workforce 
(or facilitate their consumers’ access to and use of their business’ services or products); 
and 
  figure out which neighborhoods sport the right kind of government funding for 
infrastructure their specific businesses care about.6 
Manufacturers, retailers, and financial analysts use the data to measure a company’s health, 
compensate employees, quantify ROI, identify new opportunities, forecast performance, and 
optimize consumer price and strategies. Financial Institutions use Census data to identify 
lending and investment opportunities, set rates and terms, tailor financial programs to the local 
neighborhood level, and determine the best locations for branches. 
Census data explains more than just how many people live where, it ""describes their living 
arrangements, ages, income, educational attainment, commuting patterns and occupations...

Committee for Civic Participation. January 31, 2017. https://funderscommittee.org/resource/census-
accuracy-and-the-undercount-why-it-matters-how-its-measured/  
5 While many Insights Association members use Census data to develop insights, some small businesses 
go straight to Census Bureau data via the Census Bureau’s Census Business Builder - 
https://www.census.gov/data/data-tools/cbb.html - which provides “selected demographic and economic 
data... tailored to specific types of users in a simple to access and use format."" 
6 According to the former president and CEO of the Business Council of Alabama, census data helps 
businesses ""identify barriers and solutions to improve our local schools, health care system, and 
transportation options that our workers rely on.” -- ""Our workplace and economy depend on an accurate 
Census."" by William Canary. AL.com. April 15, 2019. https://www.al.com/opinion/2019/04/our-workplace-
and-economy-depend-on-an-accurate-census.html

the kinds of homes people have, in terms of age of home, number of rooms, value, whether it 
has complete kitchen and plumbing facilities, the availability of telephones and automobiles 
and the type of home-heating fuel used.""7 
Because accurate census data is considered the gold standard of publicly available data, it 
creates a competitive advantage for our country. Economic development agencies like the 
Greater Houston Partnership utilize Census data at the neighborhood level to attract and retain 
business investment in their cities based on points like infrastructure data, education levels, 
and traffic patterns.8 American localities can use census data to attract and keep business not 
just across the U.S., but across the globe. One of the greatest barriers to international 
expansion is the lack of good, transparent data, but census data gives the private sector the 
confidence to get their capital off the sidelines and put it to productive use here in the U.S. 
Data-driven decisions are even more reliant on accurate census data when they involve small or 
hard-to-count demographic groups or areas. Starbucks can easily open another coffee shop in 
Manhattan’s financial district, but it takes the most accurate census-based insights to justify 
one in rural Arkansas. Census (and ACS) data give companies comparable, consistent, timely, 
and high-quality demographic and socio-economic data for all American communities, down to 
the neighborhood and census tract levels, so that we can accurately compare an East Asian 
immigrant neighborhood in downtown New Orleans to a low-income Hispanic neighborhood of 
Austin, a middle-class small town in rural Washington State, and a large suburb of Chicago. 
The Census Bureau has compiled a few case examples for how businesses use Census data, 
such as helping: 
  a ""high-end mountain bike component manufacturer"" to open ""his own bike shop to sell 
his manufactured components along with mountain bikes and other components"" in 
Portland, Oregon;9

competitors to his business but also potential businesses to partner with by opening a leased department

The trickle-down impact of an inaccurate decennial census would restrain or ruin American 
businesses for a whole decade: 
  Utah-based Qualtrics, an Insights Association company member providing software to 
measure and improve the customer experience for thousands of brands around the 
world, would struggle to provide them with the data necessary to do so, absent census-
benchmarked statistical sampling. 
  J.M. Smucker, a member of ours based in Ohio, might have to locate new manufacturing 
and production facilities outside of the country rather than risk investing in a small 
American town with no accurate measure of its local workforce. 
                                                           
10 “A restauranteur in Albuquerque, New Mexico considered adding a drive-through window to each of his 
five restaurants but was not sure that his sales would increase enough to warrant the required investment 
in equipment and personnel or the disruption to the business during the installation period. He spoke with 
other restauranteurs in his area who had drive-through windows about their experiences but few were 
willing to share information about the competitive advantage they believed they had. Using the Products 
Line data from the Economic Census for Limited Service Restaurants (NAICS 722513), he was able to 
determine that similar businesses in New Mexico typically saw around 29.3% ($406.4 Million) of their 
sales of food and 10.4% ($144.2 Million) of their sales of nonalcoholic beverages from their drive-through 
receipts. Using these data, he applied for and received a ten-year small business loan to help pay for the 
installation of the drive-through in each of his five locations. His sales increased enough that he was able 
to pay off the note in three years."" -- ""Uses of Data."" https://www.census.gov/programs-

11 ""A utility truck manufacturer was doing a periodic review of its network of dealerships and repair 
facilities across the U.S. They were happy to see that most of their facilities reported high customer 
satisfaction scores from the surveys they did with their customers, but were disappointed to see that 
some were not doing as well. Especially concerning was that the complaints were not about the quality of 
the service provided but the time it was taking to get an appointment and get the vehicle repaired. 
Customers also complained about the distance they had to travel (at great expense) for service. Their 
planning staff considered relocating some of the locations to better serve the existing customers, but 
senior staff were concerned about the costs. Using Census business data, headquarters staff were able 
to identify (on a map) the numbers of businesses (plumbing and electrical contractors) that typically used 
their vehicles throughout their covered service areas. They overlaid a map of their service facilities on top; 
doing so quickly revealed areas with many potential customers but no dealerships or repair facilities 
within 50 miles. They also noted that the service area of some of their under-performing facilities 
overlapped with other areas. Using Census data, the planning staff were able to convince senior 
managers that changes were needed. They decided that some facilities should be relocated and new 
facilities opened to better serve their markets. When the next periodic review was done, the customer 
satisfaction scores had significantly improved."" -- ""Uses of Data."" https://www.census.gov/programs-

  A rural utility would not know where to site new cell towers, electric transmission lines, 
or water lines, so certain communities would go without enough coverage while others 
might end up unnecessarily over-saturated.  
  An obstetrics practice might not be opened in an area growing dense with young family 
households if census data can't accurately reflect the neighborhood’s demographic 
trends (costing the medical practice profits and the local community the benefits of 
care). 
  A business might not invest in a certain neighborhood without special tax treatment for 
requisite concentrations of low or moderate-income households – incentives that would 
be unavailable without accurate census data to qualify them.12 
  Retail companies like Target wouldn’t be able to accurately understand their local 
stores’ customer bases, plan where and how to exactly stock certain goods and where 
to display them on shelves in specific stores, or track changes in consumer preferences 
between urban, suburban and rural communities in a timely fashion.13 
  An Insights Association member company conducting public opinion polling, like Ipsos, 
would not know how representative survey results of contentious political issues would 
be of the total population, let alone important demographic segments (e.g., African 
American women between 30 and 45), leaving policymakers and stakeholders guessing. 
  A marketing research and data analytics company like Insights Association company 
member Kantar measures the U.S. media audience, setting the rates for advertising, 
publication and programming across the country. Without accurate census data, ad 
spending and media programming would target the wrong areas and demographic 
segments, miss others entirely, or not be produced/delivered at all.14  
  For a retail real estate project, a member of the International Council of Shopping 
Centers (ICSC) would be unable to conduct the extensive market analyses needed to 
accurately “determine, among other things: where to build, what to build, and when to

14 As the CEO of another major audience measurement provider, Nielsen, recently wrote in The New York 
Times: “American businesses’ reliance on this data cannot be overstated. As soon as the decennial 
census data is available, for example, we revise our ranking of the top media markets in the United 
States, by population. This “designated market area” list is always eagerly anticipated by our clients, and 
it has a direct impact on how advertisers spend their money.” … ""In the era of big data, an accurate 
census is more critical than ever. We know that big data sets have inherent structural biases, and those 
biases require calibration to a “truth set,” which in almost all cases is benchmarked to the census. Even a 
small error in the census can be amplified over and over again as the data is used in new and ever 
evolving ways. The last thing that business needs is for the next 10 years of data to be built on a faulty 
foundation."" - ""A C.E.O.’s Plea: Don’t Mess With the Census."" By David Kenny. The New York Times.

build,” nor would the company have accurate data for “sales forecasting, trade area 
delineation, target marketing and supply chain management.”15 
  The National Association of REALTORS ® would be unable to benchmark its home sales 
figures and struggle to properly analyze trends in migration among recent movers, 
generational demand or household formation.16 
  A broadcaster like Univision would have a smaller amount of the audience “represented 
in data,” resulting in fewer “potential advertisers” desiring or agreeing to advertise “if 
ratings decline overall or take a notable dip” and “less inclusive programming and fewer 
executives of color in the C-suite.”17 
Ensuring the most accurate 2020 Census 
The dependence on accurate census data of American businesses, especially the marketing 
research and data analytics industry, drives our advocacy for adequate resources for the Census 
Bureau over the whole decennial lifecycle. We’re extremely concerned about that accuracy, 
given the cancellation of essential 2020 Census field testing in remote and rural areas,18 the 
potential drop in response rate due to the addition of a citizenship question19 (and a general 
growing distrust in government), and the Administration’s plan to not spend all available 
resources allocated by Congress for FY2019 during FY2019,20 We’re also worried about the 
severe impact of a continuing resolution or shutdown heading into FY2020 without a funding

18 Due to funding shortfalls, the Census Bureau had to cancel 2017 tests of special counting procedures 
for tribal lands and rural and remote areas in the Dakotas, Washington state and Puerto Rico. The same 
effectively happened for the 2018 end-to-end readiness test, which was supposed to be of 700,000 varied

anomaly for the Census Bureau, since the decennial census has legally-required deadlines to 
follow, and playing catch-up can be challenging (and expensive). 
The Insights Association, and the business community at large, are particularly concerned that, 
as it becomes time to scramble for the 2020 Census, funding for the ACS and Economic Census 
may be sacrificed. Any funding diversion from the ACS would reduce the sample size, 
preventing the survey from delivering accurate data on more than 40% of (mostly rural) U.S. 
counties and small towns, while funding diverted from the Economic Census would hurt our 
ability to track national and international productivity, trade, and employment 
For now, we’re pleased that the House CJS Appropriations Subcommittee approved FY2020 
funding legislation on May 17 with $7.5 billion for the 2020 Census and $8.45 billion for the 
Census Bureau overall (which is in line with census stakeholders’ request21).  
The Insights Association and the Census Project urge committee members from both sides of 
Congress and both political parties to quickly coalesce in support of the maximum amount of 
census funding, to ensure an inclusive and accurate accounting of our nation’s population. The 
2020 Census will help to determine the fate of American business for the next decade (and 
beyond). 
Thank you for inviting my testimony this afternoon. I look forward to answering your questions.

Written Testimony of Mallory Bateman, M.Sc.
Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute, University of Utah
May 22, 2019
Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Maloney, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to 
testify today. 
My name is Mallory Bateman. I am a Senior Research Analyst and the Utah State Data Center Coordinator 
at the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. The Gardner Institute develops and shares 
economic, demographic, and public policy research that helps people make INFORMED DECISIONS™. 
Our customers include business leaders, policymakers, community leaders, planners, researchers, non-
profit leaders, and others in need of fact-based research that enriches our community and positively 
shapes Utah’s future. 
I am also a member of the Census Bureau’s State Data Center Steering Committee, a member of Utah’s 
Complete Count Committee, and chair of Utah’s 2020 Census Technical Advisory Committee. 
My testimony today comes from the perspective of a frequent user of Census and other federal data. I 
also regularly interact with and advise people who use decennial census and other federal statistical 
data to inform their decisions. 
Utah’s unique demographics and thriving economy provide a great example of how important the 2020 
Census and other federal data are to the economic success of a state. In states with shifting demographics, 
decision makers cannot make wise and timely decisions to support and build flourishing communities 
without the decennial census and other federal data.

Utah background
Utah’s youthfulness, large households, racial and ethnic diversification, high rates of in-migration, and 
rural distress are just some of the many areas where Utah decision makers rely on the Census and other 
federal data to inform their decisions. Without this federal data, decision makers lack vital information, 
making it difficult to support a successful economy. I’d like to share a few details. 
Utah’s 3.16 million residents have distinct demographic characteristics. Utah has the youngest median 
age, largest average household size in the nation, and our population growth has been the fastest in the 
nation since 2010. The state is also rapidly diversifying racially, ethnically, and culturally. 
Utah’s strong job and broad industry growth attract new people to our state each year. In the past five 
years, we’ve added over 100,000 new residents as a result of net in-migration. Migration has become a 
more consistent and significant component of our population growth. Nearly half of the 1 million 
residents who helped our population reach 3 million by 2015 are those who moved to the state and 
their children. 
New communities have also emerged since 2010. In some areas, this means completely new investments 
in infrastructure, public safety, education, housing, and businesses. These areas have no baseline, so the 
2020 Census provides the first opportunity to learn about the population. 
Some of our rural areas have experienced population losses since 2010. While we have limited data 
availability from the American Community Survey, these communities have small total populations. We 
need the 100 percent coverage provided by the 2020 Census to fully understand the demographics of 
these communities.
I share this detail about Utah’s youthfulness, large households, racial and ethnic diversification, high 
rates of in-migration, and rural distress to make a point. The 2020 Census and other federal data are 
paramount to our state so we can understand the characteristics of new growth. Without it, we lack 
information about these new Utahns. 
We need 2020 Census and other federal data to do the following1:
-  Inform local business decisions
-  Assist elected officials with tax, expenditure and regulatory decisions
-  Help with transportation, water, education and other investment 
-  Serve as a basis for representative government (redistricting)
-  Help with the allocation of federal funds

Connection between 2020 Census and economic decision making
I’d now like to share my thoughts about the connection between the 2020 Census and economic 
decision making.
The Utah State Data Center regularly handles requests for demographic information from state and local 
government, media, real estate developers, academics, community organizers, and others, seeking to 
learn  more  about  their  communities  or  regions.  The  data  provided  help  with  decisions  about 
programming, investments, business location, and future planning. These requests remind me on a 
regular basis of the connection between Census Bureau and other federal data and the Utah economy. 
As chair of the Gardner Institute’s 2020 Census Technical Advisory Committee, I have been surprised to 
meet decision makers who believe that decennial data are only used by and for government. I work 
closely with our statewide Complete Count Committee co-chairs to maintain a constant narrative that 
decennial census data provides the baseline for myriad datasets that inform business decisions across 
all industries and government funding at all levels.
The most straightforward way I have found to convey the pervasiveness and consequential influence of 
the decennial census is this: if a funding calculation utilizes a ‘per capita’ measure or a sampling window 
based on a total population, it is highly likely decennial census data is the denominator. 
Our Director of Demographic Research, Dr. Pamela Perlich, likes to call our team ‘the denominator 
people’. Decennial data is the baseline for the state and county-level population estimates and projections 
we  produce. These  projections  are  a  direct  input  for  education,  healthcare,  transportation,  and 
infrastructure planning efforts, which then turn into significant investment at the state and local level. 
Utahns recognize the importance of a complete count from the 2020 Census. Community leaders from 
nonprofits, community organizations, private industry, banking, and municipal government have 
partnered to urge state decision makers to support local outreach efforts this year.2  Their logic 
emphasizes the importance to a diverse array of interests, from economic development to health and 
safety of Utah residents. 
The Utah Legislature is considering a $1 million allocation to Utah’s complete count efforts, the first 
funding for the decennial census in the state. Several county and city level governments have also 
recognized the significance of the 2020 Census and have dedicated funds to try and achieve a complete 
count. Our Utah State Library is establishing a grant program to help local libraries fund their census 
outreach efforts. 
The work by Professor Reamer indicates that in FY2016, Utah received about $5.7 billion from 55 federal 
census-guided funding programs.3 Calculations by the Utah Governor’s Office of Management and 
Budget indicate this was around 27% of the state budget in that timeframe. These investments will pay 
for themselves quickly.

Conclusion
In Utah, we rely on a complete count of everyone once, only once, and in the right place. We count on 
this updated framework once a decade. Our population is changing fast and information is key. We 
cannot make informed decisions that support our businesses, neighborhoods, and broader economy 
without this data. We want to inform decision makers across agencies, organizations, and industries on 
who their constituents and customers are, and plan appropriately in regions that may need additional 
assistance.
Thank you for holding this hearing and I look forward to a successful 2020 Census.

Statement before the Joint Economic Committee  
On the Economic Impacts of the 2020 Census and Business Uses of Federal Data  
 
 
America’s Invisible Felon Population: 
A Blind Spot in US National Statistics

Mister Chairman, Madame Vice Chair, Members of the Committee, distinguished co-panelists, 
and guests: 
America’s statistical agencies are the eyes and ears of our democracy. When they are functioning 
properly, they provide essential information to help the public and its elected representatives see 
what is going right in our country—and what is going wrong. Such information is crucial for 
forming a more perfect union. Without timely and accurate information on our domestic 
problems, our government cannot hope to address these problems swiftly, much less effectively. 
Whether you are a progressive or a conservative, in favor of more government or less, you need 
good data to inform your own efforts to make our country better. 
The US was the first government in the modern era to recognize the importance of evidence-
based public policy.1 Our Constitution mandated a decennial census—a truly revolutionary 
notion back in the late 18th century. Providing policymakers with accurate empirical information 
was essential, in the words of James Madison, “in order that they might rest their arguments on 
facts, rather than assertion and conjecture.”2 And for most of our history, the US statistical 
system has been well ahead of the curve, if not a virtual wonder of the world. 
Unfortunately, our government statistical services seem to have been falling away from the 
global forefront for at least a generation. And in key areas, our federal information systems have 
not kept up with the social and economic changes in our country that they should be helping us 
monitor. Sad to say, our statistical services are currently incapable of providing even the most 
basic facts and figures we need for confronting some of our new and pressing domestic social 
troubles. 
In my book Men Without Work: America’s Invisible Crisis, I tried to highlight our country’s 
curious inattention to the collapse of work for grown men over the postwar era.3 Although their 
employment situation has been slowly improving since 2016, when my study was published, the 
latest Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report (for April 2019) indicates that “work rates” (more 
technically, employment-to-population ratios) for working-age US men are nonetheless on par 
with the levels for 1939, as reported in the 1940 Census.4 In other words, today’s employment 
situation for our country’s civilian, noninstitutional, non-retirement-age men is still a 
Depression-scale problem.  
Our failure to cope more expeditiously with this problem, I submit, is in part due to our failure to 
understand it—a failure, in turn, directly related to the inadequacy of our statistical services to 
illuminate this problem’s important dimensions. I pointed then to a number of shortcomings and 
gaps in official statistical coverage that limit the information policymakers and concerned 
citizens should want to have about America’s still-ongoing “Men Without Work” crisis.  
Today I wish to point out just one of these gaps—but it is an enormous blind spot and, given the 
realities of life in our country today, a critical and inexplicable statistical oversight. I refer here to 
the virtual absence in our national statistical compendia of facts and figures about the country’s 
arrested and sentenced populations. These are enormous populations in our country today—yet 
our government statistical systems can tell us almost nothing about them. 
Over the postwar era, for good or ill, the US has seen an explosive surge in both arrests and 
felony sentencing for our adult population. Like it or not, this is a plain fact of life. In 2016, 110 
million Americans had an arrest record with police authorities.5 That is over twice as many 
people as in 1997 (when the total was 54 million6) and works out to 44 percent of our adult 
population.7 Just over 91 million Americans that year were included in the Interstate 
Identification Index, the database the FBI uses to determine whether someone has a criminal 
record.8 That would be two-fifths of the US adult population in 2016.  
What do we know about this huge contingent of people? Almost nothing. Age, sex, ethnicity, 
living arrangement, family situation, income, educational profile, health status, and all the rest of 
the data the US federal statistical system collects for our national population cannot be cross-
referenced by arrest status, at least thus far 
And the situation is even worse for demographic, social, and economic data on the population 
subject to felony sentencing. It is not just that the US government provides no information 
whatsoever on the social, economic, or health conditions of the men and women in America who 
have been convicted of a serious crime punishable by imprisonment for a year or more (the 
standard definition of a felony)—though this too happens to be the case. Astonishing as this may 
sound, the US statistical system does not even offer an estimate for the total size of the 
population of Americans who have a felony conviction in their background! Search as one might 
for even a rough estimate from official statistical authorities of America’s convicted population, 
there is no government compendium to provide this information. So far as I can tell, US 
statistical authorities have never asked the question—and thus they do not have any ready means 
by which to answer it. 
Fortunately, some intrepid demographers from the academy have attempted a demographic 
reconstruction of postwar state and national trends for the size of the US adult population 
sentenced to at least one felony conviction.9 According to their estimates, the total number of US 
adults in this “convicted” population shot up from fewer than two million persons in 1948 to 
nearly 20 million in 2010 (Figure 1). Their calculations imply that as of 2010, fully one in 12 
adults in America bore a felony conviction in their past. A bit of additional arithmetic suggests 
that for men, the figure would have been over one in eight.10

http://users.soc.umn.edu/~uggen/Shannon_Uggen_DEM_2017.pdf.  
 
Naturally the criminal justice system has continued to arrest, convict, and sentence offenders 
since 2010. Rough calculations suggest that the total population with a felony in America today 
(2019) might equal or exceed 24 million.  
The American public is greatly concerned about the phenomenon sometimes referred to as “mass 
incarceration”—and rightly so. As of year-end 2016, well over two million person were behind 
bars in correctional facilities in the US.11 Usually missing from the conversation about mass 
incarceration, however, is any recognition that imprisoned or detained Americans currently 
represent barely one-tenth of the total population of felony convicts. As a ballpark estimate, over 
20 million Americans in society at large currently have a felony in their past, and this immense 
population is effectively statistically invisible. The Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, the Centers for Disease Control—none can tell us practically anything about 
conditions of life for these tens of millions of Americans.  
The fragmentary data that can be pieced together, however, hint that felons in the general 
population may pay a high long-term price for their crimes, even after they have paid their debt 
to society. Some longitudinal surveys, for example, indicate that, irrespective of ethnicity or 
education, a working-age man in the civilian noninstitutional population is far more likely to be 
out of the labor force altogether than a counterpart who has only an arrest in his background, and 
that man with an arrest record is much more likely to be out of the labor force than a counterpart 
who has no history of trouble with the law.12 (See Figure 2.)

and Criminal Justice System History, 2013

for discussion.  
Source: Nicholas Eberstadt, Men Without Work: America’s Invisible Crisis (West Conshohocken, PA: Templeton 
Press, 2016),  143. 
 
This troubling correlation has a direct bearing on our current “Men Without Work” problem, 
considering that something like one in eight unconfined adult men nowadays may has a felony 
conviction in his past—and that the corresponding ratio for prime working-age men (age 25–54) 
today is no doubt appreciably higher. 
What accounts for that grim gradient in Figure 2? There are many possible explanations, but we 
lack most of the data we would want to test these various hypotheses. And needless to say, 
evidence-based policies to help reintegrate ex-cons and ex-felons back into the labor force, and 
into families, and into society more generally require evidence in the first place.  
The circumstances of Americans who have had trouble with the law should not be a matter of 
utter indifference to a forgiving society, much less to the elected representatives entrusted with 
shaping and administering its policies. It is shocking—I would dare say shameful—that our 
statistical system should so entirely neglect the plight of this huge, stigmatized, and 
disadvantaged population in our society. 
We have a chance to end this statistical darkness. Including just one or two questions on criminal 
justice system history in the American Community Survey (ACS) could end this not-so-benign 
neglect.  
There are technical issues with including these questions. And at this juncture, including these 
questions in the 2020 Census and 2020 ACS is not legally or administratively feasible, given the 
provisions of the Census Act.13 But including them in due course is the right thing to do. 
Furthermore, there are other expeditious and less cumbersome ways to end this darkness 
immediately, at least in good part—such as by using linked administrative data files from the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. This would 
provide an aperture into the lives and conditions of the millions of Americans in society at large 
who live under “community supervision,” either via parole or probation.  
Irrespective of future policing and judicial policies, the population of arrested Americans and 
Americans with a felony is on track to continue to grow for many years to come—quite possibly 
for decades to come. For obvious reasons, approaches to reentry and rehabilitation today remain 
mainly anecdotal. It is past time to begin resting those arguments on facts.

Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney, Vice Chair of the Joint Economic Committee 
“The Economic Impacts of the 2020 Census and Business Uses of Federal Data” 
May 22, 2019 
 
I am pleased to hold this hearing examining the 
many economic uses of census and other federal 
data, particularly by U.S. businesses. 
 
Census data is the only source of objective and 
comprehensive data about the nation’s 
demographic characteristics down to the 
neighborhood-level. 
 
The decennial census provides the foundation 
for other federal surveys, including the 
American Community Survey. The ACS tracks 
social, demographic, economic and housing 
data, including educational attainment, income 
and earnings, employment status and housing 
value.  
 
 
Census data are an essential building block or 
benchmark for most nationally representative 
surveys—public and private, helping us to 
understand the economy, our workforce 
and opportunities for growth.  
General business use of Census data 
 
Businesses use census data to make economic 
and strategic decisions that determine the flow 
of almost $4 trillion in annual private 
investment. 
 
They use it to decide where to locate or expand 
operations and where to open new stores and 
distribution centers. Even what products to sell 
in which stores.  It affects where and how 
advertisers spend their dollars. 
 
When businesses plot their strategies, they look 
at census data to understand the skills of the 
workforce and the characteristics of potential 
customers.  
2 
 
Business examples – large corporations 
 
Let’s take a few examples. 
 
David Kenny, the CEO of Nielsen, in a recent 
New York Times op-ed, described how 
businesses rely on census data to make a broad 
range of strategic decisions.  
 
The census is used to identify where, for 
example, to put power lines, cell towers and 
hospitals.  
 
Target told us that the U.S. census is one of 
many resources that it uses to better understand 
the communities where they do business. 
   
3 
 
Business examples – regional planning 
 
In the 7 Rivers region, which includes southwest 
Wisconsin, southeast Minnesota and northeast 
Iowa, hundreds of businesses and community 
leaders are using census-based data to craft 
strategies to fill jobs and boost labor force 
participation.  
 
It starts with using data to understand who is 
unemployed, who has left the labor force, how 
much education have they attained. How do 
local workers compare to others nationwide? 
Are they younger, older, more likely to be male 
or female? 
 
The strategies that emerged from a careful 
analysis of the data are varied. One approach is 
to expand child care to make it more attractive 
for women with young children to enter the 
labor market.  
 
4 
 
The 7 Rivers Alliance is just one 
example. Every day, companies across the 
country make decisions based on census data to 
chart their future.  
Federal policy 
 
The decennial census is used to apportion 
representation in the U.S. House of 
Representatives and to determine allocation of 
federal funds. Hundreds of billions in federal 
dollars and fair political representation are on 
the table. 
 
Where we build roads, bridges, schools and 
other core infrastructure is based on federal 
data. 
 
How we target funds to address cancer, obesity 
and other health challenges depends on the 
Census. 
5 
 
 
It has been politicized 
 
Unfortunately, the 2020 census has been 
politicized through the citizenship 
question. Immigrant communities, already 
skeptical of the federal government, are 
reluctant to take part in a survey they believe 
could be used against them, jeopardizing their 
status. 
 
A recent study at Harvard found that the 
citizenship question could lead to 6 million 
Hispanics missing from the count. 
 
That means Hispanics would be 
underrepresented in Congress and would receive 
less in federal dollars. 
 
It means businesses would not get accurate data 
about the role Latinos play in the U.S. economy. 
 
6 
 
It means the 2020 census would not provide a 
fair and accurate count. 
 
The point of the census is to get a full count of 
the population. Any proposal that would limit or 
discourage participation would run counter to 
this very objective. 
 
This would undermine the integrity of the 
census data, inflicting substantial harm on 
businesses and others that depend on accurate 
data.  And it would undermine the right of every 
American to be represented.  
 
   
7 
 
Conclusion 
 
Getting the count wrong would be costly with 
far-reaching effects on nearly every segment of 
the population and on nearly every industry in 
our economy.  
 
We would be misallocating resources through 
misguided business investments and poorly 
targeted government expenditures.  
 
We would be using flawed data as the basis for 
making and evaluating decisions.  
 
And we would be doing this for a decade. 
 
Accurately counting all of our people should not 
be a partisan issue.  
 
 
 
 
8 
 
Businesses, researchers, policymakers, state and 
local governments all count on the data that 
flows from the Census.   
 
I look forward to our witnesses’ testimony.

Opening Statement  
JEC Hearing on “The Economic Impacts of the 2020 
Census and Business Uses of Federal Data” 
May 22, 2019, 2:00pm 
210 Cannon House Office Building 
 
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for this 
hearing of the Joint Economic Committee. I want to thank 
Vice-Chair Maloney for organizing a discussion about this 
very important series of topics. 
Today, federal data and surveys provide the American 
people invaluable information about our nation’s society 
and our economy. But there are two key categories of 
information that are currently absent from our federal 
surveys – categories that I’d like to highlight during today’s 
hearing. 
First, our federal surveys – and in particular, the American 
Community Survey (ACS) and Current Population Survey 
(CPS) – fail to include information about past involvement 
with the criminal justice system. In other words, they do 
not tell us whether someone has been convicted of a 
crime, been on probation or parole, or been incarcerated.  
Such data would be invaluable for understanding how 
much these experiences are a barrier to employment. For 
example, it would help us answer questions like:  
Page 1 of 4 
 
How many people out of the labor force are there because 
they have criminal records? And how does this vary in 
terms of geography and demographics? 
In our own research on prime-age men who are out of the 
labor force, the JEC’s Social Capital Project has found that 
one-third of these men have been incarcerated. And there 
is further evidence to suggest that men who are not 
employed are more likely to have a criminal record than 
men who are.  
Indeed, we ought to have a fuller picture of this often-
forgotten segment of our population and figure out what is 
necessary to help them. Our goal should be to make sure 
that our justice system is, in fact, just – that the 
punishment fits both the crime and the criminal, being 
neither too lenient nor too harsh – and to help these men 
and women re-enter society and become productive 
members of our families and communities.  
That’s precisely why I’ve worked with many of my 
colleagues on legislation to this end, like the First Step 
Act, which was signed into law by the president this past 
December and included much-needed sentencing and 
prison reforms. Having more complete data on these 
topics in our federal surveys would only further aid us in 
achieving these goals. 
Page 2 of 4 
 
Second, our surveys include limited information on social 
capital, or our associational life – which is arguably the 
most important factor for understanding our nation’s health 
and happiness. 
The Current Population Survey has included a few 
questions on social capital and associational life since 
2002, but there is much that is lacking. For instance, it 
provides little information on trust or confidence in our 
institutions, especially local ones. It does not track 
loneliness, happiness, or the availability of emotional 
support; and it does not include information on the 
availability of public amenities like libraries, parks, and 
playgrounds, which have been shown to correlate with 
community involvement.  
The CPS could – and I think should – provide more 
information on the social interaction that takes place 
between families, friends, neighbors, congregants, and 
coworkers. And it could provide important details on the 
ways that technology hinders and helps social interaction.  
Furthermore, having more social capital information in 
these surveys would help all of us simply because, as 
research shows, strong social capital is conducive to 
finding and getting work.  
Page 3 of 4 
 
Learning this information would provide us some missing 
pieces to the puzzle, giving us a clearer picture of ways 
we can strengthen our economy and help our citizens be 
happy and productive members of our communities.  
I look forward to hearing our witnesses’ insights on these 
topics today. Thank you.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE LEE, CHAIRMAN, A U.S. 
SENATOR FROM UTAH 
Chairman Lee. Good morning and welcome to this hearing of 
the Joint Economic Committee. 
To begin, I would like to welcome back the members of the Com-
mittee who were part of this body during the previous Congress, 
as well as our new members. And I would like to congratulate Rep-
resentative Maloney on her return as Vice Chair during this Con-
gress. I look forward to working with all of you. 
The topic of this hearing, Expanding Opportunity, is in many 
ways a quintessentially American topic. As Abraham Lincoln put 
so eloquently: The leading object of our government is, and has 
been, and I hope always will be, to elevate the condition of men, 
to lift artificial weights from all shoulders, to afford all an unfet-
tered start and a fair chance in the race of life. 
In other words, the purpose of government is to remove barriers 
for opportunity. Often, however, policymakers have a limited un-
derstanding of what ‘‘opportunity’’ is, what that word means. We 
sometimes see opportunity purely in terms of economic outcomes— 
namely, educational or financial success. And, moreover, we can 
view financial capital as the only important source of wealth on 
which opportunity in our society depends. 
Economic wealth is no doubt important. No one would dispute its 
importance. And it is right that the Federal Government should 
certainly seek to remove barriers to economic wealth. But to see op-
portunity exclusively in those terms fails adequately to capture an 
individual source of wealth on which human beings draw, and one

that is in fact key to expanding opportunity. And that is, Social 
Capital. 
Social capital is the wealth produced from our associational life, 
from what we do together as human beings in a particular society. 
It inheres in the web of social relationships through which we pur-
sue joint endeavors, and it comes from our families, our commu-
nities, churches, synagogues, rotary clubs, and little leagues, and 
it  is  through  these  institutions  of  civil  society  that  we  make  a 
happy and productive life with other people. They shape our char-
acters and our capacities. They help us address the challenges we 
face in life and provide us with meaning and purpose as we live 
our lives. 
For the past two years, the Social Capital Project on the Joint 
Economic Committee has documented trends in our associational 
life and its distribution across this great country. It has studied the 
evolving nature, quality, and importance of our associational life, 
and the relationship it has to different problems our Nation is fac-
ing. 
The  Joint  Economic  Committee  has  recently  undertaken  the 
work of exploring the connection between opportunity and social 
capital. And it has found that opportunity is largely dependent on 
social capital available to us through the relationships we have 
with our families, neighbors, fellow congregants, and coworkers. 
These relationships are crucial both to our economic opportuni-
ties and our opportunity for producing and sustaining a vibrant, 
healthy, meaningful community life. 
And so the goal of the Joint Economic Committee is now to craft 
policies rooted in social capital, policies that will expand oppor-
tunity for all Americans by strengthening families, communities, 
and civil society in general. 
This undertaking will of course not be without its challenges. 
After all, social capital is not something we can see, or touch, or 
smell. We cannot even directly measure it. We almost do not have 
the vocabulary or the tools to do it. 
In  addition  to  these  difficulties  associated  with  measuring  it, 
there are also some real significant difficulties in establishing its 
causal importance. And while policy can certainly help promote the 
bases for a flourishing civil society within our culture, we must also 
inevitably  confront  its  limits  and  determine  when,  whether,  to 
what extent, and in what way the Federal Government has a part 
to play in this project, and the extent to which the Federal Govern-
ment might be inflicting harm on these institutions. 
To bound the types of policies under consideration, and based on 
the past two years of research, the Project has identified five broad 
goals related to opportunity: making it more affordable to raise a 
family; increasing how many children are raised by happily mar-
ried couples; connecting more people to work; improving the effec-
tiveness of investments in youth and young adults; and rebuilding 
civil society. 
Our  distinguished  panelists  will  help  us  shed  light  on  these 
issues and these questions today, and I look forward to hearing 
their  testimony,  and  also  to  seeing  the  fruits  of  our  discussion 
going forward. 
I now recognize Senator Hassan for her opening remarks.

missions for the Record on page 38.] 
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARGARET WOOD HASSAN, A 
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE 
Senator Hassan. Well, thank you Chairman Lee, and thank you 
for holding a hearing in which we can examine innovative ways to 
increase  economic  opportunity  in  all  of  our  communities.  And  I 
want to thank all of the witnesses for being here with us today. 
I want to focus today on how we can create opportunity for entre-
preneurs by increasing their access to social connections and per-
sonal networks or, in other words, by helping build their social cap-
ital.  Entrepreneurs  frequently  use  their  personal  connections  to 
identify business opportunities, find community mentors, and se-
cure the capital that they need to launch and grow their startups. 
However, not everyone starts off with connections to the business 
community.  And  entrepreneurs  outside  these  informal  networks 
can find it harder to access vital resources like financial counseling 
and  capital  investment.  This  presents  particular  challenges  for 
women entrepreneurs. 
Last year the National Women’s Business Council issued a report 
that found that women’s personal networks have fewer connections 
with ties to resources like financial capital. This is also an acutely 
important issue for entrepreneurs in rural areas of my State. In 
rural areas, there is often extremely limited access to high-quality, 
affordable broadband internet, which is an absolute necessity for 
any business hoping to compete in the modern economy. 
Limited broadband access slows entrepreneurship and contrib-
utes to the so-called ‘‘brain drain,’’ a problem for rural areas that 
I know, Mr. Chairman, you focused on in a report on social capital 
released just last week by this Committee. 
Fortunately  there  are  successful  initiatives  that  Congress  can 
build on. In New Hampshire, we have many nonprofit organiza-
tions and business incubators that are leveraging community inter-
est  and  Federal  investments  to  build  social  capital  for  entre-
preneurs from all walks of life. 
New Hampshire’s Small Business Development Center provides 
business advertising and mentorship, for example. Our Regional 
Development Corporations provide business-gap financing, and we 
have start-up accelerators that tailor their services in innovative 
ways. So there are many programs already underway in the Gran-
ite State that can serve as models for our efforts to expand oppor-
tunity for entrepreneurs, and I expect that there are models in lots 
of other states, as well. 
In my view, having the opportunity to start and grow a business 
should not be all about ‘‘who you know.’’ Equality of opportunity for 
entrepreneurs should be predicated on a willingness to work hard 
to transform an innovative idea into a reality. The bottom line is 
that we have to do more to level the playing field and help aspiring 
business owners build social capital. 
Our country was founded on the idea that nurturing the talent 
and energy of every person promotes human dignity and ignites a 
vibrant and competitive economy. And government certainly has a 
role in ensuring that we do just that.

When we bring people in from the margins, our communities, our 
democracy, and our economy all benefit. We thrive and we build a 
stronger future for our children. 
So I look forward to our witnesses’ testimony today on how we 
can help all Americans build social capital. Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Hassan appears in the Sub-
missions for the Record on page 38.] 
Chairman Lee. Thank you, Senator Hassan. 
I would now like to introduce our distinguished witnesses and 
thank all of you today for being here with us. 
First we have Dr. Nathaniel Hendren, Professor of Economics at 
Harvard University, and Founding Co-Director of Opportunity In-
sights. His work has documented the extent of equality of oppor-
tunity across a range of domains, from the inability of individuals 
to purchase insurance, to the difficulties faced by low-income chil-
dren seeking upward mobility. And, more recently, the disparities 
in intergenerational mobility experienced by children of different 
races. 
Welcome, Dr. Hendren. 
Next we have Dr. Ryan Streeter, who is the Director of Domestic 
Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, where he over-
sees research in education, American citizenship, politics, public 
opinion, and social and cultural studies. 
Before joining AEI, he was the Executive Director of the Center 
for Politics and Governance at the University of Texas at Austin. 
Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Streeter. 
Next we have Mr. Jose Quin˜onez, the Founder and CEO of Mis-
sion  Asset  Fund,  an  award-winning  nonprofit  organization  that 
helps financially excluded communities to participate in the main-
stream U.S. financial system. He has received a number of honors 
and  awards  for  his  work,  including  the  2013  Irvine  Leadership 
Award, and was nominated for the San Francisco Chronicle’s 2019 
Visionary of The Year. Welcome, Mr. Quin˜onez. 
And we have Dr. Patrick Sharkey, Professor and Chair of the De-
partment of Sociology at New York University, teaching courses in 
urban policy, criminology, statistics, and violence. He is also Sci-
entific Director at the Crime Lab of New York. He has authored 
a number of books, including the award-winning ‘‘Stuck in Place: 
Urban  Neighborhoods  and  the  End  of  Progress  Toward  Racial 
Equality.’’ Thank you for being here, Dr. Sharkey. 
We are all very grateful that you are here, and we will give each 
of you now an opportunity to present your testimony. We will start 
with you, Dr. Hendren, and move forward in the order in which 
you were introduced. 
STATEMENT  OF  DR.  NATHANIEL  HENDREN,  PROFESSOR  OF 
ECONOMICS  AND  FOUNDING  CO-DIRECTOR  OF  OPPOR-
TUNITY INSIGHTS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY, CAMBRIDGE, MA 
Dr. Hendren. Thank you. So I do have some presented slides. 
I do not know if it is possible to show them on the screen. If it is, 
feel free. And if there is a clicker for the slides, I would be de-
lighted to use it. If not, I would be happy to just roll—alright.

Alright. So thank you for the opportunity to be here to talk with 
you today. I think, like many of us, I grew up inspired by the no-
tion of the American Dream, this idea that every child should have 
an opportunity to climb that income ladder. In my research, with 
a broad set of collaborators, we try to measure the extent to which 
we live up to this ideal. 
Unfortunately, our research shows that this dream is simply out 
of reach for too many children. There are many ways of quantifying 
the American Dream, but one way to measure it is to ask what 
fraction of children grow up to earn more than their parents in 
adulthood. 
Now we find that for children born in 1940, the American Dream 
was nearly a guarantee. Ninety percent of those kids grew up to 
earn more than their parents. But today, only half of children grow 
up to earn more than their parents. 
Now another measure of the American Dream is the likelihood 
that a child born at the bottom of the income distribution grows up 
to reach the top regions of the income distribution—sort of the abil-
ity to go from rags to riches. 
Now if incomes in adulthood were perfectly independent of one’s 
background, we would expect that 20 percent of those with low-in-
come parents would grow up to reach the top fifth of the income 
distribution in adulthood. But in the U.S., only 7.5 percent of chil-
dren whose parents are in the bottom fifth of the income distribu-
tion grow up to reach the top fifth of the income distribution. 
Now perhaps perfect mobility of 20 percent is too high of a stand-
ard. Another benchmark is to think about comparing across coun-
tries. Here again, the U.S. lags behind. In the UK, 9 percent of 
children  grow  up  to  reach  the  top  fifth  from  low-income  back-
grounds; 11.7 percent in Denmark; 13.5 percent from Canada; and 
15.7 percent in Sweden. 
Now this broad pattern in the U.S. masks the fact that there are 
places in the United States where the American Dream is alive and 
well. Rates of upward mobility vary dramatically across the coun-
try, and even within cities. In some neighborhoods—for example, in 
Provo, Utah—children from low-income families grow up to earn 
$66,000 on average at age 35. In contrast, low-income children who 
grow up in parts of inner Baltimore with parents of the same in-
come background, earn on average only $16,000 in adulthood. 
Now upward mobility varies even more when we compare across 
neighborhoods within cities. As we have documented in The Oppor-
tunity Atlas, children who grow up just a few miles apart in fami-
lies  with  comparable  incomes  have  very  different  later-life  out-
comes. 
For example, children who grow up in some parts of Provo, Utah, 
earn just $30,000 a year on average, less than half of their counter-
parts at $66,000. Or to take another example in Midtown Manhat-
tan where poor children growing up on either side of Third Avenue 
earn either $28,000 a year or $45,000 a year on average in adult-
hood. 
And so these striking disparities raise the natural question: Why 
do  outcomes  differ  so  dramatically  across  places  in  the  United 
States? Now our results suggest that the outcomes we see today of

people in adulthood have their roots in the neighborhood environ-
ments in which these children grew up. 
Every year a child spends growing up in a neighborhood with 
higher rates of upward mobility increases their income in adult-
hood. 
And so the message is simple. Neighborhoods matter. Where we 
grow up shapes our outcomes in adulthood. If we can improve the 
neighborhood environments for children, especially for those who 
are most disadvantaged among us, we can increase upper mobility 
in the United States. The variation in The Opportunity Atlas we 
believe provides a learning opportunity that can inform such efforts 
where we can attempt to replicate the successes of places with high 
rates of upward mobility. 
Now across the U.S., we do see that places with higher rates of 
upward mobility tend to be places where children are growing up 
in neighborhoods with lower poverty rates, stronger measures of 
school quality, stronger family structures, and stronger measures of 
social capital. 
I do want to be clear today. While we can identify the character-
istics of neighborhoods that tend to promote high rates of upward 
mobility, current limitations prevent us from identifying the best 
policies for improving upward mobility. And to that aim, I look for-
ward to an extensive discussion. 
And I am excited about our ongoing endeavors and collaborations 
on our end with researchers at the Census Bureau and Treasury 
Department to further understand these potential pathways to pro-
moting upward mobility. Uncovering the recipe for success will not 
be easy, but thanks to access to administrative data and support 
of government research I do believe we can make progress on this 
important question. 
And more generally, I am delighted to be here today to discuss 
how we might learn from evidence to inform policies that might im-
prove upward mobility. And while I know there is a lot of disagree-
ment in policies, it is my hope and belief that an evidence-based 
approach to improving upward mobility and opportunity for all of 
our children as its purpose expands party lines and allows us to 
begin to restore the American Dream. So thank you for letting me 
be here today.

Dr. Streeter. Thank you, Chairman Lee, Senator Hassan, and 
members of the Committee, for asking us to come and testify today 
on  the  important  relationship  between  social  capital  and  oppor-
tunity in America. 
Through several decades of research, we know that social capital 
positively affects a wide range of things that we all care about and 
desire, such as good work, happy family lives, a good education, 
safety for our kids, and opportunity for us and others. Yet we do

not utilize what we have learned about social capital very effec-
tively in domestic policymaking anymore. 
And before explaining what I mean by that and talking about 
policy, I would like to share some relevant data points from our re-
search at the American Enterprise Institute on social capital in 
America. 
The benefits of social capital are especially interesting when we 
look at how the informal elements of social capital such as talking 
with and getting together with neighbors and friends, and formal 
elements such as volunteering in civic groups, relate to one another 
and other things that we care about. 
Consider the following: 46 percent of people who are both highly 
civic and highly social rate the communities where they live as ‘‘ex-
cellent’’ compared to 36 percent of people who are highly social but 
not very civically engaged in their communities. People who are 
highly civic and social are the least likely to say they would move 
away from their community if they could. They are more attached 
to where they live than others. 
When you ask people if they get a strong sense of community 
from their neighborhood, highly civic people are more likely to say 
yes, compared with people who are just highly social. 
Social people with lots of friends are very happy, but those who 
are also civically engaged are even happier still. People who are 
civically engaged but not especially social are more likely to report 
never  feeling  lonely  than  people  who  are  very  social  but  not 
civically engaged. I could go on. But suffice it to say that America’s 
health is greatly enhanced city by city by those who embrace their 
communities out of a sense of responsibility. 
To think about the future of social capital in public policy, it is 
worth taking a look at the past. We know so much more about the 
benefits of social capital today, thanks to the research of people like 
Dr.  Hendren  and  others,  than  we  did  in  the  mid-1990s,  but 
strangely we incorporate these ideas less today when we are de-
signing policy solutions. 
For example, from 1991 to 1996 we saw four major domestic pol-
icy reforms at the Federal and State levels that all presupposed the 
indispensable value of basic units of civil society: family, neighbor-
hood, community, in their very policy design. Each understood in 
its own ways that civic and social networks were important ele-
ments of policy success. 
The first reform was in school policy which began in Milwaukee 
in 1990 with the first voucher law, and in Minnesota in 1991 with 
the  first  charter  law,  and  then  rippled  across  the  country.  The 
premise of the school reform movement was to empower parents 
and families to either form their own schools in cooperation with 
community leaders or have the ultimate choice in where their kids 
went to school. Empowering civically minded school reformers was 
central to the movement’s success. 
The second reform concerns public housing, which in city after 
city had become a symbol of failed policy riddled with crime, drugs, 
and persistent poverty. HOPE VI, which Congress created in 1992, 
made the neighborhood rather than a simple unit of housing the 
central focus of public housing assistance.

Housing projects were torn down and replaced with mixed-in-
come,  sometimes  mixed-use,  developments  that  gave  families  in 
public housing a greater stake in their neighborhood—or at least 
that was the intention. 
The  third  reform  is  community  policing,  which  predates  the 
1990s, but it was a Federal law in 1994 that effectively made it a 
nationwide practice. 
In the 10 years after the law passed, the share of municipal po-
lice departments’ practicing community policing grew from about 
20 percent to 68 percent. Today, 80 percent of police departments 
practice community policing, which replaces command and control 
crime response with crime prevention, rooted in neighborhood level 
partnerships. 
Fourth, and perhaps the best known, is welfare reform which 
was created in 1996 amidst quite a bit of public debate. Most of the 
debate then, as now, was focused on the merits of work require-
ments and the time limits on welfare recipients. 
Less debated, but just as important, was the positive effect expe-
rienced by states that devolved responsibility for work outcomes to 
the municipal level. Where that happened, local leaders stepped up 
and took ownership for helping people find work, with generally 
impressive results. 
If we hope to continue to make progress serving individuals and 
families struggling to fully participate in the American economy, 
we need to focus on the centrality of community relationships once 
again. 
Whatever the merits of our current debates on a range of issues 
from subsidizing wages or making college less expensive, or even 
free, and so on, if we fail to recognize the important role that net-
works play at the local and regional levels in people’s upward mo-
bility prospects, our national debates about these former types of 
policy will achieve limited impact. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF MR. JOSE A. QUIN˜ONEZ, FOUNDER AND CEO, 
MISSION ASSET FUND, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 
Mr. Quin˜onez. Thank you, Chairman Lee, Senator Hassan, and 
members of the Joint Economic Committee, for having this impor-
tant hearing. My name is Jose Quin˜onez. I am an immigrant. I 
came to this country in the dark of night as a 9-year-old. I adjusted 
my status under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. 
I became a U.S. Citizen and now I am living my American Dream 
of helping low-income people become visible, active, and successful 
in the marketplace. 
As the CEO of the Mission Asset Fund, a nonprofit organization 
based in San Francisco, I have first-hand experience at addressing 
the daunting financial challenges our clients face every day. And 
what I have learned is this: Being poor in America is expensive, 
particularly for people living outside of the financial mainstream. 
Nationally, one in seven Latinos are unbanked, meaning they do 
not  have  checking  accounts,  or  savings  accounts.  And  while  re-

searchers point to various reasons for why people go without ac-
counts, we know banks exclude people based on immigration sta-
tus, or by requiring narrow forms of IDs. Consequently, many of 
our clients are left unbanked and without a choice but to rely on 
alternative providers that charge more to cash checks or pay bills. 
The  average  household—under-served  household  that  earns 
$25,000 annually—pays about 10 percent of that income on fees 
and interest for financial services that those of us with bank ac-
counts often get for free. 
Lack  of  credit  is  a  challenge.  Nationally  nearly  one  in  three 
Latinos are credit-invisible, meaning they do not have credit scores 
or credit reports. And given the nature of our economy, there is lit-
tle anyone can do without credit. People cannot get loans to buy 
homes,  start  businesses;  they  cannot  rent  apartments;  in  some 
states they cannot even get jobs without employers checking their 
credit reports. And without access to credit, affordable credit, peo-
ple turn to high-cost lenders, some paying 100 percent APRs on 
small-dollar  loans,  and  significantly  more  for  short-term  payday 
loans. 
Barriers to economic mobility are not just financial. People are 
also burdened with uncertainty from the current anti-immigrant 
political climate, fearing losing their families and draining their 
savings. Many worry about being detained for lack of documenta-
tion, igniting a financial crisis. Bail alone can strip them of $5,000. 
Obtaining legal representation, up to $20,000. And the costs mount 
from there. 
So how can we help people realize their potential when they are 
financially invisible and also facing enormous challenges in their 
lives? We found answers in how our clients leverage social capital: 
their relationships with family and friends in order to survive and 
thrive. 
Our clients practice a time-honored tradition of lending and sav-
ing money together. It is an activity known by a hundred different 
names the world over, but which is essentially the same. A group 
of people come together and agree to pool their money so that one 
member of the group can take the lump sum. And they do it again 
on a weekly or monthly basis until everyone in the group has had 
a chance of getting the lump sum. 
So when people do not have access to loans, this is how they cre-
ate their own, using their word and trust. We built our lending 
serving program on this tradition. We formalize loans by having 
participants sign promissory notes which MAF then services and 
reports to credit bureaus. Since launching the program in 2008, we 
have made over 11,000 loans to help participants build credit. In 
fact, they see an average increase of 168 points, opening a world 
of possibilities for them in the credit market. And the repayment 
rate is 99.3 percent, an unheard-of rate in the micro lending world. 
Lending Circles is an example of what we could do with and for 
people if we designed programs and policies for success based on 
people’s strengths and social capital to create lasting change. 
But despite the promise of this approach, it is not enough to help 
the millions of people that are still trapped with barriers that di-
minish their economic potential.

We need better data to understand people’s challenges. Research 
reports based on national data sets often ignore those who are fi-
nancially invisible, thereby missing critical segments of our society. 
Congress can also remove asset limits to further benefit programs 
like SNAP that are a lifeline for families not earning enough to 
make ends meet. 
Congress could also provide clarity that U.S. citizenship is not a 
prerequisite  for  accessing  financial  services,  and  allow  for  more 
government-issued IDs when opening accounts. Congress could also 
significantly  reduce  the  number  of  credit-invisibles  by  allowing 
positive payment data from utilities, rent, and telecoms to be in-
cluded in credit reports. And Congress can require ability to repay 
underwriting standards, and longer repayment terms for small-dol-
lar and payday loans. 
I believe these reforms can go a long way in unlocking people’s 
economic potentials and help them realize their American Dreams, 
too. So thank you for holding this hearing, and I look forward to 
the conversation.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  PATRICK  SHARKEY,  PROFESSOR  AND 
CHAIR OF THE SOCIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, NEW YORK UNI-
VERSITY, NEW YORK, NY 
Dr. Sharkey. Thank you, Chairman Lee, Senator Hassan, and 
the members of the Committee. I will focus my comments on a 
basic  question  to  the  study  of  social  capital:  How  do  we  build 
stronger communities? 
Let me first give a sense of the problem we are facing. Several 
decades of evidence, which has been bolstered by the work of Dr. 
Hendren and his collaborators, has led to a clear conclusion: Neigh-
borhoods in which children are raised play a central role in influ-
encing  their  academic  achievement,  their  cognitive  development, 
their physical and mental well-being, and their economic mobility. 
Labor market opportunities, environmental hazards, the quality 
of institutions like schools, libraries, financial institutions, police 
departments, vary dramatically depending on where one lives, cre-
ating a rigid geography of vulnerability and opportunity. And the 
problem is multi-generational. The vast majority of children who 
currently reside in poor neighborhoods are from families that have 
lived in similarly poor neighborhoods for multiple generations. So 
we know, the evidence tells us, that the consequences of living in 
highly disadvantaged neighborhoods are cumulative, with long-last-
ing effects that persist across generations. 
There are good reasons to think that this link between our com-
munities and our life chances is growing stronger. As income in-
equality in the Nation as a whole has increased, economic segrega-
tion has grown. Meaning, the rich and the poor are increasingly 
likely to live apart, sorting into separate communities. 
Inequality  between  cities  and  regions  is  also  growing.  While 
many coastal and sunbelt cities like New York and San Diego have 
attracted newcomers with higher income, better education, other

sections of the country, rustbelt cities like Detroit and Cleveland, 
have seen higher income, better educated residents leave. 
As a result, metropolitan areas have begun to look more and 
more different from each other, some with bustling economies offer-
ing relatively high-wage jobs, others isolated from economic oppor-
tunity. And as this type of regional inequality has increased, long- 
range geographic mobility, the kind of mobility that has always 
served as a way to allow Americans to take advantage of new op-
portunities in new places, has fallen, particularly for the less ad-
vantaged segments of the population: racial and ethnic minorities, 
people with less education. 
This is the challenge that faces America’s neighborhoods. Now 
how did we get to this point? As urban economies began to shift 
starting in the 1940s and 1950s and all the way through the 1980s, 
a set of social problems like joblessness, segregation, pollution, and 
poverty became concentrated in central cities. 
Our response was not a sustained national project of investment 
to respond to these challenges. Instead, our response was to aban-
don central cities, to withdraw resources, and to provide ways for 
the most advantaged segments of the population to leave central 
cities and to head to the suburbs. 
As the share of city budgets from Federal sources plummeted, 
public housing deteriorated, public schools crumbled, fiscal condi-
tions  worsened,  neighborhoods  emptied  out,  institutions  like 
churches  and  community  organizations  withered  away.  This  is 
what happens when communities are abandoned. If we want to 
build stronger communities, we need to shift from a model of aban-
donment to a model of community investment. In the American En-
terprise Institute’s Survey on Community and Society, a national 
sample of respondents was asked what makes a community suc-
cessful? The responses are revealing. 
The two top responses were: good local schools and having librar-
ies and community centers nearby. A great deal of evidence sug-
gests that the respondents are on the right track. The most effec-
tive way to build stronger communities is to invest in core public 
institutions like schools and libraries that bring people together in 
shared spaces, and in local organizations, including faith-based or-
ganizations,  community  development  corporations,  prisoner  re- 
entry programs, childcare providers, mentorship and after-school 
programs, organizations like the Mission Asset Fund that provide 
the foundation for every community making them less vulnerable 
to the next crisis to hit America’s neighborhoods. Thank you for 
bringing us together. This is a great group of speakers, and I look 
forward to your questions. 
[The prepared statement of Dr. Sharkey appears in the Submis-
sions for the Record on page 52.] 
Chairman Lee. Thank you very much. We will now begin the 
five-minute question rounds. I will go first, followed by Senator 
Hassan, and then we will alternate Republican and Democrat in 
order of arrival at the hearing. 
Dr. Hendren, I will start with you. You mentioned my home town 
of Provo, Utah, in your testimony today, and you have listed Utah 
communities as among the most upwardly mobile in some of your 
writings.

Now in my experience, there’s a Moscow in Idaho, there is a Lon-
don in Kentucky, there is even a Newark in Delaware, but there 
is no other ‘‘Provo.’’ Nonetheless, there are some communities like 
Provo where upward economic mobility is possible. What is it that 
you found in your research that differentiates Provo and commu-
nities like it from other communities where you do not see that 
kind of social capital and economic opportunity? 
Dr. Hendren. Well thanks for the question. So I will preface 
this by saying I have not actually been to Provo, Utah, so I will—— 
Chairman Lee. That’s a shame. You need to remedy that. 
[Laughter.] 
Dr. Hendren. But what I will say is, when we look broadly 
across the U.S. in places like Provo that have some of the highest 
rates of upward mobility, what we find is really the four character-
istics that I mentioned  in  my testimony. It  is  places that have 
strong schools. It is places that have less residential segregation 
and less income inequality. Places that have stronger measures of 
social capital. And places with stronger family structures. 
Now what is it about a place in particular that drives its high 
rates of upward mobility? That is a question to which we do not 
know the exact answer. But in a place like Utah, the ways of meas-
uring social capital, two things sort of come to mind. It is a place 
where a wide range of social capital measures score highly. There 
is a high fraction of religious populations there, and in the U.S. 
more broadly we see that places that have a higher fraction of peo-
ple who are religious, we do see higher rates of upward mobility. 
We also see in places that have people that return their Census 
forms have higher rates of upward mobility—speaking to some of 
that civic engagement. And so I think you phrased it right, that 
what we see is something amorphous that is hard to really put a 
finger on what exactly is driving the high rates of upward mobility, 
but what we can say is there are these characteristics that do cor-
relate more broadly across the U.S. 
Chairman Lee. I found it interesting when you mentioned in 
your written testimony that there are some poor neighborhoods in 
Provo where children raised in those neighborhoods, by the time 
they are 35 earn $60,000–$65,000 a year. There are other neighbor-
hoods where that is not the case. 
Are these same correlators present or absent in one neighborhood 
or  the  other?  Are  those  the  same  things  that  differentiate  one 
neighborhood within the same town as one town from another? 
Dr. Hendren. Yeah, exactly. And I think it comes back to the 
statements earlier. Across the U.S., metro areas that have a higher 
degree of things like residential segregation, or lower measures of 
social capital, have lower rates of upper mobility on average. 
When you zoom in within a locality, what you find is the children 
growing up in the segregated neighborhoods tend to have lower 
rates of upward mobility. Or, in places where measures of social 
capital are lower, those are places that have lower rates of upward 
mobility even within cities, if that makes sense. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you. That is helpful. 
Dr. Streeter, in recent years there has been really rapid growth 
in technology. You know, we have seen the rise of the iPhone, Twit-
ter, other social media platforms, and those are things that have

in  some  ways  enabled  easier  communication  between  people.  It 
connects one person to a whole lot of other people. 
But it has also been argued that the same technologies might de-
grade—might  undermine  people’s  ability  to  access  an  education, 
and also interfere with somebody’s ability or inclination to have 
personal interactions with someone else. 
I heard from one—the president of a large university recently. 
She told me that as people have become more accustomed to learn-
ing  things  by  YouTube  and  through  Google  searches,  students 
today, even highly performing students in terms of their entering 
test scores and high school GPA, sometimes do not like to memo-
rize because they consider it useless. That is one of many ways in 
which it is changing the way people learn. 
But what do you think about the potential effects of technology 
on social capital formation? 
Dr. Streeter. Well I would start out by saying there is a lot that 
we still do not know about the effect of technology on social capital. 
And  there  is  some  evidence  that  increased  screen  time  among 
younger people on their phones correlates pretty strongly with in-
creased incidences of self-reported mood disorders, depression, and 
the like. 
There is some evidence that that is the case. What I would say 
is that from our own survey work we found that people who regu-
larly interact with people that they consider close friends and fam-
ily are generally less lonely and happier. And the more friends that 
you have, the less lonely you are. That might seem to make sense. 
What we found through our own survey research is that, when 
people use digital technology to communicate with friends on a reg-
ular basis, that is like interacting often face to face. Now there is 
nothing quite like joining together in a room and solving problems 
together. We all know from experience there is something very val-
uable there. 
We know that when people are concentrated in well-functioning 
neighborhoods that social capital has benefits, for the reasons that 
have been articulated here. But I think one thing to help maybe 
mitigate some of our worry and concern about the increased screen 
time, when you walk into a room and your kids are there and they 
are all on their phones and they are not looking up at you, there 
is something wrong with that—and I think there is evidence to 
suggest that we are seeing problems, particularly among teenagers, 
that are related to that phenomenon. 
However, I also think, from our own work, we see that, when 
people are in regular communication with people they are close to, 
whether that is texting, or on phone calls, or using other social 
media, it helps sustain those relationships and it helps people feel 
less lonely. So there is reason to be optimistic that some of this so-
cial media technology actually can help us do things together. 
And if you actually just examine some of your own interactions, 
think about people you are close to and how you stay in touch with 
them—I have a daughter that is in school in the UK. I thought 
SnapChat  was  terrible  when  I  heard  about  it,  when  it  was  in-
vented, but now I love it. It is a way for me to have visibility into 
her life every day. I think a lot of people can identify with that.

I have a closeness that is enabled through that technology that 
I did not have before it existed. And our survey data shows that 
there is reason to be optimistic that that actually does help keep 
us more closely connected with people that we love and care about. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you. 
Senator Hassan. 
Senator  Hassan.  Well  thank  you  again,  Mr.  Chair,  for  con-
vening this panel. And thank you again to the panelists for your 
testimony. 
Dr. Hendren, I would like to ask you about the research you and 
your Harvard colleagues published in 2014 on the factors that im-
pact the future economic mobility of children across the country. 
Because in my view, the defining aspect of the American Dream is 
the ability of parents to expect that their children will have a bet-
ter future, a more prosperous future, than they had. 
In your study, you single out social capital and you mention that 
some of the characteristics of social capital are somewhat amor-
phous. You also said that important factors in increasing a child’s 
economic opportunities include school quality, income inequality, 
racial segregation, and family structure. And that those factors also 
impact  future  economic  mobility,  and  I  would  suggest  they  are 
somewhat less amorphous. They are measurable. Can you tell the 
Committee about how these other major factors I just referenced, 
such as school quality, also impact a child’s future economic oppor-
tunities? And also, do these factors mutually reinforce and interact 
with one another? For example, do neighborhoods with both higher- 
quality  schooling  and  more  social  capital  provide  greater  future 
economic mobility for children? 
Dr. Hendren. Great. Thanks for the question. So you are correct 
that broadly we find five factors that correlate with upward mobil-
ity: school quality, income inequality, social capital, strength of the 
family structure, and poverty rates. 
In terms of school quality in particular, the ways in which we 
measure school quality are broad and vast, and I agree there are 
many ways to measure it. So you can look at 3rd grade or 8th 
grade test scores of students on State exams in places or in neigh-
borhoods that have stronger scores on those exams, and particular 
scores by low-income students you see higher rates of upward mo-
bility. 
In places that have less residential segregation, either on the 
race dimension or the income dimension, you see higher rates of 
upward mobility. And to get to your last question, it looks like 
these five factors are in a sense additive across the U.S. Each fac-
tor seems to correlate with higher rates of upward mobility condi-
tionally on the other factors as well. And so in places that have 
both high—strong schools and more two-parent households, those 
neighborhoods tend to have higher rates of upward mobility. 
Senator Hassan. Thank you. Mr. Quin˜onez, I would like to ask 
you about an important issue you raise in your essay, ‘‘Latinos in 
the Financial Shadows.’’ You point out that, as online banking be-
comes more mainstream, some families may lose access to bank 
representatives, such as tellers or other employees who help them 
navigate the financial system.

This is an especially important concern in New Hampshire where 
many  of  my  constituents  also  lack  access  to  quality,  affordable 
broadband internet. So on the one hand you have fewer human 
beings to interact with and help navigate the financial system, and 
on the other hand you also have people who really do not have ac-
cess to the online banking functions, as well. So fewer bank store-
fronts and inadequate broadband access can make building credit 
a real challenge. One way to fill this gap in service, as you say in 
your essay, is for community nonprofits to partner with financial 
institutions and to provide families with financial advice. 
How do you think community relationships between nonprofits 
and financial institutions can help fill gaps between storefront and 
online banking services? And how can Congress support and en-
courage these relationships? 
Mr. Quin˜onez. Thank you so much for that question. I think it 
goes back to the question of being present, being there. Because as 
those bank branches are starting to close—and not just banks, but 
credit unions are beginning to close all over the country—they are 
not present in those communities anymore. So those institutions 
are going to be lacking. 
And so I am just lifting up the fact that there are nonprofit orga-
nizations. There are faith-based organizations in those locations, as 
well. So there is another way for us to sort of interact and provide 
them with the tools and resources so that they can be the front fac-
ing relationship bridge between what people are experiencing in 
terms of the hardships, or even advice and suggestions, so that 
they can continue moving on with their economic lives. 
So I believe the nonprofits could play a key role there, but that 
has not been part of the conversation just yet. So in that particular 
essay, I was just like here are the organizations that are already 
in those communities, we can figure out how to either provide them 
with resources or maybe connect them more closely with financial 
institutions, so that as they close those branches those nonprofits 
can actually step in and provide more of those services there. 
Senator Hassan. Well thank you very much. And I appreciate 
all of you being here today very much. I had a question that I will 
ask for the record, in which I will ask you all to help us prioritize 
steps we could take to encourage and grow social capital in our 
communities, and address some of the issues you have all identi-
fied. Thank you all for your very important work.

Members of the House have a—we represent communities that 
unfortunately change every 10 years. So we have kind of artificially 
created districts that are many times kind of drawn together in a 
very interesting way. 
My District has 15 communities that surround an airport. So you 
have an economic driver. Then you have 15 communities. Many of 
those communities share school districts. So you do not have 15 dif-
ferent school districts, but it has a great diversity of—racial diver-
sity, and great economic diversity. 
Over the period of 10 years, most people think that these kind 
of changes come over decades. But in our environment, the subur-

ban environment that we live in, these districts evolved very quick-
ly. So in our area, we have had a—because it’s a corporate atmos-
phere around the airport, and because of the airport the population 
growth has tended to bring in a very high earner into the commu-
nity, while the community stays pretty much the same. But it’s 
making those that were there before the hirees arrived, actually 
pushing them into a lower economic strata. 
And of course when the school districts grow at that level, it 
forces them to rezone the schools on a regular basis. So that when 
you  begin  to  rezone  the  schools,  you  zone  it  more  towards  the 
neighborhood. The neighborhood then pretty much throws diversity 
kind of out the window because it’s looking for proximities. So you 
end up with very stratified racial school district zones where you 
have less diversity among the students learning together. 
And my question is: When you look at a situation like that, is 
the question of school choice more important? Is the question of a 
district evolving from 90 percent homeowners to 50 percent apart-
ment dwellers now because the corporations are bringing in work-
ers that are not going to live there long. They are staying in an 
apartment. They are not as connected to the community. So this is 
becoming, across the Nation, as big a problem as these old strati-
fied neighborhoods that are slowly declining, but you have districts 
that are kind of exploding as far as these problems go. 
Dr. Streeter? Dr. Hendren? Any of you that would like to com-
ment on that, I would appreciate it. 
Dr. Streeter. Just to one part of your remarks and question. I 
do think that what is driving this is an interrelation of a couple 
of complex things, right. And so I will not diagnose those all en-
tirely, although I have some things to say there, and I know the 
others here are more qualified than I am to talk about that. But 
I do think in that environment, allowing flexibility with where fam-
ilies can send their children to school is an important thing. I think 
having  options—that  competitive  pressure  that  happens  when 
there is a competitive educational marketplace—is generally a good 
thing. I think it has been good just a few blocks from here. You 
can  visit  neighborhoods  that  have  benefited  where  traditional 
schools and charters and et cetera have benefited from that kind 
of competition. 
I do think that the challenges for this sort of sorting and seg-
regation that happens by income at the regional level is driven 
very much by local choices. And I think the tools available to Fed-
eral policymakers on some of these things are actually quite lim-
ited. 
I think that, when it comes to how zoning is done and the way 
that  neighborhoods  are  sort  of  constructed,  that  is  driven  very 
much by local and State policy. And I think that right now is driv-
ing a lot of these factors that we see in terms of inequality by geog-
raphy. 
Dr. Hendren. Yeah, I think that you raise tough questions. I 
think when it comes to zoning and other policies that are tradition-
ally done at a local level, the only thing that I would be able to

up in those neighborhoods tend to be higher in places where kids 
from different backgrounds tend to grow up together. 
And so thinking about the types of policies, the ways in which 
policy interacts with those incentives, is what I would say is impor-
tant. But exactly how to turn that into local policy or regulations 
about local policy, I do not have a strong view at this time. 
Dr. Sharkey. If I could just add one last comment on that, you 
are describing the growing phenomenon of economic segregation. 
High- and low-income people living nearby in the same area, but 
living in different communities. And the reason it becomes impor-
tant  is  because,  as  neighborhoods  become  more  and  more  seg-
regated, investment in different communities becomes more and 
more unequal. 
So, you know, there are steps to take. A, if there is affordable 
housing in every neighborhood around the airports and in every 
neighborhood within your district, then you will have some level of 
economic segregation and schools will become more integrated as 
well. But the key is that if there are investments, if there are core 
organizations in every single neighborhood, then the consequences 
of that kind of economic segregation become less severe. 
Chairman Lee. Representative Heck. 
Representative Heck. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is my 
inaugural meeting of the JEC. I just want to signal, it is a privilege 
and an honor to join the Committee, and I am very pleased to be 
here. I also want to express my appreciation to the Chair for select-
ing this topic. I think it is an important and very worthwhile use 
of our time. Although my concern is that we would devolve down 
the  track  of  either/or,  either  social  investment  or  social  capital, 
which frankly I think, (a) reminds me of the old beer commercial 
where two people bark at each other, ‘‘less filling,’’ ‘‘tastes great,’’ 
to no end. 
And, frankly, and unfortunately, is emblematic of everything that 
is wrong with this town, the ‘‘either/or’’ stuff. But having said all 
that, it seems to me that we have got a couple of kinds of commu-
nities that are relevant to this conversation: those for whom there 
has been an absence of opportunity for quite some time, it is struc-
tural,  it  is  associated  with  all  the  factors  that  have  been  re-
searched. Dr. Sharkey, Dr. Hendren, racial discrimination and oth-
ers. And then you have other communities where it did not used 
to be that case, but then there is traumatic job loss and it becomes 
the case. 
Everybody has that perspective, whether it is the mining commu-
nity in Appalachia, or the factory town in the Midwest, or in the 
part of the country that Congresswoman Herrera Beutler and I live 
in, the closure of the sawmill where there’s just been this precipi-
tous loss. 
We have some counties in Washington State, for example, that 
have had double-digit unemployment literally for 25 years because 
of the closure of the timber industry, double digit for 25 years. 
And so to me it kind of begs the question, however, with respect 
to social capital. Is it destroyed, demeaned, deluded, by traumatic 
job loss? Dr. Sharkey? Let’s go down the line. 
Dr. Sharkey. Thank you, Representative Heck, for the question. 
It is a great question. I think in sections of the country that have

gone through this kind of economic dislocation, then it set the stage 
for a whole set of additional problems. It sets the stage for the loss 
of social capital that we have all been discussing. 
It is not inevitable, however. I think what destroys communities 
is when there is a combination of this kind of economic shock, or 
long-term economic distress, combined with the absence of a foun-
dation of strong community institutions that are unable to absorb 
people who are unemployed, people who need additional training, 
people who need to go back to school, or who need short-term sup-
port in order to get back on their feet and reintegrate into the labor 
market. 
So it is really this interaction between economic distress and the 
absence of a strong foundation of community institutions that cre-
ates the kind of—— 
Representative Heck. But they affect one another. 
Dr. Sharkey. I think they interact together, exactly. 
Representative Heck. My time is limited, so I guess I want to 
get to my second and last question, Dr. Hendren. A lot of your real-
ly informative research relates to upward mobility and going from 
one income bracket to another. But I am curious as to your reac-
tion about the context here. 
The truth of the matter is, for 40 years about 88 percent of this 
country has been within an income bracket which has not budged. 
Wage stagnation. That is the context. Your research is how do I get 
from here to here, but the fact of the matter is wherever ‘‘here’’ is 
has been flatlined for 40 years. And you did not say anything in 
your testimony, nor am I aware of anything in your research, that 
says how does that context bear upon the upward mobility. 
Dr. Hendren. I thank you for the question, and it is a delight 
to be able to answer that. You are absolutely right that the statis-
tics I quoted on the 7.5 percent of kids from low-income families 
that reached the top of the income distribution is sort of a com-
parative statistic within the income distribution. 
In terms of statistics that capture exactly that phenomenon—— 
Representative Heck. If I may interrupt, as it relates to social 
investment, it is much higher in countries that have greater social 
investment. But I interrupt. Go ahead. 
Dr. Hendren. That is true. When you look across cohorts, people 
who are born in 1940, 90 percent of them grew up to earn more 
than their parents. The reason that is is because we experienced 
broad-based equal growth across the income distribution. 
Today, 50 percent of kids grow up to earn more than their par-
ents. And the exact reason for that, statistically, is exactly the phe-
nomenon you mention, which is that there has not been real wage 
growth at the median of the income distribution. That is simply 
kind of a mathematical restatement of exactly the phenomenon you 
are mentioning. 
So in terms of whether or not kids earn more than their parents, 
that is a direct implication of the statistics you are describing. 
Representative Heck. And if I had more time, we would talk 
a little bit about the importance of the Fed’s monetary policy on 
that fact, and how it is that their over-concern about over-heating 
of the economy has caused them to tap the brakes too rapidly, thus 
suppressing wage growth. Thank you, sir.

Chairman Lee. Thank you. Representative Herrera Beutler. 
Representative Herrera Beutler. Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
This is the busy season here in D.C., but I feel like this is one 
of those conversations that could go over several days, and should, 
quite frankly. Because when I think about the issues at home—you 
know, Representative Heck mentioned West Coast has been deci-
mated in certain areas by the timber industry, and Federal policy, 
quite frankly, but how do we grow back? I am sandwiched between 
Seattle and Portland. I am the great sandwich part in the middle, 
with bones on either ends, but they are struggling with housing 
policy, and it is impacting all of us. 
There is some incredible tragedy taking place because of the im-
pacts on people’s lives, people who are losing their lives. And I 
think this conversation directly relates to how we change that. 
I found it really interesting that you mentioned—you were talk-
ing about—and I have heard it several times now, and Dr. Sharkey 
was talking about, the difference in the strength of the schools, and 
the community foundations, and institutions, the strength of the 
family, and what I keep coming back to is: Well what does that ac-
tually mean? 
You know, I have an idea in my mind. I can tell you, my family— 
my father is of Hispanic heritage, and they grew up very poor and 
had very little; 10 kids in one room, and here I get to sit before 
you today. And it is not because my parents did anything more 
than work hard. And I know that these elements were there, but 
I cannot define it. 
So  how  do  we  define  it?  Is  it—it  is  not  always  money,  and 
schools, you can compare Utah schools to D.C. schools, to other 
schools, and in Washington State we have a lot of school choice, be-
lieve it or not. There are a lot of people who choose—and I think 
this is critical—choose to, whether, we have public home schools in 
Washington State. So there are all these different choices, and I 
think that contributes. But what does it look like? How do we find 
a definition for this? How do we put a more concrete—some con-
crete examples, because I think it is kind of open to everybody, be-
cause  I  think  everybody  had  a  piece,  but  I  would  like  to  hear 
thoughts. 
Mr. Quin˜onez. Thank you for having a broader perspective, or 
any question about that, because I would caution us in trying to 
define ‘‘social capital’’ very narrowly, of only thinking about institu-
tions, because sometimes even those institutions are just vessels 
where relationships actually happen. 
And if anything from my story and the story of MAF, is that poor 
people also have social capital, because they also have relation-
ships. It is based on those relationships that we rely on to survive 
to weather any economic shock, or any political sort of antagonism 
against people. And it is those relationships that really are central 
to the human condition. 
So this is not new, right? This is why people left Africa to start 
migrating  out  and  conquering  the  world,  right,  because  we  had 
those relationships to base it on. So this is not anything new. But 
if we only think of them as being very specific to a very specific 
type of folk, then I think we miss the bigger picture.

And so I think once we start realizing and validating that the re-
lationships that people have to bear, and start doing away with 
policies  that  actually  try  to  break  down  families—I  mean,  you 
know, I mentioned our current political climate. That actually dete-
riorates the social capital within very specific groups of individuals. 
And so it is kind of acknowledging the broader sense of what the 
capital is, and trying to not put up policies that could break up 
families in that process. 
Dr. Streeter. I would also just add to those good comments two 
quick things. From our own work, it is really important that people 
feel like they belong. And I think that is one big element here. 
If you actually have people that you can point to in your lives 
that you can rely on in times of need when things are tough, that 
helps against a whole range of other types of problems. 
So truly lonely people are people not who just have feelings of 
loneliness from time to time, but people who actually do not have 
someone to turn to when they have real needs. We see that pretty 
clearly in our data. 
Secondly, I would say—and thank you, Dr. Sharkey, for referring 
to this earlier in our survey work on community institutions, we 
have another study coming out on this in a few weeks, which I am 
happy to share with your staff, that really does show that when 
you have access to libraries, good schools, the way a community is 
designed, even gyms, even if you do not use the gyms, it turns out, 
when you are close to a range of things that create cohesiveness 
in a community, it is predictable of a lot of things: lower levels of 
loneliness, higher trust in institutions, and the like. 
And I realize that is not a panacea. That is not a response to a 
major economic shock. If a factory closes, or an entire industry 
evaporates from a community, you cannot then say after the fact 
we are going to build these institutions. But it is an argument for 
investing in those institutions in those types of communities now. 
We find this to be true whether it is large cities, suburbs, or 
rural areas. It does not matter what type of municipality you live 
in. It is when you have a density and proximity to those kinds of 
community institutions that actually make a community a commu-
nity that are predictive of a whole bunch of very good things. 
Representative Herrera Beutler. Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
Chairman Lee. Representative Beatty. 
Representative Beatty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank 
you to our panel. And let me also say what an honor it is for me 
to serve on this Committee, not only for a personal reason, but I 
also think it is a good marriage for me, serving on the House Fi-
nancial Services Committee and being Chairwoman of the Diver-
sity and Inclusion Subcommittee, because much of what we are 
doing here is talking about how can we be more inclusive as we 
look at expanding opportunities and making families and commu-
nities in a better position and place to thrive economically. 
I  have  a  great  appreciation  for  all  of  your  research,  your 
writings, and your comments today, and can actually say that I 
liked just about everything that you said. But it gives me pause to 
ask a few questions.

tations prevent us from identifying the best policies for improving

upward mobility. Can you be, quickly, a little more specific about 
what that means? 
Dr. Hendren. Sure. So that is a reference to the fact that, frank-
ly, the way in which the Census is constructed is a repeated cross- 
section survey of people in the population. And at present it is ac-
tually quite difficult to link people over time in that data. 
So as we look at the historical policies that have been imple-
mented in our neighborhoods over the last 50 years, it is actually 
quite difficult to understand the extent to which those policies have 
improved the lives of people in those neighborhoods versus simply 
changed where people live. 
So that was the particular reference I was providing there. 
Representative Beatty. Thank you. All of you presented data 
and information, but it made me, sitting here as an African Amer-
ican female who was not born quite in the 1940s, as you talked 
about the wonderful opportunities of children making more, living 
better than their families. And you all talked about whether it was 
schools,  or  neighborhoods,  or  housing.  It  made  me  feel  like  we 
needed a little history lesson to remind us of Brown v. the Board 
of Education in 1950s, Ruby Bridges in 1960, and in some of those 
Southern states in 1964 and 1965, during my lifetime, you could 
not even vote because of the color of your skin and there was some-
thing called ‘‘red lining.’’ You could not live in communities. 
So here we are today in 2019 basically talking about the same 
things that I heard my parents talking about in the late 1940s and 
in the early 1950s. So here we are. What are your thoughts on the 
effect of the growing income/opportunity gaps? Do you think it pre-
sents a national emergency? We are talking about it here in the 
wonderful Senate on this Committee, but what is the resolve? Are 
we in an emergency nationally? And what should this Committee 
do? Quickly, we are going to go right down the line with you, Dr. 
Sharkey. 
Dr. Sharkey. Sure. It is a great question. Thank you for the 
question, Congresswoman. I think there is a hard answer, okay? 
Representative Beatty. Is it a national emergency? Yes, or no? 
Only so I get through—— 
Dr. Sharkey. The growth in income inequality I think is a na-
tional trend that has very—— 
Representative Beatty. Is it a national emergency? 
Dr. Sharkey. I would say close to yes. 
Representative Beatty. Okay. We’re going to go here, only be-
cause I only have a minute left. 
Mr. Quin˜onez. I say also it is a national emergency, and I also 
brought up the IRCA in 1986 clause as a way of history. 
Representative Beatty. Sure. 
Mr. Quin˜onez. My social capital was realized because of that 
particular legislation. I was able to adjust my status, and I think 
if we do that to the millions of people that are in similar situations 
we can also allow for the social——

Dr. Streeter. It is an emergency in some places, and it is not 
an emergency in other places. But it is an emergency in enough 
places across the country that I do think it is an emergency. And 
I don’t know that that then justifies one sort of national policy re-
sponse. I think in—— 
Representative Beatty. Okay, we are going to get to the next 
part of that after him. 
Dr. Hendren. If calling it a national emergency leads to change, 
I am all for it. 
Representative  Beatty.  And  what  should  that  change  be? 
Three seconds each. Is it legislation? Is it money? 
[Laughter.] 
Only because I have 30 seconds to go. 
Dr. Sharkey. They have got more time than me to prepare. 
Representative Beatty. Come on. 
Dr. Sharkey. I would say invest in communities. Invest in com-
munity institutions. 
Mr. Quin˜onez. I would start with a comprehensive immigration 
reform. 
Dr. Streeter. Subject our workforce development policies to the 
same creativity and reform-mindedness that we have with K–12 
and other forms of higher ed. 
Dr. Hendren. I would take a life course approach across all ages 
of children and think about where in places where a particular age 
of kids are falling behind, target programs at those ages. 
Representative Beatty. Let me just say thank you very much, 
and I yield back my one second. 
[Laughter.] 
Chairman  Lee.  A  very  good  use  of  time.  Representative 
Schweikert. 
Representative  Schweikert.  One  second  early,  one  second 
wasted. Okay, as you know there are dozens of questions here. But 
if I was to—if I came to you and said give me the one or two top 
priorities, if I cared a lot about velocity, the movement in particu-
larly upward mobility and stratas, as you know right now there is 
some very interesting noise in some of the data that has come in 
over the last 12 months, still too early to—but there seems to be, 
particularly in wage and employment stability, those things, some 
really  interesting  numbers  happening  in  our  lower  quartiles  of 
some real health—you know, we have a fairly robust economy. 
But if I was to look at that in the longer term, if I came to you 
and said, hey, over the next 20 years I want to maximize this up-
ward velocity, what would you do? 
Dr. Hendren. So I think the surprising thing is I would say 
focus on children. Even though you are looking at wages you see 
today, those were produced 20 years ago, at least. So I think going 
back into the schools and realizing that the kind of economic statis-
tics we read every day were formed a long time ago. 
Representative  Schweikert.  Okay.  So  when  you  say  ‘‘chil-
dren,’’ is it the way we train children in the household formation? 
What is that? 
Dr. Hendren. So that comes back to the factors we were dis-
cussing. So things like the quality of the schools. So I think invest-
ing in children. I do think some of the other factors we have been

discussing that are, frankly, more amorphous, like the strength of 
the family structure, measures of social capital. I do not have a 
good solution for how—what types of policies are best suited to ad-
dress those issues. But what I can tell you is that they look like 
they are important. 
Representative Schweikert. Doctor, what would you do for ve-
locity? 
Dr. Streeter. I agree with Dr. Hendren that the younger the age 
of the person when you make the investment the better that veloc-
ity will show itself out over time. 
I think that making it possible for people to move around, even 
just within regions, I think is important. I think portability of ben-
efits, but also more flexibility in the way we do workforce develop-
ment training, so that when people are living on the east side of 
town and the best school for what they want to do is on the west 
side of town, making it possible for them to actually go to school 
over  there  and  finish.  And  if  the  car  breaks  down,  to  have  re-
sources to fix the car. 
I think some of the very real—— 
Representative Schweikert. So a transportation barrier—— 
Dr. Streeter. Yeah, just greater geographic mobility even within 
regions I think is something that would help a lot of people, if we 
thought more creatively about that. 
Representative Schweikert. When you look at your commu-
nity, what creates success? What creates that mobility, that veloc-
ity? 
Mr. Quin˜onez. So a great question. Most of the people can’t 
even get on a plane to fly from the East Coast to the West Coast. 
And I think we have a lot of people, again, in this country that can-
not—that are barred from doing that, or even barred from having 
the notion of being, you know, that they belong in this country. So 
I think we need to address those big questions, you know, nonethe-
less. And of course financial inclusion, having more direct ways of 
having people being banked and being included in the credit sys-
tem is very important. 
Representative Schweikert. Dr. Sharkey. 
Dr. Sharkey. Well I would agree with my colleagues here. And 
I would say let’s make sure that inequality in the country as a 
whole does not translate into more and more unequal communities. 
So that every kid has equivalent opportunity. That is unrealistic, 
but close to equivalent opportunities, no matter where that child 
grows up. Okay? So if the schools are functioning well, if there are 
community centers, after-school programs, then that child has a 
better chance of rising up. And that happens when there is afford-
able housing in every neighborhood across a city and a metro area, 
and opportunities are more equally—— 
Representative Schweikert. So in the House when we look at 
some of the housing statistics, you know, the Phoenix area is hav-
ing  wonderful  growth  right  now,  but  it  is  also  putting  quite  a 
squeeze on affordable housing. So in that case it’s a local zoning 
issue. 
Can I ask, and I am going to sort of say something and then ask 
you if you have a suggestion for what I can read to absorb. I think 
there are some very creative ideas out there. As you have written

about, libraries, and those things, we are seeing some communities 
that are now setting up sort of a community page. I have a 31⁄2- 
year-old daughter, and my wife went on this community page and 
was getting the playpen and those things from a neighbor I never 
knew. 
It turns out, we are seeing—there are some writings out there 
using that type of social relationship through one of these. There 
are patterns. And being bankable. We had an situation in Arizona 
maybe 20-some years ago where someone cashing a check was pay-
ing a 20 percent fee. They were literally giving up one day of labor. 
So there was an experiment allowing a number of churches and 
others to actually have a functioning ACH certificate through the 
banking  department  and  so  the  Catholic  Church  over  here  was 
cashing checks, and it crashed the price. So there are creativities 
out there. 
On the transportation side, it turns out that some organizations, 
these ride-sharing platforms, will actually do a discounted. So wait-
ing for the bus in Phoenix when it is 110 out when you can hit the 
button on a phone and get that ride sharing. We are working on 
an experiment right now with our local homeless campus where 
they have lots of jobs, but transportation was our barrier. It turns 
out, once again, technology may be that solution. And, you know, 
the choice that’s now coming through  where we  are starting to 
have  to  rethink  education,  is  education  sitting  in  a  room  with 
bricks and a ceiling and this and that? Or is part of my education 
coming through a screen? Part of it a neighborhood working group, 
a neighborhood robotics club? 
I guess what I am throwing out, Mr. Chairman, is everything 
here is quite real but yet we seem to approach it from 20-year-old 
solutions instead of understanding we are living in a digital revolu-
tion around us. And with that, I yield back. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you. Representative Beyer. 
Representative Beyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Sen-
ator, thank you for doing this. I talk to my four children all the 
time about the need to build as much social capital as they can, 
loneliness, happiness, their progress in life. 
Dr. Sharkey, you talked about the positive level and decreased 
levels of ‘‘violence,’’ how violent crime has really come down a lot 
since 1990, but we are still in the dilemma that we have 4.4 per-
cent of the population and 22 percent of the world’s prisoners. Al-
though I just read that the incarceration rate is the lowest it has 
been in 20 years. 
You talk about increased investment in the re-entry programs, 
things like offender aid and restoration. But what are the other 
strategies we can use, recognizing that locking up mom, dad, sister, 
uncle, whatever, destroys the family. 
Dr. Sharkey. It’s a great question. Thank you for the question. 
So the decline in violence has brought enormous benefits that have 
been experienced by the most disadvantaged segments of the popu-
lation. But the methods that we have relied too heavily on for the 
last 50 years, which is intensive policing and mass incarceration, 
have generated these just staggering costs that you mentioned. 
So what’s next? What’s the next model? I think we have models 
in place. For instance, the incarceration rate has plummeted in

New York. There is no increase in violence. Okay? We know that 
this—we  can  reduce  the  incarcerated  population  without  con-
sequences on violent crime. 
I would argue for an investment in law enforcement that allows 
law enforcement to do their job differently, to build trust, to regain 
trust, and build relationships particularly with low-income commu-
nities of color. I would argue that local community organizations 
played a central role in contributing to the drop in violence. They 
expanded on a large scale in the 1990s and took back parks, and 
playgrounds, and city streets, and communities. This contributed. 
We have causal evidence. This contributed to the crime drop. 
If we invest in those organizations that run re-entry programs, 
that work to try to re-integrate people coming out of the prison sys-
tem into jobs, into homes, back into their family life, then the best 
evidence we have suggests that that is the right approach. That is 
the next model moving forward. 
Representative Beyer. Thank you very much. In Northern Vir-
ginia that I represent we have very strong community policing. 
And not accidentally, all four sheriffs tell me they have the lowest 
number of people in their jails in a couple of decades. 
Representative Beyer. Mr. Quin˜onez, I was fascinated by the 
increase in credit scores. I wonder if you could help me on that. But 
I am also a car dealer in real life, and it is amazing how many of 
the customers we see have terrible credit scores. And I would love 
to connect you later with some of the national NADA and others 
about providing—we sold 17 million new cars last year, 40 million 
used cars. That is an enormous impact. If you could do the kind 
of financial training that you do with your folks to help Americans. 
Mr. Quin˜onez. That’s right. Thank you for pointing that out. 
Credit reports nowadays, I see them as sort of like passports to the 
marketplace, to the financial marketplace, that without that pass-
port you are really denied everything. And so that is why we put 
so much emphasis on helping people become visible in the credit 
marketplace. 
And one of the ideas that we are pushing is the idea of having 
a credit system have more visibility of the totality of people’s finan-
cial lives. And so the idea of including rental payments, or the idea 
of including even telecom, or even paying their cellphones, to be in-
cluded in the credit reports is actually something that could actu-
ally make them become much more visible by really having a fuller 
description of what they are doing with their money. 
Recently Experian, the company Experian, has started a program 
called ‘‘Boost.’’ And I have a personal story to share here, because 
one of my—my nephew, I actually told him about this product, and 
he  went  online  and  he  signed  up  to  Boost,  and  then  within  a 
minute his FICO score went up by 29 points. Nothing happened, 
nothing changed with him, all he did was just say, yes, you look 
at  my  transactional  information  on  his  checking  account,  and 
through that the credit system was able to sort of recognize him 
better. Whereas before, they thought he was more risky, but now 
he is less risky, and it is all because the logarithms included more 
data about him that increased his credit score by 29 points. So 
there’s a lot of different things we could be doing to get him——

Representative Beyer.  Let  me  interrupt  you  because  I  only 
have three seconds left. I will sign up for Boost tonight, though, 
thank you. 
And, Dr. Hendren, I want to have two more graphs on your open-
ing chart, which is the poverty rate and also the rate of increase 
in income, just to really understand why the mobility isn’t hap-
pening. 
But the elephant in the room is income inequality. What would 
be the impact of doubling the earned income tax credit? 
Dr. Hendren. I guess it would depend on how you pay for it, but 
I think there is evidence to suggest that it would increase labor 
force participation. It would increase after-tax incomes for a lot of 
Americans. And so I think, you know, that would probably be the 
impact. 
But again, I think the key thing for creating intergenerational 
change is whether or not it has spillover effects on children. And 
there  I  think  there’s  some  interesting  work  suggesting  that  it 
might, but I think there’s a lot of interesting work that needs to 
be done. 
Representative Beyer. Okay, thank you. 
Chairman Lee. Representative Trone. 
Representative Trone. We are now seeing a new type of seg-
regation in some of the school districts, gerrymandered school bor-
ders that fence out students, which often means segregating stu-
dents along racial lines. 
The 2016 GAO report found the public schools are more seg-
regated today by race and class than every before since the 1960s. 
In many ways, a child’s zip code determines their economic pros-
pects. A few weeks ago we had Secretary of Education DeVos and 
we asked her—and she was very evasive—a question regarding ra-
cial segregation posing a threat to the educational opportunities of 
children of color. 
Mr. Sharkey, can you speak about the long-lasting consequences 
of segregation as they relate to social capital, and also the lack of 
social capital impeding upward mobility in communities of color? 
Dr. Sharkey. Yes, thank you for the question. So there is very 
strong evidence that—well, first off, we know that segregation gets 
worse for families with school-age kids. So segregation is not an ac-
cident, okay? It is intentional. We have set up policies that allow 
people to sort into different communities, and then to set up barri-
cades that make sure that their kids go to schools with resources 
and the other kids do not. This is opportunity hoarding. It is very 
explicit. It is very intentional. It has gone on for decades. 
We also know, with very strong evidence, that when kids get the 
opportunity to go to more economically diverse schools, they do bet-
ter. Okay? Heather Schwartz has done excellent research on this 
based on data from Montgomery County, which has a very strong 
inclusionary zoning program, where kids were randomly assigned 
to housing developments. Some were in more economically inte-
grated schools than others. 
The low-income kids who went to more integrated schools did 
better.  Those  improvements  in  academic  achievement  lasted  for 
several years following. Okay? So we know that segregation harms 
the academic achievement of low-income kids. We know that eco-

nomic segregation is particularly severe among families with chil-
dren, and we know that the consequences extend into later in life. 
Representative Trone. Mr. Quin˜onez, studies indicate 80 per-
cent of jobs are found through social capital through connections, 
relationships. What government actions have historically prevented 
communities of color from accessing social capital needed for that 
economic mobility? 
Mr. Quin˜onez. I mean I will speak on that from an immigrant 
perspective. And so one of the realities is that immigrant commu-
nities, because of the different types of legal statuses that we may 
have and we may live in mixed-status families, some may have 
legal documentation, others may not. And that is a huge impedi-
ment from really realizing the economic potential. 
So to some extent even like my own family, I mean we were able 
to help each other because we were family, we were helping each 
other, and so that was the essence of our social capital, through 
friends that we were in a similar situation. So the idea of linking— 
and I hope I am being clear about this—that when we think about 
economic mobility, we have to think about the broken immigration 
system because that in and of itself is really causing a lot of people 
from like not really reaching their economic potential. 
Representative Trone. Mr. Sharkey, given that persistence of 
neighborhood segregation and the inequality of social capital, what 
investments need to be made to ensure every community has the 
opportunity to succeed, and our children can succeed? 
Dr. Sharkey. Thank you for the question. So there are two sets 
of investments we can think about, and Dr. Streeter mentioned one 
of them. One, we can give people more chance to move to areas of 
opportunity. And the types of moves that typically lead people to 
opportunity  are  long-range  moves,  moves  that  bring  people  into 
new parts of the country that offer greater opportunities. Okay? 
Those types of moves have become less common over time. So that 
is one strategy. And there are a whole bunch of approaches—hous-
ing mobility approaches, but also just funding a mobility bank that 
lets people take risky moves, bringing them to different parts of the 
country. So that has to be one part of the strategy. 
And then the second part is making sure that in areas that have 
struggled,  in  areas  where  economic  opportunities  have  become 
more sparse, that we have investments in the core institutions, 
public schools, libraries, community organizations that prop up a 
neighborhood, that make sure that if economic conditions go down-
hill, that the community doesn’t fall apart, that kids have a place 
to go that the public schools don’t deteriorate, that churches don’t 
dry out and people stop coming. Okay? These types of investments, 
which are taken for granted in most communities across the coun-
try, have been absent particularly in low-income communities of 
color. 
So we need to make sure that every community across the coun-
try has these basic investments that provide the foundation for 
community life.

I want to—Dr. Sharkey, I want to pick up on some of those com-
ments, because the issue that I think is incredibly important for 
our country is to make sure, as you have all addressed, that eco-
nomic opportunity is everywhere in the country. We are not seeing 
that now. 
In fact, the numbers are pretty dramatic. I think, Dr. Sharkey, 
you mentioned in your testimony as well that if you look at just 
a few geographic areas, most all of the economic growth—I think 
a 2016 study from the Economic Innovation Group showed that 
New York City, Miami, Los Angles, Houston, and Dallas have as 
large an increase of business as the rest of the Nation combined, 
just those few urban areas are growing whereas the rest is being 
left behind. And we are finding in rural areas, in particular, as peo-
ple leave. 
You mentioned in terms of mobility one of it is to allow long- 
range moves, which is true. And I think it is hard for folks who 
are seeing it very difficult to move to those areas that are very ex-
pensive. There isn’t the social safety net for them, so they stay 
home. 
But if we are encouraging  people to move,  they will  move to 
these areas. And those areas continue to grow. And you have folks 
who have the ability to move, leaving other areas, you are actually 
accelerating the situation. 
And I get your point about investing in these other areas, but it 
seems as if we actually accelerate it. What’s your thought on that? 
Dr. Sharkey. Yeah, so you have to balance—again, thank you 
for the question—you have to balance these two goals. One is mak-
ing sure that every American has access to areas of high growth. 
So that partly involves encouraging moves, and even risky moves. 
It  also  involves  transportation  policy  that  brings  people  nearby 
those centers of growth that allows them to commute in quickly on 
high-speed rail and still live in affordable housing nearby. 
Senator Peters. That only makes those few areas just bigger. 
Dr. Sharkey. Well that’s—so that’s the second part of it. And 
this is the challenge that we haven’t grappled with as a Nation 
right now, is that there are large sections of the country that are 
left behind. Okay? And so the policies that have to be oriented to 
those sections of the country left behind are very different. 
This is not about purely focusing on economic growth; it is about 
making sure that those sections of the country left behind, those 
towns and cities, have functioning institutions that, as job opportu-
nities become less common, people have access to retraining; people 
have access to education; people have access to child care; people 
have access to financial institutions; kids have access to community 
centers and after-school programs. 
These are the types of investments that can get people back on 
their feet and that can make a community start to thrive again. 
But those investments have been absent. And there are several 
programs that it would be good to talk about because they are 
proofs of concept. 
One was carried out in Milwaukee in the 1990s. That was the 
New Hope Program. What was unique about this program is that 
it was targeted toward people in low-income communities, and it 
guaranteed community service jobs for anyone who was willing to

work 30-plus hours per week. It guaranteed them a job. It was 
available to people without families. It was available to single men, 
okay, unlike many similar programs. 
It did not just reduce poverty among the people who took part— 
and there was a randomized control trial to evaluate—it did not 
just reduce poverty and increase work hours, it also affected the 
children. So it also improved academic performance of people who 
took part. It reduced behavioral problems of people who took part. 
So this is a proof of concept, that if we provide these kinds of in-
vestments, (a) it gets people back into the workforce; but (b) it also 
supports families. It brings people back into the community. 
Senator Peters. There’s a minute left. Does anybody else want 
to take a stab at regional inequality? What do we need to do? 
Dr. Hendren. So I would be happy to add one piece of data to 
that discussion, and I think we often talk about promoting jobs, 
and I don’t want to downplay that by any stretch, but if you look 
across the United States at places that have the highest rates of 
upward mobility, they are not necessarily the places that have had 
the highest job growth over the last 30 years. 
A couple of notable examples are places like Atlanta and Char-
lotte, two localities that have had some of the highest job growth, 
the highest income growth of any metropolitan area in the United 
States, but they have some of the lowest rates of upward mobility. 
And intuitively what’s going on there is that the economy today 
that is there is in a sense importing the talent from other areas 
of the country. And I think this sort of highlights a distinction 
when we talk about the role of educational investment, social cap-
ital  investment,  and  we’re  talking  about  the  production  of  that 
human capital for the next generation that will be in the labor 
market in whatever city they choose to live as an adult. 
Senator Peters. Thank you. 
Chairman Lee. Okay, it is now nearly 11:30. We have just com-
pleted our first round. We are going to go ahead and start a second 
round of questioning. We have the room until noon. That is when 
we get kicked out. We will go as far into the second round as we 
can before we are evicted. 
Dr. Hendren, you have previously co-authored a paper in which 
you discuss racial inequalities in intergenerational mobility. And in 
that you cast some doubt on the viability of policies such as tem-
porary cash transfers or minimum wage hikes, at least as far as 
providing a viable, sustainable solution. 
Instead, as I understand it, you and your co-authors suggest that 
intra-neighborhood solutions such as mentorship for African-Amer-
ican boys, or efforts to facilitate interaction across racial groups, 
could provide for more effective solutions in the long run. 
How should we as policy makers, as Federal lawmakers, specifi-
cally, be thinking about increasing access to social capital, not just 
for this generation but for future generations as well, looking at it 
from a sustainability standpoint. 
Dr. Hendren. That’s a great question, so thanks for the oppor-
tunity to talk about that. So you’re absolutely right. What we found 
is that in every neighborhood in the United States upward mobility 
for low-income Black children is lower than the upward mobility 
for low-income White children. And so that suggests that in order

to address the race gap in economic outcomes that we see in adult-
hood, you actually have to go within the neighborhood. 
It  is  not  just  about  across  neighborhoods  directly.  So  I  think 
what to do on that front, we have some speculative solutions that 
you discussed, things like mentorship and things like promoting 
greater integration within neighborhoods and within schools. 
I think it comes back to some of the earlier discussion about zon-
ing, and to what extent people that might live fairly close together 
are actually growing up in the same community. I think, thinking 
about this as kind of a national issue, even though the decisions 
are being made locally, I think that is what is crucial here, that 
all of the local decisions that are going in in the local zoning board 
have national implications. And I think that makes, obviously, pol-
icymaking quite difficult. But I think it is the reality. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you. Dr. Streeter, you cite the enduring 
connection between civic engagement in America and religion in 
America. In the past we have seen some attempts by the Federal 
Government to try to incorporate faith organizations into the provi-
sion of various services. For example, when George W. Bush was 
President, he had an Office of Faith-Based and Community Initia-
tives. 
How else might public policy protect and perhaps even empower, 
or further the efforts of faith-based organizations in communities 
in their charity and their civic engagement work? 
Dr. Streeter. Great question, and I think the first answer to 
that is to invite them in. And then to ensure that the barriers to 
entry are as low as possible while protecting these important dis-
tinctions that we have in the First Amendment. 
I think the regulatory reform work that was done in the Bush 
Administration through that office was actually a good step in the 
right direction, kind of leveling the playing field, without requiring 
religious quotas or anything like that, but making it easier for or-
ganizations that are very missional, whether they are rooted in re-
ligion or not, to actually be involved as part of the solution. 
I  think  that—and  this  just  dovetails  off  of  some  comments  I 
made earlier in my prepared remarks—I think that sort of one 
practical thing we can do as policymakers is look at the way in 
which our devolutionary policymaking gives incentives to municipal 
leaders and others to invest in institutions very broadly, those that 
are best equipped to solve problems that they are invited into the 
solution equation, whether they are religious groups or not. 
I think that was one of the effects, whether it was superintended 
or not, I think it was partially intended by welfare reform. I think 
some of the community partnerships that we’ve seen in community 
policing where neighborhoods really have ownership over the safety 
of their parks and their streets. A lot of times when you get on the 
ground and you go to the communities where this is affected, you 
actually have houses of worship that are involved in those partner-
ships. 
And so I think creating incentives without requirements is the 
best thing to do. And fortunately we have some things in our own 
policymaking history that serves as a guide.

Chairman Lee. Are there things in our own policymaking his-
tory that also serve as a guide of what not to do? Is there anything 
in particular that may be harmful? 
Dr. Streeter. Yes, I think—well certainly erecting barriers that 
go beyond the case law with respect to religious organizations was 
a problem. This kind of crowding out effect that government pro-
grams had on religious organizations. I think a lot of that was cor-
rected during those reforms in the early 2000s that you cited. 
But I think providing an environment that is overly hostile to 
houses of worship disadvantages communities that need that help 
the most, here those institutions are super strong. We just have to 
acknowledge that. And when you look at the civic backbone of this 
country, you really can’t disentangle it from the religiosity of people 
that are involved. I mean a lot of our civic activity in this country 
is fueled and driven by people that are motivated through their 
faith and through organizations that are faith-based. 
And so we certainly don’t want to crowd out their good efforts. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you. 
Representative Heck. 
Representative Heck. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Dr. Hendren, let’s talk housing. Did you study the relationship 
at all between long-term homeownership and either upward mobil-
ity or the factors supporting strong social capital? 
Dr. Hendren. So homeownership in particular is not something 
that has popped out at us as one of the strongest correlates of up-
ward mobility. We have done a lot of work looking at the rule of 
housing policy, though, in shaping upward mobility for low-income 
kids, most notably the impact of the Moving To Opportunity Exper-
iment relating to some of the discussions we were having earlier 
about the negative impact of large-scale public housing investments 
that were disinvested in over the course of the years. 
Representative Heck. But that is not a homeownership pro-
gram. 
Dr. Hendren. No, it is not a homeownership program. 
Representative Heck. So you did not study homeownership? 
Dr. Hendren. So we have looked the—if I recall correctly, and 
I could get the statistic for you exactly—we have looked at the rela-
tionship between upward mobility and the fraction of people who 
own a home. And my recollection is that that was not as strong of 
a correlate as some of the other things we found. But I could pro-
vide that for you afterwards. 
Representative Heck. I would appreciate it very much. And let 
me lay out the facts and ask you to accept them as a given for at 
least now. 
Dr. Hendren. Sure. 
Representative Heck. The fact is that demand far exceeds sup-
ply right. An objective analysis suggests we are about 5 million 
homes short in this country. It is not uniformly concentrated. It’s 
here, and it is there. We are not building enough homes. Construc-
tion is not keeping up with demand. Wages are not keeping up 
with prices. 
And if you actually follow that through, here’s what happens. Be-
cause we are especially not building new starter homes now. The 
profit margins in starter homes is just not there as it once was in

this country. So people stay renting. People stay renting. Occupan-
cies go up. If occupancies go up, rents go up. This is all verifiable. 
If rents go up, more people become rent burdened. If more people 
become rent burdened, more people become subject to the need of 
publicly subsidized housing, and indeed more people become home-
less. 
The fact is, notwithstanding popular discussion, the single larg-
est increase in household budgets in the last 15 years is not the 
cost of a college education, and not the cost of health care; it’s the 
cost of shelter. Those of us who have been fortunate to be in our 
own home for longer than that don’t have eyes on that, don’t expe-
rience that, except insofar as, I’ll just use the random example, our 
27-year-old  son  is  still  living  upstairs.  Not  quite  sure  who  that 
would relate to. Oh, yes, it would relate to my household. 
So this is all despite the fact that homeownership, which is now 
being deferred, and which is now still commonly aspired to by the 
average American, we have a situation where we are nonetheless 
one of the lower percentages of homeownership in modern history. 
And we also know—these are all facts—that homeownership is 
the largest net worth building tool of the average American. So I 
cannot square that it is not a significant factor in upward mobility 
with that set of facts; that it is the largest increase in household 
budgets in the last 15 years; that homeownership is being deferred; 
and that it is the largest net worth building tool of the average 
American. 
Can you square your conclusion with that set of facts? 
Dr. Hendren. Yes. So what I would say is that when you look 
across the United States, what you are referring to is more of what 
I would argue is a factor that is affecting almost every family. And 
I think that is largely true. 
Now I don’t want to say for one second that the role of homeown-
ership has no place in thinking about upward mobility, but what 
we can say is that when you look across the metropolitan areas of 
the  United  States  that  is  not  one  of  the  strongest  factors  that 
jumped out to us in the data. 
Now that doesn’t mean that it is not playing a factor. This comes 
back to a lot of the discussion we were having at the beginning of 
the hearing about do we know exactly what the right policies are 
for promoting upward mobility? The answer is, no. And it very well 
could be homeownership. And I don’t think any of us want to say 
that that’s something that is or is not. 
Representative  Heck.  Well  thank  you  for  that.  And  to  say 
nothing of the fact that if you happened to be a person of color, the 
long-term pattern is you’ve been systematically shut out of buying 
in certain areas, and the manner in which credit is extended to 
low-income people of color is disproportionate and discriminatory 
over a long period of time and upward mobility, Dr. Hendren. 
Dr. Hendren. And today in places that were historically red-
lined, you see lower rates of upward mobility. 
Representative Heck. Thank you, sir. Yield back, Mr. Chair-

questions, that I kept hearing a theme about the next generation 
in children; if you want to change the trends, yes, you want to im-
prove things for folks today, right now, but if we really want to 
change the—I think you were saying velocity, a little bit of Whit-
ney  Houston,  which  I  loved—but  it  is  true  that  if  we  want  to 
change it, we have to look at where they’re at. The formative years. 
You know, I’m thinking about girls in STEM, and by third grade 
if you’re not encouraged in math and science you’re going to opt 
out. 
We have identified some of these more sensitive times. With that 
in mind, I think this is probably to Dr. Hendren. If better schools 
and neighborhoods, similar to the conversation I think you just 
had, improve upward mobility for children, it seems important that 
families have more choices about where they live and where to edu-
cate themselves. 
Families in the study that you referenced used the Federal Hous-
ing Voucher Program to make this move, but there are a lot of fam-
ilies that do not fit into that mold and cannot access that for many 
reasons,  so  they  are  outside  the  Federal  Housing  Program  and 
would like to duplicate this and move to different neighborhoods 
with greater opportunity, or greater flexibility to educate the kids 
how they want to. 
What are some ways that we can affect policy to benefit that and 
loosen those reins a bit? Or, nudge locals, you know, local munici-
palities and so on? We can’t tell them what to do, but we cer-
tainly—I’m thinking about CBDG funds, I’m thinking about Hous-
ing Funds, low-income tax credit, there’s a lot of things that we do 
have some rein on. 
Dr. Hendren. No, I think that is exactly right to think about. 
I think, you know, outside of the voucher program, thinking about 
the LYTEC program, where those investments are being made, and 
are they being made from the perspective of trying to improve up-
ward mobility for children? I don’t think that’s the common lens 
that’s used for guiding those investments today. And so how do we 
shape at a national level the incentives for those local decisions? 
And within the voucher program, I do think there’s an additional 
discussion about the ability to make opportunity moves to better 
neighborhoods for your children using a voucher. There’s a lot of 
discrimination that is faced by voucher holders, by people of color, 
by people of different backgrounds. And I think policy at a national 
level that can help break down some of those barriers for families 
is important. 
Representative Herrera Beutler. Alright, I yield back. Thank 
you. 
Chairman Lee. Representative Beyer. 
Representative  Beyer.  Senator,  thank  you  very  much.  My 
friend, Congressman Heck, left. I wanted to pile on on the housing 
issue because I noticed one of the recommendations, I think maybe 
it was Dr. Sharkey’s, about ending the mortgage interest deduction 
and reinvesting all of that. Obviously our realtor friends won’t be 
very happy with that. But the whole notion I think of having the 
mortgage  introduction  in  the  first  place  was  that  the  American 
Dream, that every American wants to own their own home, that 
this would stimulate homeownership.

And I had the advantage of living in Switzerland for four years 
where homeownership was 30 percent only, relatively low, but 80 
percent of the people lived in apartments. And with the increased 
urbanization of America, what we are seeing in so many places is 
increased urbanization and people moving into apartments, condos, 
things like that. 
By the way, the net worth of the average family in Switzerland 
is much higher than it is here, as is the life span and the happi-
ness. Can you dive, either, any of you, dive a little deeper into— 
yes, right now homeownership is an essential part of our net worth. 
Does it need to be? And is this now the time in an urbanized Amer-
ica to rethink homeownership and the stimulus that we put to it? 
Dr. Sharkey. Well let me start. Thank you for the question, 
Representative. So I think the question, the broader question that 
I think about is how do we invest in housing? And that is where 
my critique of the mortgage interest deduction comes in. This is a 
regressive policy. This is a policy that overwhelmingly benefits the 
highest income Americans and encourages people to buy the most 
expensive home they can. Okay? 
So when we think about how we want to invest our Federal re-
sources in housing, I would prefer a policy that does not encourage 
people to buy the most expensive home in the most exclusive neigh-
borhood they can, and then to do whatever possible to make sure 
that property values are stable, or that they increase by keeping 
other people out, by building fewer homes around them. 
And so that is the pattern of development that we have seen, 
that there are strong incentives for people to invest heavily so that 
their home is their main source of assets. And then they have the 
very  strong  incentives  to  reduce  development  around  them,  to 
make sure that affordable housing is not built because people are 
concerned about property values. 
So my broader approach is, if we are going to invest in housing, 
I think we should invest in affordable housing. I think we should 
try  to  give  the  opportunity  for  homeownership  or  for  affordable 
rental housing to a larger segment of the population. 
Representative  Beyer.  Mr.  Quin˜onez,  you  talked  about  the 
Mission Asset Fund. How participatory have the community banks, 
the credit unions, and the big banks been with you in terms of pro-
viding the capital necessary to grow that? 
Mr. Quin˜onez. Yeah, we’ve got a lot of backing from financial 
institutions to do our work, frankly. You know, Chase, Citibank, 
you know, Bank of America, all those institutions have supported 
our work, because ultimately they are the ones that actually are 
benefiting from this work. Which is, you know, we are expanding 
the pool of eligible borrowers so that they can go into those institu-
tions and get those loans to buy those homes, or get loans to buy 
cars, or invest in their businesses. 
And so I make sure to remind them of that, that they are there 
to—and it is a good thing, because we actually want our clients to 
engage with those mainstream financial institutions. But we also 
want them to support the actual work that goes behind it. 
But to your prior question about homeownership, I also would 
love to sort of—for us to sort of think about renters, to sort of say 
how can we elevate renters and how they manage, because right

now there’s a lot of benefit that we accrue to homeowners, and by 
way of the interest deductions and so forth, but by renters them-
selves have very little benefit. And so even making the rent pay-
ments don’t get recognized. 
So I mentioned, you know, the idea of including rental payments 
in credit reports could be one of those other ways of incentivizing 
or supporting that as a housing strategy. 
Representative Beyer. You had a couple of bullet points about 
Congress should clarify that U.S. citizenship is not a prerequisite 
for a bank account. Do banks think it is a prerequisite now? 
Mr. Quin˜onez. So right now, you know, we have heard from 
some  of  our  clients,  some  of  our  colleague  organizations  where 
some banks are actually asking for proof of their legal status, ei-
ther proof that they’re U.S. citizens, or proof that they are legal 
permanent residents. So even just to maintain their checking ac-
count. 
There are a lot of other financial products that require a Social 
Security number, and because of that requirement that actually 
leaves out a lot of legal permanent residents. Others may not have 
that. They may have an ITIN number, they have other things, but 
the idea that to create a financial product with a requirement of 
a Social Security number actually does leave out a lot of—millions 
of people in America from accessing those services. 
Representative Beyer. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, 
I yield back. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you. 
Mr. Schweikert. 
Representative Schweikert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will 
do this quick. 
Mr. Quin˜onez, there are actually data analytics out there that ac-
tually do create sort of an A–B alternative credit score, a lot of al-
ternative lenders already use that—— 
Mr. Quin˜onez. Yes. 
Representative Schweikert. Where some of the barriers, actu-
ally can Fannie, Freddie, others, also look at an A–B type credit 
score system. So the person that’s traditionally not been bankable, 
but has always been really good on their cellphone payment, this 
and that, and those actually have existed for years now. 
Mr. Quin˜onez. That’s right. 
Representative Schweikert. We took a run at that a few years 
ago in the Financial Services Committee, but were not able to get 
it through. 
There seems to be—and I know that it is a snapshot so it is hard 
for  you  all  to  do  your  analytics.  In  the  last  particularly  12–18 
months, you know, being someone—and the staff right behind me, 
she is incredibly smart. We have been trying to do digging into the 
U–6 data, some of the other things that we’ve seen, the employ-
ment data, and the populations that all of a sudden are gaining 
work, and some of the change in wages. 
Are you actually seeing right now this economic growth cycle, 
this employment cycle, is starting to create some real opportunities, 
or some movement with populations that, as economists or demog-
raphers, if it were just a couple of years ago we were saying this

population  is  probably  part  of  our  permanent  underclass?  You 
know, I obviously have an intense interest in economic mobility. 
Dr. Hendren, are we starting to see anything at least as a snap-
shot in this current cycle? 
Dr. Hendren. So I think the improvement in median wages re-
cently suggests that there are more children in these current years 
that are earning more than their parents than there were several 
years ago. I think that is likely true. And so I think that is obvi-
ously a good thing. 
As we think about coming back to the homeownership question, 
the role of these financial products, I think the idea of creating 
pathways for people to grow up—climb up the formal credit system 
is one way to continue to make that broad-based. 
Representative Schweikert. Well, and I know I am jumping 
on  my  own  question,  but  the  homeownership  housing  policy  is 
something  I  have  always  been  very  interested  in,  is  more  com-
plicated. If it is 2009–10, all of a sudden the fact we bought a 
house, it becomes crushing to mobility because you can’t sell it, or 
you are upside down on the mortgage. 
So we have to sort of understand that a vibrant housing market 
does also create the ability to I can sell and move, I can chase a 
job, and those things. 
So it turns out it is more complicated than just the fact it is a 
forced  bank  account.  Does  anyone  else  see  actually  some  inter-
esting things in the data runs of the last 12 months? 
Mr. Quin˜onez. I will share just one quick bit. What we have 
seen with our clients is that there has been some improvements on 
their incomes. But what was most interesting is how they managed 
to couple their wages with government programs, or how they man-
aged the money within their family to make ends meet. 
And so the idea that the more choice, or the people that have 
more strategies for managing income, those are the ones that are 
better off, rather than people that have just very limited or one 
strategy. 
Representative Schweikert. Mr. Chairman, he may have said 
the magic word, ‘‘creating options and choice,’’ instead of a sort of 
bureaucratic  command/control  may  be  the  solution  for  that 
optionality  that  everyone  should  have.  With  that,  I  yield  back. 
Thank you all. 
Chairman Lee. Thank you, Congressman Schweikert. I want to 
thank each of our witnesses. You’ve been terrific, the testimony 
you’ve prepared, both in writing your prepared statements today 
and your answers to our questions have been enormously helpful. 
And I thank you for coming. This hearing stands adjourned.

PREPAREDSTATEMENTOFHON. MIKELEE, CHAIRMAN, JOINTECONOMICCOMMITTEE 
Good morning, and welcome to this hearing of the Joint Economic Committee. 
To begin, I’d like to welcome back the members of this committee from the pre-
vious Congress, as well as our new members, and I’d like to congratulate Represent-
ative Maloney on her return as Vice Chair this Congress. I look forward to working 
with all of you. 
The  topic  of  this  hearing—expanding  opportunity—is  in  many  ways  a 
quintessentially American topic. As Abraham Lincoln put so eloquently, the leading 
object of our government has been to ‘‘elevate the condition of men—to lift artificial 
weights from all shoulders—to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all—to afford 
all, an unfettered start, and a fair chance in the race of life.’’ In other words, to 
remove barriers to opportunity. 
Often, however, policymakers have a limited understanding of what opportunity 
is. We sometimes see opportunity purely in terms of economic outcomes—namely, 
educational or financial success. And moreover, we can view financial capital as the 
only important source of wealth on which opportunity depends. 
Economic wealth is no doubt important, and it is right that the Federal Govern-
ment should seek to remove barriers to it. But to see opportunity exclusively in 
those terms fails to capture an invaluable source of wealth on which human beings 
draw, and one that is in fact key to expanding opportunity: social capital. 
Social capital is the wealth produced from our associational life—what we do to-
gether. It inheres in the web of social relationships through which we pursue joint 
endeavors, and it comes from our families, communities, workplaces, churches, ro-
tary clubs, and little leagues. And it is through these institutions of civil society that 
we make a happy and productive life with other people. They shape our characters 
and capacities, help us address the challenges we face in life, and provide us with 
meaning and purpose. 
For the past two years, the ‘‘Social Capital Project’’ of the Joint Economic Com-
mittee has documented trends in our associational life and its distribution across 
the country. It has studied the evolving nature, quality, and the importance of our 
associational life and the relationship it has to different problems our Nation is fac-
ing. 
The Joint Economic Committee has recently undertaken the work of exploring the 
connection between opportunity and social capital. And it is has found that oppor-
tunity is largely dependent on social capital, available to us through the relation-
ships we have with our families, friends, neighbors, fellow congregants, and cowork-
ers. These relationships are crucial for both our economic opportunities and our op-
portunity for producing and sustaining a vibrant, healthy, and meaningful commu-
nity life. 
And so the goal of the JEC is now to craft policies rooted in social capital—policies 
that will expand opportunity for all Americans by strengthening families, commu-
nities, and civil society. 
This undertaking will not be without its challenges. After all, social capital is not 
something we can see, touch, or directly measure. In addition to difficulties of meas-
urement, there are also difficulties in establishing its causal importance. And while 
policy can certainly help promote the bases for a flourishing civil society, we must 
also inevitably confront its limits, and determine when and to what extent the Fed-
eral Government has a part to play in this project and the extent to which it is in-
flicting harm. 
To bound the types of policies under consideration, and based on the past two 
years of its research, the Project has identified five broad goals related to oppor-
tunity: making it more affordable to raise a family, increasing how many children 
are raised by happily married parents, connecting more people to work, improving 
the effectiveness of investments in youth and young adults, and rebuilding civil soci-
ety. 
Our distinguished panelists will help us to shed light on these issues and ques-
tions today. I look forward to hearing their testimony, and to seeing the fruits of 
our discussion going forward. 
I now recognize Senator Hassan for opening remarks. 
PREPAREDSTATEMENTOFHON. MARGARETWOODHASSAN, AU.S. SENATORFROM 
NEWHAMPSHIRE 
Thank you, Chairman Lee, and thank you for holding a hearing in which we can 
examine innovative ways to increase economic opportunity in all of our commu-
nities.

I want to focus today on how we can create opportunity for entrepreneurs by in-
creasing their access to social connections and personal networks—or, in other 
words, by helping build their ‘‘social capital.’’ 
Entrepreneurs frequently use their personal connections to identify business op-
portunities, find community mentors, and secure the capital that they need to 
launch and grow their startups. 
However, not everyone starts off with connections to the business community, and 
entrepreneurs outside these informal networks can find it harder to access vital re-
sources like financial counseling and capital investment. 
This presents particular challenges for women entrepreneurs. 
Last year, the National Women’s Business Council issued a report that found that 
women’s personal networks have fewer connections with ties to resources like finan-
cial capital. 
This is also an acutely important issue for entrepreneurs in rural areas of my 
State. 
In rural areas, there is often extremely limited access to high quality, affordable 
broadband internet, which is an absolute necessity for any business hoping to com-
pete in the modern economy. 
Limited broadband access slows entrepreneurship and contributes to the so-called 
‘‘brain drain’’—a problem for rural areas that I know, Mr. Chairman, you focused 
on in a report on social capital released just last week by this Committee. 
Fortunately, there are successful initiatives that Congress can build on. 
In New Hampshire, we have many non-profit organizations and business incuba-
tors that are leveraging community interest and Federal investments to build social 
capital for entrepreneurs from all walks of life. 
New Hampshire’s Small Business Development Center provides business adver-
tising and mentorship, for example. 
Our Regional Development Corporations provide business gap financing, and we 
have startup accelerators that tailor their services in innovative ways. 
So there are many programs already underway in the Granite State that can 
serve as models for our efforts to expand opportunity for entrepreneurs, and I expect 
there are models in lots of other states as well. 
In my view, having the opportunity to start and grow a business shouldn’t be all 
about ‘‘who you know.’’ 
Equality of opportunity for entrepreneurs should be predicated on a willingness 
to work hard to transform an innovative idea into a reality. 
The bottom line is that we must do more to level the playing field and help aspir-
ing business owners build social capital. 
Our country was founded on the idea that nurturing the talent and the energy 
of every person promotes human dignity and ignites a vibrant and competitive econ-
omy, and government certainly has a role in ensuring that we do just that. 
When we bring people in from the margins, our communities, our democracy, and 
our economy all benefit; we thrive and we build a strong future for our children. 
So, I look forward to our witnesses’ testimony today on how we can help all Amer-
icans build social capital. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1. As I noted during the hearing, social connections are often critical for 
entrepreneurs  seeking  the  counseling,  investment,  and  other  resources 
necessary to start and grow a small business. 
Given the unique challenges faced by entrepreneurs with limited social 
capital—such as women entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs in rural areas 
lacking quality broadband internet—what are some specific steps that you 
would recommend Congress take in order to encourage the development of 
social capital and promote economic opportunity in disadvantaged commu-
nities? 
Thank you for the opportunity to discuss this question. On the one hand, you can 
work to promote entrepreneurship of adults interested in pursuing such a career. 
However, our work would suggest one should also focus attention on cultivating the 
entrepreneurial opportunities and skills in the next generation. At this point, we 
don’t know the best policies to do this, but we do know that the development of 
ideas, starting of a business, and creation of economic opportunity is rooted in child-
hood  environments.  I  would  consider  the  encouragement  of  more  programs  in 
schools to help promote entrepreneurship. I would also consider after-school pro-
grams to promote a greater understanding of how to start a business. I would also 
support programs that facilitate greater summer youth employment programs, per-
haps helping youth work in small businesses, which would allow them to be exposed 
to the type of internship opportunities children from more affluent backgrounds use 
to develop social capital during childhood and succeed later in life. To be sure, these 
policy suggestions are speculative at best, and so I would also encourage imple-
menting policies in this area that are rigorously tested (e.g., through randomized 
control trials). But nonetheless, I do believe a greater focus on growing the opportu-
nities available for the next generation holds the most promise for addressing this 
important issue.

would recommend Congress take in order to encourage the development of 
social capital and promote economic opportunity in disadvantaged commu-
nities? 
Because it is difficult to jump-start economic activity in disadvantaged commu-
nities through traditional tactics such as luring a company with tax credits, it seems 
regional strategies are more promising. Finding ways to connect disadvantaged com-
munities with growing areas within a distinct geographic region is more likely to 
help the former, rather than focusing on individual communities by themselves. 
This is typically how outlying areas around a central hub of economic activity, such 
as small towns outside a growing urban area, continue to remain economically via-
ble themselves. Factoring this reality into our policymaking would be useful. 
One example where this kind of thinking has been implemented as policy is in 
the Regional Cities Initiative in Indiana (https://iedc.in.gov/programs/regional-cit-
ies-initiative/home). By way of full disclosure, I was involved in the conception and 
design of the initiative under then-Governor Mike Pence. The reason we pursued 
the Regional Cities strategy was for the foregoing reasons above—namely, the un-
comfortable but sober acknowledgement that some towns and counties simply would 
not bounce back on their own. The initiative provides matching funds to regional 
plans that connect disinvested areas with the regional city around which most of 
the economic activity in that part of the State occurs. This kind of structure gets 
people at the community level within a region thinking more broadly and strategi-
cally about what they have to offer the region, and forming relationships to that 
end. 
These kinds of regional partnerships could flourish more broadly if incentives 
within our HUD-based and workforce (DOL) funds, for starters, pushed community 
leaders at the State level in this direction.

• How would you address the problem of bank closings and the lack of 
banking services in low-income communities? How could financial in-
stitutions, nonprofits and governments work together to give residents 
access to those services? 
Banks are closing branches at record rates. Between 2009 and 2018, banks closed 
111,251 branches all across the country, a drop of 11.4%, leaving low-income fami-
lies in urban and rural communities in what is now known as ‘‘bank deserts.’’1 
While analysts attribute industry-wide market forces, consumer preferences, and 
technology as drivers of this trend, the loss of bank branches has been attributed 
to worse financial outcomes in the surrounding neighborhoods.2 
There is an opportunity to reinvent bank branches into ‘‘Financial Community 
Centers’’ that can prevent the proliferation of bank deserts and preserve access to 
essential financial services. 
The idea is simple: In neighborhoods with a dearth of financial services or where 
branch shutdowns are imminent, banks could partner with community-based orga-
nizations who are already present in the area to repurpose their branches into Fi-
nancial Community Centers. Depending on the particular needs and limitations of 
each branch, Financial Community Centers could provide much-needed services 
like: 
• Smart ATMs to allow consumers to access their accounts. In most cases, banks 
could simply leave their ATMs operational and agree to service them as they 
do with smaller branches in grocery stores. 
• In-person bank tellers. Tellers employed by the bank could be present to assist 
consumers in person, or the bank could enable nonprofit staff members to help 
consumers open new accounts, apply for credit, and access money orders and 
other services from their existing accounts. 
• Ongoing financial education and coaching services to consumers, including guid-
ance about how best to leverage the financial and banking products they al-
ready have. 
• International money transfer products, allowing clients to send remittances to 
family abroad. 
• Business incubators programs, homeownership programs, and referrals to other 
critical services pertinent to that specific community. Banks could even fund 
some of this programming using dollars from the Community Reinvestment Act. 
Partnerships like these leverage the unique strengths of nonprofits and financial 
institutions—giving community organizations the tools to better serve the clients 
with whom they already have built relationships and trust, and allowing banks to 
more profitably deliver high-quality products to a larger customer base. 
Such partnerships are not out of the ordinary. In fact, some banks and commu-
nities have already struck partnerships, presenting viable models for what more 
that could be done with the right guidance and direction from Congress.

entrepreneurs  seeking  the  counseling,  investment,  and  other  resources 
necessary to start and grow a small business.

would recommend Congress take in order to encourage the development of 
social capital and promote economic opportunity in disadvantaged commu-

Traditional employment alone, it turns out, does not lead to financial security for 
the working poor. Infrequent hours and low, stagnant wages have made entrepre-
neurship an appealing alternative despite higher risks. Many entrepreneurs are

choosing to monetize their skills in solopreneurship, contract or gig work, side jobs, 
and other forms of self-employment. These ‘‘nano-ventures’’—small, local, and often 
informal entrepreneurial endeavors—are an important, increasingly popular source 
of employment in the U.S.1 
Nano-ventures face many of the same challenges as small business, including 
working with tight budgets, accessing capital, marketing and building connections, 
and managing high levels of risk and uncertainty in their personal and professional 
lives. 
Many of these entrepreneurs struggle to navigate hurdles since existing services 
and policies are not designed for them. Much of the social services infrastructure 
is designed to provide safety nets for those who are traditionally employed, and 
business counseling and capital is geared towards larger-scale enterprises, leaving 
nano-ventures without the support they need to succeed. For example, groups like 
the Small Business Administration (SBA) provide small businesses (formally incor-
porated businesses with up to 500 employees and under $7.5 million annual re-
ceipts2) with high levels of support, including low-interest loans averaging over 
$100,000; however, the corresponding high bar to entry, including needing to submit 
detailed business plans and financial projections, makes them inaccessible to nano- 
ventures. 
There is an opportunity to expand programs that are already helping small busi-
nesses,3 to be inclusive of, and accessible to nano-ventures. This could include ex-
panding the eligibility criteria to include those who are self-employed and just start-
ing up, or offering smaller supports with easier application processes. These services 
could be delivered through local ‘‘Financial Community Centers,’’4open to nano-ven-
tures, micro businesses, and small businesses alike. These centers could create op-
portunities for human interaction where professional relationships can form, and be 
the focal point for Congress to support entrepreneurs in many ways: 
• Dedicate space for members to network with each other, share resources, collec-
tively address challenges particular to their industry or locality, and even use 
their numbers to purchase group insurance plans at lower rates.5 
• Offer counseling and educational services to nano-ventures—for instance, in 
choosing the appropriate designation (contractor, LLC, corporation, etc.), sepa-
rating personal and business finances, developing business plans and financial 
documents, and filing taxes 
• Provide ‘‘nano-loans’’—affordable, small-dollar capital with fewer application re-
quirements and less stringent underwriting than the typical small business 
loan—to support the development of nano-ventures and close the gap in credit 
availability between the median $5,000 personal credit card limit and the min-
imum $50,000 SBA-backed small business loan. 
• Extend tax incentives, such as the Qualified Business Income deduction and 
write-offs for allowable business expenses, to nano-ventures; eliminate disincen-
tives like higher social security taxes on entrepreneurial income; and extend 
VITA tax preparation assistance to nano-ventures 
• Offer alternatives to traditional work-based safety nets6 like portable and en-
trepreneur-owned benefits, government-sponsored retirement accounts, and tax 
write-offs for healthcare and other insurance payments 
• Amend means testing for public benefits to make it easier for nano-ventures to 
report their true personal income. Like small businesses, nano-ventures should 
be able to exclude business income and assets so that those who are self-em-
ployed don’t have to worry about business ventures affecting their families’ eli-
gibility for social safety net programs.

6An important part of supporting entrepreneurship is thinking about how entrepreneurs, es-

available through the workplace. See, for example: <https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-ave-

Congress could also invest in research to better understand the role that nano-

strengths and needs of these entrepreneurs. With the right action, we can support

Upward Mobility in the United States 
Nathaniel Hendren 
 
I grew up inspired by the notion of The American Dream; I believe that every child should have 
the opportunity to climb the income ladder. In my research with a broad set of collaborators, we try 
to measure the extent to which we live up to this ideal. Unfortunately, our research shows that this 
dream is out of reach for too many children.  
 
There are many ways of quantifying the American Dream, but one way is to measure the fraction 
of children who grow up to earn more than their parents. We find that that for children born in 
1940, the American Dream was nearly a guarantee:  90% of children grew up to earn more than 
their parents. But today, only half of children grow up to earn more than their parents.

Another measure of The American Dream is the likelihood that a child born in the bottom of the 
income distribution reaches the top of the income distribution in adulthood – the ability to go from 
“rags to riches”. If incomes in adulthood were independent of one’s background, we would expect 
20% of those with low-income parents to grow up to reach the top fifth of the income distribution. 
But, in the US, only 7.5% of children whose parents are in the bottom fifth of the income 
distribution grow up to reach the top fifth of the income distribution as adults.  
 
Perhaps perfect mobility is too high of a standard. Another benchmark is to compare across 
countries. Here again, the US lags behind. In Sweden, 16% of children from the bottom 20% of the 
income distribution reach the top 20% of the distribution in adulthood. In Canada 14% rise to the 
top; 13% in Denmark; and 9% in the U.K.. The US as a whole has lower rates of social mobility 
than nearly every developed country for which we can measure it.   
 
Figure 2: Chance that a Child Born to Parents in the Bottom Fifth of the Income Distribution 
Reaches the Top Fifth, by Country 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This broad pattern masks the fact that there are places across the United States where the American 
Dream is alive and well. Rates of upward mobility vary dramatically across the country, and even 
within cities. In some neighborhoods in Provo, Utah, children from low-income families grow up 
to earn $66,000 on average at age 35. Contrastingly, low income children who grow up in parts of 
inner Baltimore grow up to earn, on average, only $16,000 in adulthood. 
 
Upward mobility varies even more when we compare across neighborhoods within cities. As we’ve 
documented in the Opportunity Atlas, children who grow up a few miles apart in families with 
comparable incomes have very different life outcomes. Children who grow up in low income 
families in other areas in Provo earn $30,000 in adulthood on average, less than half of the income 
of their neighbors. Or, to take another example in Midtown, Manhattan, where poor children 
growing up in neighboring tracts grow up to earn $28,000 and $45,000, depending on which side 
of 3rd Avenue they grew up on.

Figure 3: Adult Incomes for Low-Income Children, by Childhood Tract 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These striking disparities naturally raise the question: Why do outcomes differ so dramatically 
across places? Our results suggest that the economic outcomes we see today have their roots in the 
neighborhood environments in which we grew up. Every year a child spends growing up in a 
neighborhood with higher rates of upward mobility leads to higher incomes in adulthood.

The message is simple: neighborhoods matter. Where we grew up shapes our future outcomes. If 
we can improve these neighborhood environments for children, especially those who are most 
disadvantaged among us, we can increase upward mobility in the United States. The variation in 
the Atlas provides a learning opportunity that can inform such efforts; we can attempt to replicate 
the successes of high-mobility neighborhoods elsewhere. Across the US, we tend to see higher rates 
of upward mobility for children who grow up in places with lower poverty rates, better school 
quality, stronger family structures, and greater social capital.  
 
Figure 5: Characteristics of High-Mobility Neighborhoods 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I do want to be clear, however: While we can identify the characteristics of neighborhoods that tend 
to promote high rates of upward mobility, current data limitations prevent us from identifying the 
best policies for improving upward mobility. I am excited about our ongoing endeavors and 
collaborations  with  researchers  at  the  Census  Bureau  and  Treasury  department  to  further 
understand these potential pathways to promoting upward mobility. Uncovering the “recipe for 
success” will not be easy, but thanks to the access to administrative data and support of government 
research, I believe we can make progress on this important question.  
 
More generally, I am delighted to be here today to discuss how we might learn from evidence to 
inform policies that might improve upward mobility. While I know there is often considerable 
disagreement in politics, it is my hope that an evidence-based approach to improving economic 
opportunity for our children is a purpose that spans party lines and allows us to begin to restore the 
American Dream.

Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Maloney, Distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for asking me 
to testify on the relationship between social capital and opportunity in American public life.  
 
Through several decades of research, we know that social capital positively affects a wide range of 
things we all desire, such as good work, happy family lives, a good education, safety for our kids, and 
opportunity for us and others. Yet we do not utilize what we have learned about social capital very 
effectively in domestic policymaking anymore. I say “anymore” because there was a time when we were 
better at making communities and social capital central to our policy deliberations.  
   
I will explain what I am referring to in what follows, but first, it is worth highlighting a few important 
points about social capital from a new survey that my colleagues and I at the American Enterprise 
Institute have conducted.  
 
Consistent with other research, we found that people who know their neighbors, cooperate with them 
to solve community problems, and are involved in non-profit and other community organizations are 
less lonely, happier with the communities in which they live, and happier with their own lives.  
 
The benefits of social capital are especially interesting when we look at how the informal elements of 
social capital – such talking with and getting together with friends and neighbors – and formal elements 
– such as volunteering in civic groups – relate to each other. Americans who are both highly civic and 
highly social typically rate highest on almost any measure we construct or issue we examine.  
 
For instance, 46 percent of people who are both highly civic and highly social rate the communities 
where they live as excellent, compared to 36 percent of people who are highly social but not civically 
engaged. Only 24 percent of people who are neither social nor civic say the same. Additionally, people 
who are both highly civic and highly social are the least likely to say they would move away from their 
community if they could. This group is also much more likely to talk with their neighbors on regular basis 
than people who rate high on the social scale but low on the civic scale.  
 
A strong sense of community at the local level is most prevalent among people who are engaged in their 
communities, not just people who are neighborly. One-third of people who are both civic and social 
derive a strong sense of community from their neighborhood, compared to 19 percent of highly civic 
people who are unsocial, and 24 percent of highly social people who are not civic. Perhaps 
unsurprisingly, civic people of all stripes, including those who are not social, are more likely to say they 
believe they can have a positive impact in their community than others, including highly social people 
who are not civic.  
 
When it comes to happiness, 19 percent of highly social but civically unengaged people say they are 
“very happy,” compared to 28 percent of highly social and civic people. Highly civic but unsocial people 
register at 17 percent. The combination of civic engagement and sociability produces a significant 
happiness effect. Conversely, civic involvement correlates with lower levels of loneliness, which is a 
topic of shared concern these days. Unsocial people with high levels of civic involvement are more likely 
to report “never” feeling lonely than highly social people who are not civically involved. That is, 
community engagement correlates with less loneliness more than talking frequently with friends. 
 
Highly civic and social people are considerably more optimistic about their personal financial situation in 
a year relative to the economy as whole compared to other groups. There is not much difference in how 
people of all stripes expect the economy to be doing a year from now (slightly more than a quarter 
2 
 
expect improvement while slightly less than half think it will be about the same), and a greater share of 
all of them expect to be doing better personally than they expect the nation as a whole to be doing – 
but not even close to the degree of highly civic and social people.  
 
When it comes to issues of poverty and government’s role in addressing it, Americans are pretty unified, 
regardless of their civic and social standing. Slightly more than half say that poverty is due to 
circumstances beyond people’s control (as opposed to people not doing enough to better their 
situation) and that the fact that some people get rich while others are poor is a problem that needs 
addressing.  
 
Civic-minded people, however, show slightly more tolerance for the rich-poor gap in America as an 
acceptable part of our economic system, and highly civic and social people are the most likely to rate as 
“extremely important” the government’s responsibility to “increase the equality of opportunity for 
people to get ahead if they want to.” It seems that civic-minded people have a greater optimism that 
efforts of self-betterment together with appropriate government assistance will pay off. 
 
We cannot close out a discussion about civic and social groups without looking at the important role of 
religion. On average, 29 percent of highly civic people say religion is central to their lives, compared with 
15 percent of civically unengaged people. In every civic group (i.e., those with low, moderate, and high 
social scores) a greater share of people say religion is central to their lives than say “not important.” 
Exactly the opposite is the case for people who are not civically engaged, in which case about twice the 
share of respondents say religion is unimportant than rather than central to their lives. America’s 
tradition of civic engagement continues to have strong religious underpinnings.  
 
Having more people engaged in solving national problems in their own backyard is good for a number of 
reasons beyond the immediate problem being solved. Civic-minded Americans have more of almost 
everything we need more of in our country, so producing more of them and basing our policy decisions 
on this goal is critical. 
 
It seems that when civically minded community leaders in and out of government are asked to solve 
problems, they accept the challenge – which brings me back to the topic with which I opened my 
remarks.   
 
To think about the future of social capital in public policy, it is worth taking a look at the past. Oddly, we 
know so much more about the benefits of social capital today than we did in the mid-1990s, and yet we 
use incorporate it less when designing policy solutions. When Harvard’s Robert Putnam was kicking off a 
large research project on the topic that spawned a social capital research cottage industry in the late 
1990s, it came on the heels of a wave of policy reforms rooted in an understanding of the importance of 
local communities and networks.  
 
For example, from 1991 to 1996, we saw four major domestic policy reforms at the federal and state 
levels that all presupposed the indispensable value of basic units of civil society – family, neighborhood, 
community – in their policy design. Each was in its own way a reaction against shortcomings of Great-
Society-legacy programs that had concentrated too much authority for problem-solving in bureaucracies 
far from the communities they were – however well-intentioned – trying to serve.  
 
The first reform was in school policy, which began at the state and local level, and rippled across the 
country. The first school voucher program began in Milwaukee in 1990, and the first public charter 
3 
 
school law was passed in Minnesota in 1991. The premise of the school reform movement was to 
empower parents and families to either form their schools in cooperation with community leaders, or 
have the ultimate choice in where their kids went to school. The movement to expand charters and 
vouchers over the past 30 years reflects a Tocquevillian understanding of American civic life in which 
families, local officials, nonprofit organizations, and local foundations work together to achieve a public 
benefit.  The research on the effects is mixed, but it does seem clear that the competitive pressures new 
entrants place on incumbent schools generally tends to produce improvement, and a diversity of 
options, in local school districts.  
 
The second reform concerns public housing, which in city after city had become a symbol of a failed 
model, riddled with crime, drugs, and persistent poverty. HOPE VI, created by Congress in 1992, made 
the neighborhood rather than simple units of housing, the central focus of public housing assistance. 
Housing projects were torn down and replaced with mixed-income, sometimes mixed-use, 
developments that gave families in public housing a greater stake in their neighborhood. Over time, the 
program has produced about as many units of subsidized housing as were demolished. I should also 
mention that the Moving to Opportunity demonstration program, from which we have learned so much 
in the research of Nathaniel Hendren, Raj Chetty, and their colleagues, was created concurrently in 1992 
to test whether helping low-income families move to different neighborhoods would generate better 
outcomes.  
The third reform is community policing, which has a history predating the 1990s. But it was a 1994 
federal law aimed at helping cities implement community policing that effectively made it a nationwide 
practice. In the ten years after the law passed, the share of municipal police departments practicing 
community policing grew from about 20 percent to 68 percent. Today, more than 80 percent of police 
departments practice community policing. Instead of the top-down, crime-response practices of a 
previous era, community policing focuses on forming partnerships with neighborhoods and communities 
with a focus on preventing crime, rather than just responding to it.  
 
Fourth, and perhaps best-known, is welfare reform, which was created in 1996 amidst quite a bit of 
public debate. Most of the debate then, as now, was focused on the merits of work requirements and 
time limits on welfare recipients. Less-debated, but just as important in my view, was the fact that states 
and municipalities had to take responsibility for ensuring that welfare recipients successfully moved into 
the labor market. States that practiced second-order devolution – that is, devolved the responsibility for 
employment outcomes to counties and municipalities – typically saw better labor market outcomes 
among former welfare recipients. Reliance on local networks through chambers of commerce, 
vocational schools’ employer partnerships, and so on, was a way of situating social capital at the heart 
of the policy objective to move people from welfare into work.  
 
The idea that communities and the relationships that exist within them should be central to 
policymaking was “in the air” in the 1990s. Even the party platforms in 1996 reflected this reality. I have 
documented this phenomenon in a recent National Affairs essay and will not recount it here, but suffice 
it to say that both parties in 1996 saw families, neighborhoods, and communities as important elements 
in combatting domestic policy problems; and in 2016, that language is almost entirely absent.  
 
If we hope to continue to make progress in serving individuals and families who are on the outside of 
American prosperity staring in, we should pull a few pages from the 1990s playbook and make 
community relationships central again. It is well and good to have debates about policies such as 
expanded wage subsidies and retooled safety net programs that help people make progress in the labor 
4 
 
market. But if we fail to recognize the important role that networks play at the local and regional levels 
in people’s upward mobility prospects, our national debates about these former types of policy will 
achieve limited impact. Our workforce development systems at the state and local levels, for starters, 
could benefit greatly from a renewed focus on how networks and relationships at the community level 
could help low-income aspiring workers fare far better in the labor market than they currently are.  
 
Thank you.

My name is José Quiñonez. 
 
I am an immigrant, came to this country in the dark of night as a nine-year old, adjusted 
my status through the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, became a U.S. 
citizen, and now I’m living my American Dream of helping low-income people become 
visible, active and successful in the financial marketplace.  
 
As CEO of the Mission Asset Fund, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, 
California, I have first-hand experience addressing the daunting financial challenges our 
clients face every day.  
 
And what I’ve learned is this: being poor in America is expensive, particularly for people 
living outside of the financial mainstream.  
 
Nationally, one-in-seven Latinos are unbanked, meaning they do not have checking or 
savings accounts. While researchers point to various reasons why people go without 
accounts, we know banks exclude people based on immigration status or by requiring 
narrow forms of IDs. Consequently, many of our clients are left unbanked and without a 
choice but to rely on alternative providers that charge more to cash checks or pay bills. 
The average underserved household that earns $25,500 annually pays about 10% of 
their income on fees and interest for financial services that those of us with bank 
accounts often get for free. 
 
Lacking access to credit is a challenge. Nationally, nearly one-in-three Latinos are credit 
invisible, meaning they do not have credit scores or credit reports. Given the nature of 
our economy, there is little anyone can do without credit—people cannot get loans to 
buy homes or start businesses, they cannot rent apartments, and, in some states, they 
cannot even get jobs without employers checking their credit reports. Without access to 
affordable credit, people turn to high cost lenders—some paying 100% APRs on small-
dollar loans, and significantly more for short-term payday loans.  
 
Barriers to economic mobility are not just financial. People are also burdened with 
uncertainty from the current anti-immigrant political environment, fearing losing their 
families and draining their savings. Many worry of being detained for lack of 
documentation—igniting a financial crisis. Bail alone could strip them of $5,000; 
obtaining legal representation, up to $20,000; and the costs mount from there. 
 
So, how can we help people realize their economic potential when they are financially 
invisible and facing enormous challenges in their lives?  
 
We found answers in how our clients leverage social capital—their relationships with 
family and friends to survive and thrive.  
 
Our clients practice a time-honored tradition of lending and saving money together; it’s 
an activity known by hundreds of different names throughout the world but which is 
essentially the same. A group of people come together and agree to pool their money 
so that one member of the group can take the lump sum, and they do it again on a 
weekly or monthly basis until everyone in the group has had the chance of getting the 
lump sum. When people don’t have access to loans, this is how they create their own, 
using only their word and trust.  
  
We built our Lending Circles Program on this tradition. We formalized loans by having 
participants sign promissory notes, which MAF then services and reports to credit 
bureaus. 
 
Since launching the program in 2008, we have made 11,223 loans to help participants 
build credit—in fact, they see an average score increase of 168 points, opening a world 
of possibilities for them in the credit market. And the repayment rate is 99.3 percent—an 
unheard-of rate in the microlending world.  
 
Lending Circles is an example of what we could do with—and for—people if we design 
programs and policies for success, based on people’s strengths and social capital to 
create real lasting change.  
 
Despite the promise from this approach, it is not enough to help the millions of people 
trapped by barriers that diminish their economic potential.  
  2 
We need better data to understand people’s challenges. Research reports based on 
national datasets often ignore those who are financially invisible, thereby missing critical 
segments of our society. 
 
Congress can remove asset limits to public benefit programs like SNAP that are a 
lifeline for families not earning enough to make ends meet.  
  
Congress can provide clarity that US citizenship is not a prerequisite for accessing 
financial services, and allow for more government-issued IDs when opening accounts. 
  
Congress can significantly reduce the number of credit invisible by allowing positive 
payment data from utilities, rent, and telecoms to be included in credit reports. 
 
And Congress can require “ability to repay” underwriting standards and longer 
repayment terms for small-dollar and payday loans. 
  
I believe these reforms can go a long way to unlock people’s economic potential, and 
help them realize their American Dreams too.   
  
Thank you for holding this hearing and I look forward to continuing this important 
conversation.

A Hearing of the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress 
 
“Expanding Opportunity by Strengthening Families, Communities, and Civil Society” 
 
April 30th, 2019 
 
Statement of Patrick Sharkey, Ph.D. 
Department of Sociology and Robert F. Wagner School for Public Service, New York 
University 
 
“Building Stronger Communities” 
 
Thank you Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Maloney and members of the Committee for the 
chance to address you today. I’ll focus my comments on a basic question: How do we 
create stronger communities? My answer to that question is based not on my own 
opinions on how I think the world works or how it should work; it’s based on my 
reading of the best evidence that has been generated over the past few decades of social 
science.  
 
First let me provide a sense of the problem. Thirty years of evidence from policy 
experiments, from careful quantitative studies comparing children raised in different 
residential settings, and from rich qualitative studies following families over long 
periods of time, leads to a similar conclusion: the neighborhoods in which children are 
raised play a central role in influencing their academic achievement, cognitive 
development, physical and mental wellbeing, and economic mobility.i Labor market 
opportunities, social networks, environmental hazards, and the quality of institutions 
like schools, libraries, banks and police departments vary dramatically depending on 
where one lives, creating a rigid geography of vulnerability and opportunity.  
 
Even as this evidence has become stronger over time, there is good reason to think that 
it understates the full impact of neighborhood inequality. The vast majority of children 
who currently reside in poor neighborhoods are from families that have lived in 
similarly poor neighborhoods for multiple generations, and the consequences of living 
in highly disadvantaged neighborhoods are cumulative.ii This is particularly true for 
African Americans. Roughly three out of four African American children currently 
living in the nation’s poorest, segregated neighborhoods are from families that have 
lived in similarly poor neighborhoods for at least two generations.iii Growing up in a 
poor neighborhood with low-quality schools, high levels of violence, and few economic 
opportunities affects your early experiences in the labor market, your mental health, 
your wealth, and all of this affects the life chances of the next generation. The impact of 
neighborhood disadvantage on outcomes like cognitive skills and economic success is 
greatest for those from families that have lived in disadvantaged environments the 
longest.iv  
 
Despite this sobering finding, it is important to bring attention to several positive 
developments that have taken place in urban neighborhoods over time. Segregation 
between black and white Americans has been falling, albeit gradually, since the 1980s.v 
The level of violence in American cities has plummeted since the early 1990s.vi And 
many major cities have thrived in the new global economy, becoming hubs of 
innovation and economic growth.vii These are tremendously important changes that 
have transformed many cities and neighborhoods all over the country.  
 
 
 
1 
 
But while it is important to recognize this progress, we must acknowledge the new 
challenges that continue to undermine strong communities. As income inequality in the 
nation has increased, rich and poor families have increasingly moved apart, sorting into 
separate communities. In 1970, about 15 percent of American families lived in 
neighborhoods that were either extremely affluent or extremely poor. By 2012, that 
figure had risen to 34 percent of families.viii While several coastal and  Sunbelt cities like 
New York, Los Angeles, San Diego, Washington D.C., and Phoenix have attracted 
newcomers who have higher income and more education than those who are leaving 
the same cities, Rust Belt cities like Detroit, Columbus, Pittsburgh and Cleveland have 
seen higher-income, better-educated residents leave and lower-income residents move 
in.ix As a result, metropolitan areas have begun to look more and more different from 
each other, some with bustling economies offering relatively high-paid jobs, others 
depressed and isolated from economic opportunity.x This development means that as 
income and wealth inequality have continued to rise, economic opportunity is 
concentrated in some sections of the country and is mostly absent in others that have 
been left behind.  
 
As regional inequality has increased, long-range geographic mobility has fallen. From 
the late 1940s through the 1970s, about 20 percent of Americans moved residences in a 
given year, over 6 percent made a residential move across county lines, and between 3 
and 4 percent moved to a different state.xi Since the 1970s, year-to-year migration has 
declined steadily. Roughly 11 percent of Americans now move each year, less than 4 
percent make longer range moves that bring them across county lines, and less than 2 
percent move into a different state. Individuals who leave their home states to take 
advantage of opportunities elsewhere in the country do better on almost every measure 
of economic status compared to their peers who remain in the state in which they were 
born, but this form of long-range migration has become less common for more 
disadvantaged groups like racial and ethnic minorities and less-educated segments of 
the population.xii Throughout most of the 20th Century African Americans were 
substantially more likely than whites to make long range moves that cross-state lines, 
but this changed in the most recent generation. Since the 1970s, for the first time in a 
century, African Americans were much less likely than whites to make the type of long-
distance moves that have always been a mechanism for economic mobility.xiii  
 
Let me summarize the challenges facing America’s communities. Children’s 
neighborhoods have a powerful impact on their chances in life. Neighborhood 
inequality remains severe, it is multigenerational, and the consequences are cumulative. 
New gaps between thriving and struggling towns, cities, and commuting zones are 
growing. And the type of long-range migration that allows Americans to take 
advantage of new opportunities in new places is becoming less common, particularly 
among the least advantaged segments of the population.  
 
2 
 
How should we respond? Before considering options, it is useful to first consider what 
brought us here. As the manufacturing sector shrunk and urban labor markets began to 
change from the 1950s to the 1980s, a set of social problems like pollution, fiscal stress, 
segregation, joblessness, and poverty became concentrated in central cities. Our 
response was not a national project of investment in urban neighborhoods to respond to 
these challenges. Instead, our response was to abandon central cities, to withdraw 
resources, to expand the criminal justice system, and to provide incentives, through 
home mortgage provision, highway construction and other mechanisms, for 
advantaged segments of the population to leave central cities and head to the 
suburbs.xiv The share of federal funding going to city budgets plummeted.xv Public 
housing in central cities deteriorated, public schools crumbled, fiscal conditions 
worsened, neighborhoods emptied out, institutions like churches and community 
organizations withered away. This is what happens when communities are abandoned.  
 
If we want to build stronger communities, three approaches are possible. One approach 
is to dismantle or scale back the policies that have reinforced and exacerbated 
geographic inequality and limited the chance for all Americans to gain access to high-
opportunity communities. Several options are available, including all of the following: 
scaling back land use restrictions that limit the development of affordable housing and 
implementing mandatory inclusionary zoning policies; ending the mortgage interest 
deduction and reinvesting government revenue lost to this regressive tax policy into 
affordable housing development and rental vouchers; providing incentives for 
coordinated metropolitan-wide plans for transportation, housing, education, and 
economic development; and taking aggressive steps to end discrimination in the 
housing and lending markets.xvi  
 
A second approach is to take steps to allow families to make residential moves that lead 
them into areas with greater opportunity. Results from the many housing mobility 
programs that have been implemented and evaluated over time have been mixed, and 
suggest that the programs with the greatest capacity to generate sustained changes in 
families’ environments are those that target families with young children and those 
who live in the most disadvantaged and most violent neighborhoods; programs with 
administrators committed to searching for and identifying housing units with 
responsible landlords in neighborhoods across the metropolitan area, or beyond, rather 
than leaving families to navigate the low-rent housing market on their own; and 
programs that have the resources to provide extensive supports to families to help them 
with transportation, school searches, child care, and employment, giving families a 
better chance to successfully integrate into and thrive in new communities.xvii 
Additionally, we should encourage policy reforms that reduce the barriers families face 
in making long-range moves, such as scaling back occupational licensing regulations 
that vary across states, and working to make all forms of housing assistance 
portable.xviii  
 
3 
 
The third and most promising approach, which has never been attempted over the last 
fifty years, is to shift from a model of community abandonment to a model of 
community investment. In the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey on Community 
and Society, a national sample of respondents was asked what makes a community 
successful. The two top responses were “Good local schools” and “Having libraries and 
community centers nearby.”xix A great deal of evidence suggests the respondents are 
right. The most effective way to build stronger communities is to invest in core public 
institutions like schools and libraries, and public amenities like parks and playgrounds, 
that bring people together in shared spaces. Let me provide examples. A large-scale 
program of investment in public libraries would allow these institutions to play an even 
larger role as centers of community life, providing crucial services to residents in shared 
spaces all over the country.xx Investment in law enforcement is needed to allow police 
officers to rebuild trust and legitimacy in places where the bond between the police and 
the community is broken.xxi Investment in nonprofit organizations, including religious 
congregations and faith-based organizations, business improvement districts, addiction 
treatment services, mental and physical health providers, prisoner reentry programs, 
child care providers, mentorship and after-school programs, would make every 
community less vulnerable to the next crisis to hit America’s neighborhoods.  
 
In short, the best way to create stronger communities is to invest in the people, the 
institutions, and the local organizations that provide the foundation for community life.

Opening Statement  
JEC Hearing on “Expanding Opportunity by 
Strengthening Families, Communities, and Civil 
Society” 
April 30, 2019, 10:00am 
216 Hart Senate Office Building 
 
Good morning, and welcome to this hearing of the Joint 
Economic Committee. 
To begin, I’d like to welcome back the members of this 
committee from the previous Congress, as well as our new 
members; and I’d like to congratulate Representative 
Maloney on her return as Vice Chair this Congress. I look 
forward to working with all of you. 
The topic of this hearing – expanding opportunity – is in 
many ways a quintessentially American topic. As Abraham 
Lincoln put so eloquently, the leading object of our 
government has been to “elevate the condition of men—to 
lift artificial weights from all shoulders—to clear the paths 
of laudable pursuit for all—to afford all, an unfettered start, 
Page 1 of 5 
 
and a fair chance in the race of life.” In other words, to 
remove barriers to opportunity.  
Often, however, policymakers have a limited 
understanding of what opportunity is. We sometimes see 
opportunity purely in terms of economic outcomes – 
namely, educational or financial success. And moreover, 
we can view financial capital as the only important source 
of wealth on which opportunity depends.  
Economic wealth is no doubt important, and it is right that 
the federal government should seek to remove barriers to 
it. But to see opportunity exclusively in those terms fails to 
capture an invaluable source of wealth on which human 
beings draw, and one that is in fact key to expanding 
opportunity: social capital.  
Social capital is the wealth produced from our 
associational life – what we do together. It inheres in the 
web of social relationships through which we pursue joint 
endeavors, and it comes from our families, communities, 
workplaces, churches, rotary clubs, and little leagues. And 
Page 2 of 5 
 
it is through these institutions of civil society that we make 
a happy and productive life with other people. They shape 
our characters and capacities, help us address the 
challenges we face in life, and provide us with meaning 
and purpose.  
For the past two years, the “Social Capital Project” of the 
Joint Economic Committee has documented trends in our 
associational life and its distribution across the country. It 
has studied the evolving nature, quality, and the 
importance of our associational life; and the relationship it 
has to different problems our nation is facing.  
The Joint Economic Committee has recently undertaken 
the work of exploring the connection between opportunity 
and social capital. And it has found that opportunity is 
largely dependent on social capital, available to us through 
the relationships we have with our families, friends, 
neighbors, fellow congregants, and coworkers. These 
relationships are crucial for both our economic 
opportunities and our opportunity for producing and 
Page 3 of 5 
 
sustaining a vibrant, healthy, and meaningful community 
life. 
And so the goal of the JEC is now to craft policies rooted 
in social capital – policies that will expand opportunity for 
all Americans by strengthening families, communities, and 
civil society.  
This undertaking will not be without its challenges. After 
all, social capital is not something we can see, touch, or 
directly measure. In addition to difficulties of 
measurement, there are also difficulties in establishing its 
causal importance. And while policy can certainly help 
promote the bases for a flourishing civil society, we must 
also inevitably confront its limits, and determine when and 
to what extent the federal government has a part to play in 
this project and the extent to which it is inflicting harm.  
To bound the types of policies under consideration, and 
based on the past two years of its research, the Project 
has identified five broad goals related to opportunity: 
making it more affordable to raise a family, increasing how 
Page 4 of 5 
 
many children are raised by happily married parents, 
connecting more people to work, improving the 
effectiveness of investments in youth and young adults, 
and rebuilding civil society. 
Our distinguished panelists will help us to shed light on 
these issues and questions today. I look forward to 
hearing their testimony, and to seeing the fruits of our 
discussion going forward. 
I now recognize Senator Hassan for opening remarks.

Senator Hassan opening remarks at JEC Hearing on Expanding Opportunity by Strengthening 
Families, Communities, and Civil Society:  
  
Thank you, Chairman Lee, and thank you for holding a hearing in which we can examine 
innovative ways to increase economic opportunity in all of our communities. 
  
And I want to thank all of the witnesses for being with us today. 
  
I want to focus today on how we can create opportunity for entrepreneurs by increasing their 
access to social connections and personal networks - or, in other words, by helping build their 
“social capital.” 
  
Entrepreneurs frequently use their personal connections to identify business opportunities, find 
community mentors, and secure the capital that they need to launch and grow their startups. 
  
However, not everyone starts off with connections to the business community, and 
entrepreneurs outside these informal networks can find it harder to access vital resources like 
financial counselling and capital investment. 
  
This presents particular challenges for women entrepreneurs. 
  
Last year, the National Women’s Business Council issued a report that found that women’s 
personal networks have fewer connections with ties to resources like financial capital. 
  
This is also an acutely important issue for entrepreneurs in rural areas of my state. 
  
In rural areas, there is often extremely limited access to high quality, affordable broadband 
internet, which is an absolute necessity for any business hoping to compete in the modern 
economy. 
  
Limited broadband access slows entrepreneurship and contributes to the so-called “brain 
drain” - a problem for rural areas that I know, Mr. Chairman, you focused on in a report on 
social capital released just last week by this Committee. 
  
Fortunately, there are successful initiatives that Congress can build on. 
  
In New Hampshire, we have many non-profit organizations and business incubators that are 
leveraging community interest and federal investments to build social capital for entrepreneurs 
from all walks of life. 
  
New Hampshire’s Small Business Development Center provides business advertising and 
mentorship, for example. 
  
Our Regional Development Corporations provide business gap financing, and we have startup 
accelerators that tailor their services in innovative ways. 
  
So there are many programs already underway in the Granite State that can serve as models for 
our efforts to expand opportunity for entrepreneurs, and I expect there are models in lots of 
other states as well. 
  
In my view, having the opportunity to start and grow a business shouldn’t be all about “who 
you know.” 
  
Equality of opportunity for entrepreneurs should be predicated on a willingness to work hard to 
transform an innovative idea into a reality. 
  
The bottom line is that we must do more to level the playing field and help aspiring business 
owners build social capital. 
  
Our country was founded on the idea that nurturing the talent and the energy of every person 
promotes human dignity and ignites a vibrant and competitive economy, and government 
certainly has a role in ensuring that we do just that. 
  
When we bring people in from the margins, our communities, our democracy, and our 
economy all benefit; we thrive and we build a strong future for our children. 
  
So, I look forward to our witnesses’ testimony today on how we can help all Americans build 
social capital. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

“The Economic Impact of America’s Failure to Contain the Coronavirus” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  1 
What went wrong with the COVID-19 response in the U.S.? How did it compare to other 
countries? What are the economic costs of this failure? 
 
Introduction 
 
Our nation has suffered immensely from the coronavirus pandemic, losing over 200,000 of 
our fellow citizens. More Americans have been infected with and have died from this virus than 
citizens of any other nation in the world. With tens of millions of Americans losing their jobs and 
millions of small businesses shutting their doors, many of them permanently, the economic costs 
of this pandemic have been massive as well.1,2  
Why has the U.S. response been so poor? Largely, we have failed to implement decisive, 
evidence-driven policies, which has resulted in poor virus control and led to large outbreaks across 
our country. This failure, on top of the underlying, long-standing lack of investment in our public 
health infrastructure, has resulted in America now representing 1 in 4 deaths worldwide from this 
pandemic. Probing deeper, there are three key points that I believe are critical as we consider the 
human and economic costs of our response to the pandemic. 
First, most developed nations and many developing nations have done a far better job 
controlling the spread of SARS-CoV2 than we have. Second, there is no trade-off between 
controlling the spread of this virus and economic health. Indeed, much of the evidence suggests 
that nations who did a better job controlling the virus have had smaller hits to their economies and 
are currently suffering less than those countries who have done a poorer job. Finally, if our goal is 
to preserve lives and livelihoods, Congress can enable a path forward that will allow us to keep 
people safe, open our economies, and get people back to work. 
 
Shortcomings of the U.S. Response 
 
Relative to other nations, the U.S. COVID-19 response has fallen short. Responses to a 
disease outbreak can be divided into two main categories: public health efforts that control virus 
spread and biomedical responses that mitigate the harms of infection. We have done a relatively 
poor job on the former and a relatively good job on the latter.   
Key parts of an effective public health response include social distancing, wearing masks, 
and establishing a robust testing and tracing infrastructure. Social distancing prevents the spread 
of the virus by ensuring that infected people do not get close to non-infected people. Lockdowns 
are the most extreme and harmful form of social distancing and should be used rarely and with full 
acknowledgment of the costs they incur. Over the past 6 months, we have come to learn much 
more about the spread of the virus and now know that the virus spreads most efficiently when large 
numbers of people gather indoors for extended periods of time. Even without a full lockdown, 
limiting large indoor gatherings provides considerable value in limiting viral transmission. 
Another way to slow spread is by universal mask-wearing. As the CDC and others have 
acknowledged, asymptomatic individuals are major spreaders of this disease and can do so through 
laughing, talking, or even just breathing. Masks dramatically reduce droplet and aerosolized 
transmission. When everyone in a setting is wearing a mask, the spread of the virus, even in close 
contact, is very low. 
Finally, a key approach to separating infected people from non-infected people is through 
testing, tracing, and supportive isolation.  The notion here is simple – when we have extensive 
testing deployed in key areas, we are able to identify who is infected and who is not. By identifying 
  2 
those who are infected, we can isolate them and prevent them from infecting others. By tracing 
their contacts, we can identify others who might have been infected and prevent them from 
infecting others as well.  This is a longstanding public health strategy that has worked in a variety 
of disease outbreaks and can be, when deployed properly, quite effective. 
 
Though it is clear that these three factors are critical to a successful public health response, 
the U.S. has failed to execute in each of these areas. First, a lack of federal leadership and guidance 
led to a national shutdown that was uncoordinated, fragmented, and incomplete. Some state leaders 
opened slowly and carefully, allowing science and data to drive their decisions. This ultimately 
allowed them to gradually revive their economies while keeping infections at bay. Others moved 
hastily and carelessly, rushing to reopen businesses as local case counts continued to climb. These 
rushed actions eventually led to outbreaks and further economic devastation. 
 
Second, our federal leadership provided unclear guidance on mask-wearing in the early 
days of the pandemic and has continually failed to implement universal masking policies. It was 
not until April 3, 2020, that the CDC began to urge the general public to wear masks, after weeks 
of stating that masks were not an effective way to protect oneself from the virus.3,4 While the 
association between mask mandates and a decline in daily COVID-19 growth has been well 
established, currently, only 34 states and the District of Columbia require face coverings in 
public.5,6 Uncoordinated policies and a lack of clear guidance have left us with a patchwork of 
protection when it comes to masking which hindered and continues to impede our national 
response.  
 
And finally, at the core of the U.S. COVID-19 response failure is our continued inability 
to test, trace, and isolate infected individuals. Our testing infrastructure has been inadequate from 
the beginning, starting with the CDC’s decision to create and distribute its own COVID-19 
diagnostic testing instead of using the widely available test approved by the WHO. The CDC’s 
test was soon found to produce inconclusive results, and by mid-February, amidst vigorous 
undetected viral spread, the U.S. was only testing about 100 samples per day.7,8 Right now, the 
U.S. is testing more individuals than ever; this past Saturday, just over 1 million samples were 
processed in a single day.9 While this certainly reflects a trend in the right direction, it should not 
have taken nine months to get to this point, and the U.S. continues to fall behind necessary targets 
for disease suppression.10 It is important to note, too, that the distribution of tests in the U.S. is far 
from equal: some labs across the country are overwhelmed with tests, providing results many days 
after the test is taken, reducing the value of the test, while others sit idle with excess capacity.14 In 
addition, our country has failed to fund and implement a national contact tracing program, which 
has consequently forced each state to develop its own strategy. This has left many states without 
an adequate contact tracing workforce and unequipped to trace and isolate contacts of infected 
individuals.11  
 
While the U.S. public health response has been relatively poor, we have demonstrated 
notable success in our biomedical response. We have rapidly developed new technologies and 
innovations, allowing us to lessen the harms of infection and reduce mortality rates. According to 
data from the CDC, the death rate for pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 has fallen from 23.6% 
back in April to 6.2% this past week.12 This is at least in part attributable to improved treatments 
and therapies, such as Remdesivir, an antiviral medication approved by an Emergency Use 
  3 
Authorization in May that has demonstrated reduced mortality and improved clinical recovery 
compared with the standard-of-care. Not only has the U.S. rapidly created novel therapies and 
treatments for COVID-19, but it has also worked toward the rapid development of a COVID-19 
vaccine, leveraging our best academic institutions alongside the private sector. We have devoted 
substantial financial capital to vaccine development through Operation Warp Speed, investing over 
$10  billion  in  eight  different  vaccine  candidates.13  While  our  country  has  demonstrated 
considerable biomedical advances and innovation in recent months, these developments are 
rendered useless when they are not paired with an effective public health response. In order for 
our  country  to  successfully  combat  this  virus,  we  must  simultaneously  invest  in  both  our 
biomedical and our public health responses. 
 
All of these issues can be attributed to the lack of effective guidance and leadership from 
the federal government. The lack of a national testing or contact tracing plan, the inadequate 
response from the FDA, and the stifling of the C.D.C. and its valuable data have all contributed to 
the poor U.S. response to the pandemic and unnecessarily cost thousands of American lives. 
 
The lack of federal leadership in the control and suppression of COVID-19 has also had large, 
negative effects on our economy. Early and sustained failures to test, trace, and isolate cases of 
COVID-19 have necessitated the use of harsher, more impactful measures to control the spread of 
the virus: school and business closures, stay-at-home orders, and physical distancing. These 
actions, many of which would have likely been avoided or significantly reduced by earlier decisive 
federal intervention, have precipitated the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. To 
make matters worse, many strategies aimed at restoring the U.S. economy have not been driven 
by data, resulting in avoidable and unnecessary spikes in cases and deaths.  
 
Nine months since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States, our testing and 
contact tracing infrastructure remain weak, our economy is still suffering, and we continue to lead 
the world in cases and deaths. It is time for a different strategy. 
 
Effective Strategies Around the Globe 
 
As the pandemic has played out around the world, the extent of devastation and impact of 
the virus in each country has been largely determined by local leadership decisions. In mid-March, 
for example, the U.S. and South Korea had the same number of COVID-19 fatalities. Only a few 
weeks later, the course of the pandemic in these countries diverged substantially, with South Korea 
experiencing a total of 85 fatalities compared to the U.S.’s 62,000.16 The difference between the 
two countries lies in what actions the leaders took in those few weeks. 
 
While the U.S. response has proven disastrous, other countries have conceived relatively 
successful strategies for containment and control of the virus. For example, Germany, South 
Korea, and Japan have each employed effective responses to the virus and avoided unnecessary 
suffering and death. These countries implemented many of the beneficial strategies that our 
country neglected: rapid scaling of testing and contact tracing programs, clear messaging and 
educational campaigns, and swift, decisive actions to limit disease transmission. 
 
  4 
  In Germany, rapid and early development of diagnostic tests, diversification of testing 
resources, and increased testing proportional to easing of restrictions has yielded a relatively low 
death rate compared to its OECD neighbors (11.32 deaths per 100,000 compared to 65.27 in Spain, 
62.94 in the U.K., 60.90 in the U.S., and 46.66 in France).1 Additionally, many attribute the clear 
communication and decisive leadership of science-trained Chancellor Angela Merkel as a main 
driver of the country’s relative success in controlling the pandemic.17,18 
 
In  South  Korea,  early,  frequent,  widely-available  testing  and  isolation––coupled  with  a 
rigorous contact tracing infrastructure––led to rapid suppression. In addition, South Korea did not 
limit testing to symptomatic patients, and isolated specific hospitals to care only for COVID-19 
patients. In early March, South Korea was testing more than 10,000 people per day, while the U.S. 
had only tested about 2,000 people in total. Today, South Korea has just under 23,000 total 
infections with only 383 fatalities.18 
 
In Japan, an analog contact tracing system began in January, immediately after confirmation 
of the first infections. Utilizing this cluster-based approach early in the pandemic, Japan was able 
to conserve testing resources by pinpointing areas of infection and testing widely within those 
specific communities. Individuals that tested positive were then sent to hospitals designated for 
COVID-19 care, so as to reduce community spread within the healthcare system. In contrast to the 
U.S. response, Japan ensured clear communication and community education were central to their 
suppression efforts: the government utilized the straightforward messaging of the “Three C’s – 
closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings” to ensure that citizens understood how 
to best abide by social distancing protocols. With about 40% of the population size of the U.S., 
Japan today has just under 80,000 total cases and 1,508 fatalities.18-20 
 
The Economic Costs of an Ineffective Response 
 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have pushed back against the false dichotomy 
between saving lives and saving the economy. I believe, and the data bear this out, that a third path 
– where we prioritize public health and economic well-being simultaneously is the best approach. 
Here, we can keep Americans healthy while also allowing businesses and workplaces to largely 
remain open. While many have argued that we must choose between protecting our health and 
protecting our livelihoods, the data show quite the opposite.  
 
Countries with some of the largest economic declines in Q2 of 2020 are also the ones with 
the highest COVID-19 death rates (Figure 1). Peru, for example, one of the countries that has been 
hit the hardest by the pandemic with a death rate of 868 per million, has experienced one of the 
most severe economic downturns: about 30% contraction. This pattern holds true regardless of 
population or GDP. The United Kingdom, for instance, has one of the highest death rates in the 
world (615 deaths per million), and has similarly experienced 21.7% GDP contraction compared 
to Q2 2019. In the U.S., we have experienced 552 deaths per million and an economic decline of 
9.5% of GDP growth compared to 2019. In contrast, South Korea, aided by a data-driven rapid 
response to COVID-19, has experienced 6.3 deaths per million and a decline of only 3% of GDP 
growth.21 Japan and Germany, with GDP contractions of 10% and 11.7%, and 10 and 110 deaths 
per million, respectively, also follow this trend, albeit to different degrees. 
 
  5 
 
  Figure 1: Economic decline in second quarter of 2020 vs rate of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 
 
Similar trends are clear when we consider unemployment rates this year in the U.S. 
compared with those in other countries. The increase in unemployment rates in the U.S. from 
January to April was 11 times larger than the average in other wealthy OECD nations. From 
January to July, U.S. unemployment claim increases remained five times larger than the average 
of other countries. In both unemployment rates and total per capita COVID-19 cases, the U.S. has 
performed significantly worse than any other wealthy OECD country.22 
 
The data reveal that there is no health-economy trade-off from COVID-19: countries with 
the least-effective public health responses to the pandemic are those whose economies suffer the 
most (Figure 1). However, it must be noted that a public health crisis of this scale does not spare 
any economy in its entirety, regardless of response efficacy. 
 
Early this month, Australia fell into recession for the first time since 1991. Despite a 
moderately strong initial response to the pandemic bolstered by the formation of a National 
Cabinet and strict lockdowns, the economy shrank 7% during Q2, the worst performance since the 
government began keeping records in 1959. Though recent outbreaks have necessitated strict 
lockdowns in certain areas, Australia has fared quite well in context: just under 27,000 total cases 
and 849 deaths in a country of 25 million. Economists and experts agree, though, that despite the 
current economy (which is among the lowest contractions in the OECD wealthy nations), Australia 
  6 
is well poised to bounce back from this recession, thanks in part to its continued efforts in 
suppressing the virus.23,24 
 
Likewise, New Zealand, whose strong and early suppression  strategies have  set the 
international gold standard for pandemic response, is also experiencing economic contraction. In 
Q2, New Zealand’s GDP shrank by 12.2%, its first recession since 2009 and worst since 1987. 
Strict national lockdown measures, widespread testing and contact tracing, and decisive, evidence-
based action by government leaders allowed New Zealand, a country of just under 5 million, to 
essentially declare the pandemic over on June 8 of this year, only 103 days, 1,815 cases, and 25 
deaths after its first identified case. While seven weeks of a national stay-at-home order certainly 
had negative short-term impacts on the economy, government officials and outside economists 
agree that the country’s success in virus suppression will lead to a fast, strong, and possibly record-
breaking economic recovery.25,26 
 
Conclusion 
 
At this most precarious and uncertain time in our nation’s and our world’s history, we owe 
it to our fellow citizens to act expeditiously and steadfastly in our quest to end the COVID-19 
pandemic. Nine months since our first confirmed case, we continue to feel the painful effects of a 
disjointed and, at times, absent, federal response to the pandemic in this country. Tens of millions 
of Americans remain out of work, millions are sick, and hundreds of thousands are dead. We have 
no national testing strategy, receive muddled guidance from our federal health agencies, and our 
economy is in its worst state since the Great Depression of 1929. Let me be clear: this does not 
have to continue. 
 
We know from data and from the experiences of other countries that successful COVID-
19 suppression and long-term economic prosperity are not mutually exclusive. As other countries 
have shown us, we do not have to choose between the value of a human life and the value of an 
economy. There is another way, whereupon we can prioritize both the well-being of American 
citizens and the well-being of the American economy. To do so, we must critically re-evaluate our 
own practices and re-energize organizations and individuals across the country. We must adapt to 
the  new  economic  landscape  of  COVID-19,  re-evaluating  our  personal,  professional,  and 
governmental roles in society. Above all else, we must prioritize the lives and livelihood of our 
fellow Americans. 
 
If we wish to save our economy and our citizens, we must act now.

Hearing by the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee 
September 22, 2020 
Austan D. Goolsbee, Robert P. Gwinn Professor of Economics, University of Chicago, Booth School of 
Business 
Thank you Vice Chair Beyer and Chair Lee for having me in to testify today. You are meeting on a 
critically important topic and one that could not be more important for the economy. 
I wanted to highlight some findings from recent economic research, my own and the work of others, 
that could have bearing on your deliberations. They relate to the unprecedented recession associated 
with the arrival of COVID in the United States.  
I warned at the beginning of March in my Economic View column in The New York Times that the 
structure of our economy meant we would be particularly vulnerable to an outbreak of COVID.1 Because 
so much of our economy is centered on service sector industries and exactly the kinds of activities that 
people withdraw from when there is an infectious disease, I warned that the economic impact could 
actually be even worse here than in China where the disease had been economically quite severe. Sadly, 
my warning came to pass. 
The overwhelming evidence from across the U.S. and across countries in the world supports what I call 
the #1 rule of virus economics: the best thing you can do for the economy is to control the rate of 
spread of the virus.  
It’s important for everyone to understand that decisions about the economy are not made by mayors 
and governors and presidents. People make decisions about whether they feel safe and that is what 
drives the economy. The virus is the boss.  
In my research with Chad Syverson, we got data on consumer visits to 2.5 million businesses across the 
country in 110 different industries. 2 We wanted to know how important lockdowns were for the 
unprecedented collapse in consumer activity during the outbreak of the pandemic. The problem is, 
when the disease is spreading, people stay home, the economy craters and the local authorities impose 
lockdowns. This can make it look like lockdown decisions are driving things but it’s misleading because 
the policy itself is not the driver. The virus is. 
To get around this problem, we compared places in the same week in the same metro area where one 
side of a border had a lockdown policy and the other side did not--places like the Quad Cities where 
Moline and Rock Island, Illinois faced lockdown orders while across the river, Bettendorf and Davenport, 
Iowa didn’t. And if you look in the hundreds of places like that, you see that activity collapsed on both 
sides of the border by almost identical amounts. It wasn’t about lockdowns. It was about fear of the

2020.

virus. If you don’t control for the fear, you would conclude that lockdowns cut activity by 70%. If you 
isolate just the part that came from the lockdown, it’s closer to 7%. 
It’s why in the data you see that when places repeal their lockdown orders, activity doesn’t shoot back 
up. It basically comes back only about 7%--just like we estimate it went down. 
The critically important thing is to actually control the spread of the virus. As long as people fear that 
they will bump into contagious people who do not know they have the disease, economic activity is 
going to be depressed. Testing, tracing, masks, medical equipment—anything you can do to reduce the 
rate of spread of the infection—are the keys to improving the economy.  
If you compare the US experience to other advanced countries, it is quite clear that places that focused 
on slowing the disease have both had fewer deaths and their economies have suffered less. The US 
response has been plagued with conflicting goals and direction from the beginning. For every move that 
has helped fight COVID, there have been multiple moves that have undermined public trust in the 
system or even encouraged people to take actions that increased the spread of the virus.  
It doesn’t have to be this way. It’s not too late to get control of the virus. Even without a vaccine, if you 
can slow the rate of spread of the virus enough, the disease becomes a dying fire. When the rate goes 
up enough, it is a nuclear explosion.  
Our relief payments and rescue packages are important to deal with the potentially permanent scars 
from this temporary shock. But nothing is more important than slowing the virus.

Instead,  the  existing  pandemic  programs

congressional response should remain targeted 
at  containing  the  virus  and  streamlining 
programs that already exist, rather than creating 
new complexity. If Congress decides extended 
business subsidies are necessary, relief should 
be targeted through just one program, such as a 
streamlined version of the employee retention

will not save struggling industries unless people 
are  willing  and  able  to  return  to  their

Re: “The Economic Impact of America’s Failure to Contain the 
Coronavirus” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice-Chairman, members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to 
testify. 
 
My name is Jeffrey A. Singer. I have been practicing general surgery in Phoenix, Arizona for 
more than 35 years, and I am a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute where I work in the 
Department of Health Policy Studies. America’s encounter with the COVID-19 pandemic has 
exposed many flaws in the health care regulatory infrastructure, both on the federal level and the 
state and local level, that impeded a quick and nimble response to the public health emergency. I 
have been asked to provide my perspective, as a health care practitioner and policy analyst, to 
assist this committee in its reassessment of existing policies, with the goal of improving 
readiness as well as access to health care before, during, and after the next public health 
emergency.  
 
The Food and Drug Administration’s test approval process resulted in an avoidable and costly 
delay in getting test kits out to the general public, delaying an effective response to the COVID-
19 pandemic by more than a month.  By contrast, South Korea, having learned from it 
1
experience with the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2015, enacted a 
reform giving almost immediate approval to testing systems developed in the private sector 
during an emergency.  
2
 
Eventually, the FDA permitted states to independently approve tests for use within their own 
borders even if the tests had not yet received FDA approval.  This temporary emergency action 
3
allowed several states that were hard-hit by the pandemic to rapidly ramp up testing. In some 
instances, states imported tests in use and of proven quality from other countries. When the 
public health crisis recedes, FDA testing policy should not return to the status quo ante. The 
devolution of authority to the states should remain in effect whether or not a public health 
emergency exists. 
 
In 2018 Congress passed the “Right to Try” Act in support of the right of the people to try 
medications that may save their lives, even if they weren’t approved by a federal agency. 
A bipartisan Congress and President understood that people must not be prevented by the 
government from making an informed decision to try a drug to save their lives.  
 
As coronavirus cases began to spring up outside of China, including a small number in the U.S., 
the FDA should have sought to ameliorate the shortage of test kits by granting authorization for 
the use of tests already being used in similar countries. Just as people have the right to try 
medications in order to save their lives, they also have the right to try tests aimed at saving their 
lives. 
 
Congress should pass legislation giving reciprocal approval to drugs and medical devices (which 
includes tests) in similar countries.  Reciprocal approval already exists among the European 
4
Union states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.  In July 2019 Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) 
5
introduced S.2161, the Reciprocity Ensures Streamlined Use of Lifesaving Treatment (RESULT) 
Act, which would allow for the marketing of drugs approved in certain countries, but not yet 
approved by the FDA, if “there is an unmet need.”  While this is indeed a step in the right 
6
direction, in the interest of promoting competition and consumer choice, reciprocal approval 
should not be contingent on an unmet need. 
 
Along those same lines, and in keeping with the FDA emergency authorization permitting states 
to decide the COVID-19 tests marketed within their borders, Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX), Kelly 
Loeffler (R-GA), and Mike Braun (R-IN) introduced S.3769, the “Right to Test Act,” which 
would grant such authority to states whenever the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
declares a public health emergency.  However, Congress should consider granting states the 
7
authority to approve drugs and other devices that may be marketed within their borders, 
independent of FDA approval, even when there is not a public health emergency. 
 
The pandemic acutely demonstrated how state licensing laws impede the free flow of health care 
practitioners to where patients need them. In several of the states hardest hit by the pandemic, 
governors suspended state licensing laws allowing practitioners licensed in any state to come to 
the aid of other states’ residents. These emergency actions tacitly recognize a pressing problem: 
state clinician licensing laws block access to care. When the crisis recedes, the state-based 
licensing regime should not return to the status quo ante. 
 
Some states have already enacted laws recognizing the out-of-state occupational and professional 
licenses of those who establish permanent locations within their jurisdictions. In early 2019 
Arizona became the first state to do so, and several other states have since followed suit. The 
remaining states and the District of Columbia should do the same. 
 
Such reform would make it much easier for health care practitioners to provide services to 
patients in various parts of the country. However, the requirement that health care practitioners 
establish permanent locations within respective states renders the reform less effective. For 
greater impact, state lawmakers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia should remove this 
requirement. States would still retain the power, under our federal system, to license and regulate 
occupations and professions within their borders. 
 
Health Care Practice Across State Lines 
 
The social distancing measures required to address the COVID-19 pandemic led to a newfound 
appreciation for the use of telemedicine, a technological advance that has been available for 
several decades. State licensing laws for health care practitioners have impeded the widespread 
use of telemedicine. Most states require that health care practitioners provide telemedicine only 
to patients in the state in which those providers are licensed, a barrier to the free flow of health 
care services across state lines. 
 
Furthermore, patients can travel to another state to receive medical treatment and even surgery 
from a doctor licensed in that state, but those doctors cannot travel to the patients’ states to 
provide the same services unless they are licensed in those states. 
 
While many states suspended the barriers to movement of health care practitioners or the 
delivery of telemedicine across state lines, when this emergency passes, the barriers will return. 
To the extent consistent with its authority to tear down barriers to interstate commerce under 
Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress should define the “locus of care” as the state in 
which the practitioner is located as opposed to the state in which the consumer of the service 
resides. While states have constitutional authority to regulate the practice of medicine for 
residents within their borders, crossing state lines to provide telemedicine or short-term in-person 
care can reasonably be classified as interstate commerce.  This change would increase access to 
8
care and allow patients to utilize expertise that may exist in areas of the country otherwise 
beyond their reach. It would also remove the protection from out-of-state competitors that health 
care providers otherwise enjoy. The increased competition would redound to the benefit of 
patients. 
 
S.3993, introduced in the U.S. Senate on June 17 would define the locus of care as the state in 
which the practitioner is licensed, but would only apply during the course of the current COVID-
19 pandemic and would be limited to telemedicine.  However, Congress should pass legislation 
9
making this definition permanent and not just limited to the duration of the pandemic. Congress 
should also apply this definition of the locus of care to practitioners licensed in one state who 
provide short-term in-person care in a state where they do not have a permanent location. 
Examples of providers to whom such an act would apply include those who usually work 
through agencies to provide care during short, temporary stints in medically underserved areas, 
those located very close to the border of a neighboring state, and out-of-state experts in rare and 
specialized medical conditions brought in to consult and help manage a fragile patient unstable 
for transfer. These examples are analogous to telemedicine practice. 
 
Possessing an out-of-state license would not automatically enable a health care provider to 
practice at any health care facility within a new state. Health care facilities perform their own 
due diligence in vetting and credentialing health care staff applicants. The same vetting process 
could just as easily be performed on an applicant for staff privileges who is licensed in another 
state. That happens now when a provider relocates from another state after obtaining a license in 
the new state. 
 
Defining the locus of practice as the state in which a health care practitioner is licensed would 
make it easier for locum tenens (“fill in”) providers and out-of-state specialists to provide 
itinerant temporary health services to remote and underserved communities, free from the burden 
of licensing applications and fees in the several states where these communities reside. In the 
event that a practitioner establishes an office within a state, the practitioner would then become 
subject to applicable state-based practitioner licensing laws. 
 
Adding Experienced International Medical Graduates to the Provider Pool 
 
State licensing boards require experienced international medical graduates who are licensed in 
other countries to repeat their entire post-graduate training in an accredited U.S. institution 
before receiving a state medical license. Many experienced foreign-trained doctors take ancillary 
medical field positions, such as nurse, lab technician, and radiology technician, instead of 
starting over. Some even work as waiters or taxi drivers.  
 
In Canada, the provinces have control over medical licensing. Several provinces grant licenses to 
experienced immigrant physicians who have completed postgraduate training in any of 29 
approved foreign jurisdictions.  Instead of having to repeat that training, they are required to 
10
pass a “practice readiness assessment,” a relatively short process (usually a few months) 
involving supervision by a licensed practitioner who must clear them as competent. In Nova 
Scotia, for example, family medicine practitioners from other countries may practice under the 
supervision of a licensed physician and, after a designated period, may then independently 
practice in underserved areas.  A similar program exists for specialists who receive their 
11
postgraduate training in countries other than the 29 approved jurisdictions. Australia, New 
Zealand, and most member countries of the European Union have similar provisions for 
admitting experienced foreign health care practitioners into their provider pools. 
 
States should grant reciprocity to health care practitioners licensed in certain other countries with 
reputations for quality medical education and develop programs to facilitate integrating 
practitioners from less advanced countries into the pool of health care providers. Private 
certification organizations could be enlisted to assist in establishing criteria. 
 
Certificate of Need Laws 
 
More than three decades since repeal of the 1974 federal law that incentivized states to establish 
“Certificate of Need” (CON) requirements before new health care facilities can develop, or 
existing ones can add beds or equipment, CON requirements still exist to varying degrees in 38 
states. These CON commissions are heavily influenced by incumbent health care providers. 
Attempts to reform or repeal them are often met by fierce resistance from the incumbents who 
try to make the case that they only have the interests of the general public in mind. CON laws 
render state health care systems sclerotic and unable to rapidly adjust their infrastructure to meet 
the changing demands of public health emergencies. Many governors suspended CON laws 
during the public health emergency. The CON laws in those states and in the states where they 
were not suspended should be formally repealed by state legislators.  
12
 
The Joint Economic Committee and the relevant committees in the U.S Senate and House of 
Representatives should investigate whether state Certificate of Need Laws, as well as state 
licensing laws, constitute antitrust violations. Individual members of Congress or Congress as a 
whole should direct the Federal Trade Commission to use its existing authority to enhance 
scrutiny of these state laws. 
 
Trade-offs 
 
Finally, I would like to address the matter of trade-offs. All decisions in life involve trade-offs. 
As a medical doctor, when I advise my patients, I strive to avoid the tendency to focus 
exclusively on physical health considerations, while neglecting to give proper consideration to 
any economic, psychosocial, or other trade-offs my patients may face. 
 
While the harmful effects of the pandemic occur in real time, the public health consequences of 
many pandemic policy trade-offs may not be immediately apparent but are nonetheless 
extremely damaging. It is important for policymakers to be sensitive to both the seen and the 
unseen consequences of pandemic policy. 
 
Unseen public health consequences include the uncountable thousands people who will die from 
chronic illnesses and would have remained healthy had they been able to keep their routine 
medical appointments; the advanced cases of cancer that occurred due to bans on screening 
procedures and biopsies; the emergencies that arose because of moratoria on necessary elective 
medical procedures such as coronary bypass and organ transplants; and the many additions to the 
rising suicide rate in all age groups including those who suffer alone in pain because of closed 
pain clinics, social distancing, and shelter‐in‐place orders. Also unseen are those suffering from 
depression and other mental health disorders whose conditions become exacerbated due to 
mandated isolation. Down-the-road consequences include increased numbers of people with 
substance use disorders and drug overdoses, as well as increased cases of spousal and child 
abuse; and stunted cognitive and social development in young children deprived of in-person 
schooling. There is also the risk that many old pandemics might make their return because of the 
thousands of children missing crucial immunizations against even more deadly and contagious 
pathogens. 
 
Economic trade-offs factor into the social determinants of health. Never seen will be the 
individuals who won’t have careers or jobs, the small business that will never open, and the hard-
earned life savings that will never materialize due to the destruction that comes from stopping an 
economy. None of this will show up in any statistics.  
 
Government officials are people, and rational people respond to incentives. A drop in new 
COVID-19 cases and fatalities in the wake of lockdown orders increases the likelihood of public 
approval and reelection. Inaction risks criticism and political punishment. The disparity between 
what is seen and what is not seen means that government officials have incentives to be overly 
cautious and impose more restrictions for longer lengths of time than what may really be 
necessary. That’s why it is crucial to minimize the amount of decision‐making authority vested 
in just one person. 
 
An understanding of this dynamic should inform policy regarding public health emergencies 
going forward. Central governments and public health officials should use a light touch when 
responding to public health emergencies. On all levels of government, one‐size‐fits‐all measures 
should be kept to a minimum, and civil society should be informed, guided, and entrusted to 
work out suitable solutions. Responses should be targeted, nuanced, flexible, and easily adjust to 
changes on the ground based upon local knowledge.

58,Hearing: The Economic Impact of America’s Failure to Contain the Coronavirus, https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/76241e95-a2a4-4412-b61f-50633b4c2787/jec-hearing-statement----vc-don-beyer-09-22-2020.pdf,"
 
 
The Economic Impact of America’s Failure to Contain the Coronavirus 
Vice Chair Don Beyer -- Prepared Remarks 
 
Today’s hearing will be unlike almost every hearing ever held by the U.S. 
Congress Joint Economic Committee. 
Most often, our hearings explore economic issues. Today, we will focus on public 
health. 
When the explosion of coronavirus cases in March caused massive unemployment 
in April, JEC Democrats reached out to some of the most prominent economists 
and public health experts in the country. 
Two Nobel-prize laureates, two winners of the John Bates Clark medal, five 
former Chairs of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers and three former 
Presidents of the National Economic Association—over two dozen in all. 
Every one of them conveyed the same urgent message—the top priority for healing 
our crippled economy is to contain the coronavirus. 
Economist Austan Goolsbee, here with us today, has put it this way: “the number 
one rule of virus economics is that you have to stop the virus before you can do 
anything about economics.” 
Cases and deaths 
And yet, tragically, we have failed to control the coronavirus. 
200,000 Americans are dead—more than in World War I, the Korean War and 
Vietnam combined. 
The United States has only 4% of the world’s population but approximately 21% 
of worldwide deaths. 
There have been almost 7 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United 
States—this likely is a severe undercount. 
And the number of cases continues to explode, with about 40,000 new positive 
tests a day. 
 
The Economic Impact of America’s Failure to Contain the Coronavirus – Opening Remarks 
 
 
The economy has been hit hard 
As a result of this crisis, our economy has suffered a severe blow.  
There are nearly 12 million fewer jobs today than in February. 
The official unemployment rate is 8.4%—almost two and a half times what it was 
in February.  
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says that the actual rate could be 3% 
higher due to problems with misclassifying workers and differentiating those who 
have left the labor force from the unemployed. 
3.4 million U.S. workers are now permanently unemployed—and the number is 
rising. 
Almost 30 million depend on an unemployment check to survive. 
The President is the problem 
200,000 deaths, economic devastation, a contagion still out of control. 
Tragically, no one person in our country is more responsible than the person who 
should be leading the fight to contain the coronavirus. 
The President of the United States. 
The President’s lies cause preventable deaths 
President Trump’s record on the coronavirus is a stunning mix of incompetence, 
ignorance and callous disregard for human life. 
He lied to Americans, telling them that the virus was a “Democratic hoax” and that 
it would “magically disappear.”  
At the same time, he privately admitted to Bob Woodward that the coronavirus 
was five times as deadly as serious strains of the flu—“deadly stuff.” 
The President refused to take action quickly 
The President should have used the early weeks of the crisis to test for and trace 
the virus, purchase PPE and ventilators, and to educate the public about the steps 
all Americans should take to protect themselves and others.  
Page 2 
The Economic Impact of America’s Failure to Contain the Coronavirus – Opening Remarks 
 
 
However, it took more than seven weeks after the first confirmed case in the 
United States for him to declare a national emergency.  
If America had moved a week or two sooner to implement social distancing 
measures, it would have saved tens of thousands of lives, according to research 
from Columbia University. 
Trump ignores public health experts 
The President ignored the advice of public health experts. He said that he knew 
more about public health than they did. 
He mocked people who wore masks and he refused to wear one, despite the fact 
that masks can play an important role in slowing the spread of the virus.  
He endangered people’s lives by promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine, which 
has been shown by scientists to have no impact on treating COVID and carries 
substantial risks.  
He recommended injecting disinfectant to fight the virus—and sadly, some 
Americans did. 
He claimed that children are “almost immune.” 
In every case, the President was wrong—dead wrong. 
Trump pushed aggressively for premature reopening 
Public health officials argued that reopening prematurely would lead to a second 
wave of infections and deaths.  
But the President ignored them. He said in March that “we cannot let the cure be 
worse than the problem itself.” 
He goaded governors to reopen the economy.  
He told Americans that public health measures were tyranny: he said to “liberate 
Michigan” while supporters demonstrated (with guns) at state capitals. 
And he held large political rallies, defying experts, who warned that these could 
become super-spreading events. 
As a result of these reckless and callous actions, coronavirus cases spiked and 
people died. 
Page 3 
The Economic Impact of America’s Failure to Contain the Coronavirus – Opening Remarks 
 
 
The number of new infections on Labor Day were double what they were on 
Memorial Day. 40,000 new cases per day. 
The President’s gamble 
The President’s insistence on prematurely reopening the economy had a self-
serving purpose—to make the economy look stronger in the months leading to 
Election Day. 
As Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell pointed out back in April, it was 
a big gamble—a gamble with American lives. A gamble with the U.S. economy. 
The gamble already has resulted in more cases and more deaths, but in the short 
term it made the economy look better. 
Between May and August, the economy regained about half of the jobs lost.  
The unemployment rate dropped from almost 15% to 8.4%—still about 2.5 times 
higher than in February. 
The President is betting that the next jobs numbers, when they are released next 
Friday, will continue to show marginal improvement…. 
…. And that the cost of reopening too soon won’t be obvious until after the 
election.  
While we don’t know what the numbers will reveal, one thing is certain: the true 
impact of the President’s gamble won’t be evident until it’s too late. 
Trump’s economic legacy 
Donald Trump holds the vast power of the U.S. Presidency—but he has refused to 
use it. 
He has not contained the coronavirus, but has unleashed it. 
As a result, many more lives will be lost. 
And in the long term, the economy will suffer.  
The President’s failure to make even the most meager effort to contain the 
coronavirus is his economic legacy. 
I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses.

JEC Hearing Opening Statement: 
“The Economic Effects of America’s Failure to Contain the Coronavirus” 
Sen. Mike Lee 
September 22, 2020 
 
 
Thank you, Vice Chair Beyer, for chairing today’s hearing on this important topic. 
 
The novel coronavirus, as it has swept across the nation and the world this year, has left a trail 
of devastation in its wake. It has imposed not only serious physical disease, but severe 
economic ills, as well. Jobs have been lost, businesses have been shuttered, and whole sectors 
of industry have been disrupted.   
 
In response to such an unprecedented crisis, we have taken unprecedented government action. 
But, as in the successful treatment of any illness, we must first make sure that we are using the 
proper remedies.   
 
So as we take stock of our response to the current pandemic, we should consider how policy 
has both hurt and helped so far, and what we can improve to have the right solutions going 
forward – for this public health crisis and the next.  
 
While some have called for a still more aggressive federal response through more stimulus, a 
nationally coordinated response led by the administration, and more widespread lockdowns, 
the benefits of such policies must be weighed against both their economic costs and their 
unintended consequences. 
 
For instance, we know that large scale stimulus exacerbates our already whopping national 
debt and can crowd out private investment. Additionally, the enhanced unemployment benefits 
included in the CARES Act provided a disincentive for those who are unemployed to return to 
work, thus inhibiting economic recovery. 
 
In addition to economic devastation, lockdowns have had other negative effects. Mandated 
isolation has spurred or worsened mental health issues for many people; and stopped others 
from getting routine health screenings and vaccinations, causing death or illness that otherwise 
might have been prevented. 
 
In fact, as the second wave of the coronavirus has been rebounding across Europe, the 
continent’s governments are now intent on avoiding large-scale lockdowns and instead 
focusing on tailored, localized measures to combat outbreaks, based on the knowledge we have 
today on how to best manage infections. 
 
Finally, we ought to make sure that the federal policy is not inhibiting sound and effective 
solutions. Unfortunately, evidence shows that it already has – especially in the early days of the 
crisis. For instance, outdated “Certificate of Need” rules prevented hospitals from acquiring 
new beds and equipment; and the FDA and CDC laws against at-home testing posed an early 
barrier to disease control. But perhaps the worst failure of all was that the sheer bureaucratic 
chaos that fatefully delayed effective testing for an entire month. 
 
Thankfully, we have already removed some regulations that were impeding a more effective 
pandemic response. Two important changes have been allowing doctors to practice medicine 
across state lines, as well as allowing doctors to provide telemedicine. This is exactly the kind of 
regulatory flexibility we should consider going forward so that we can quickly, creatively, and 
freely administer care to those who need it. 
 
As we continue to respond to the coronavirus, we must acknowledge the ways that sweeping, 
centralized, “one-size-fits all” government policies can ultimately worsen our attempts at 
recovery.   
 
If we are to have flexibility and resiliency – in the face of this crisis and the next – we ought to 
instead empower our states and localities, who best understand their own resources, needs, 
and communities. 
 
The American people have always played a critical role in governing locally, volunteering, and 
innovating to respond in times of crisis. I look forward to hearing our panelist’s contributions 
today as to how we can continue doing just that.

60,Hearing: Reducing Uncertainty and Restoring Confidence during the Coronavirus Recession,https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/271c2553-ba6f-4b18-bd3e-23e9f7607465/jared-bernstein-testimony-jec-july-30-2020-final.pdf,"
Reducing Uncertainty and Restoring Confidence During the Coronavirus Recession 
Jared Bernstein1 
7/28/2020 
Thank you, Vice Chair Beyer and Chairman Lee, for the opportunity to testify before you today. 
The U.S. economy is in a precarious place. More specifically, because of the pandemic-induced recession 
and the ongoing failure to control the spread of the coronavirus, tens of millions of Americans continue 
to experience severe disruptions to their lives and their living standards. New evidence shows that many 
risk hunger and eviction. Over 30 million people—almost 20 percent of the current labor force—claimed 
unemployment benefits in recent weeks, and as members of this committee well know, they all 
potentially face a huge, negative shock to their incomes should their enhanced benefits expire a few 
days from now. 
Small businesses are closing at an accelerated rate, business bankruptcies are up 26 percent from a year 
ago, and a whopping 80 percent of the U.S. population live in places where economic activity is once 
again retrenching due the spread of the coronavirus. High frequency indicators of face-to-face 
commerce such as personal mobility, visits to restaurants, and travel—the type of activities most at risk 
in the age of the virus—are now showing sharp reversals from earlier progress. Up-to-the-minute labor 
market indicators (“real-time” data) suggest there is a fair chance that after strong job growth in May 
and June, payrolls in July may have contracted, on net. 
These unsettling trends are shaking the confidence of American businesses and households, while 
leading to great uncertainty about what the future holds. Furloughed employees worry about 
transitioning to the ranks of the permanently unemployed. Working parents with young children are 
fraught with uncertainty about school restarting in the fall, wondering what sort of childcare 
arrangement they’ll need if schools remain even partially shut down. Businesses large and small are 
unable to reliably forecast revenues, invest in the future, or even know if they can make it for another 
month. State and local governments are facing their largest shortfalls in years, leading to job losses and 
great uncertainty regarding their outlook. And whatever burdens Americans face on average, they are 
far more significant for persons of color, who have been disproportionately hit by both the virus and its 
economic impact. 
The single message of my testimony is that Congress must do all it can to reduce this uncertainty and 
give the American people reason to believe that the federal government is their reliable partner. They 
need to see that members of this body will work together with the requisite urgency to help them and 
their families and their businesses make it through to the other side of this crisis. I discuss the policies I 
believe would be most helpful to get there, policies chosen to both be responsive to the diagnosis 
offered below, and policies that have a positive track record. I understand and respect that others will 
have different ideas. 
But what is not debatable is that the American people and the economy once again need your help and 
there is no plausible reason for such help to be delayed. In fact, to do so unnecessarily boosts

1 
 
uncertainty, reduces consumer and business confidence, while prolonging the pandemic, the downturn, 
and avoidable human suffering. 
The Economic Outlook   
I begin with a set of figures showing the failure of virus control and its correlate, the challenging 
economic outlook. The data reveal both near-term economic weakness, as commerce recedes in the 
face of spiking virus cases, and longer-term weakness, as expectations are that the economy will remain 
weak for numerous years to come: 
--The first set of figures—total confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. and other advanced economies—
shows the extent to which the U.S. is an outlier in terms of the sharply rising trend of new cases. 
Because they’ve more effectively controlled the virus, the downturn was often far less negative in these 
other countries. In Germany, for example, the most recent unemployment rate was 6.2 percent in May, 
when the U.S. jobless rate was more than twice that level, at 13.3 percent (the German jobless rate was 
also held by policy that kept workers connected to jobs, even at much reduced hours, an idea I endorse 
below). 
--The next figure shows why the U.S. economy has stalled in recent weeks, and why indicators that were 
improving are now flattening or reversing. The figure shows that as of the second half of this month, 
states containing 80 percent of the U.S. population were either holding off on opening up commerce of 
reversing earlier re-openings. This is a sharp reversal from a month ago. 
--The next figure presents a set of bullet points based on “high-frequency” indicators, to provide the 
committee with some of the most up-to-date data points on the stalling economy: 
•  Last week’s unemployment insurance (UI) claims report showed that for the first time in 15 
weeks, initial claims (people applying for UI) went up, in this case by about 100,000. 
•  Over 30 million people are claiming UI benefits, many orders of magnitude above the historical 
average. 
•  Analysts believe there’s a 50/50 chance that the jobs report, out on August 7th, will show that 
the number of jobs declined in July. 
•  The number of small businesses open in mid-July compared to January fell 16 percent in New 
York and California, and 18 percent in Texas. 
•  In mid-July, 33 percent of renters (46 percent for Blacks and Latinos) indicated concern over 
ability to pay their rent at the same time many eviction moratoriums are expiring.  
The final two figures are intended to provide a longer-term view of the economic outlook, using CBO’s 
most up-to-date forecast. The unemployment rate figure, on the left, shows the jobless rate to be 
elevated for years to come, and not expected to fall below 5 percent until 2027. The figure on the right 
shows the real GDP output gap: the difference between CBO’s forecast of real GDP and its estimate of 
GDP at full capacity. This year, the gap amounts to $1.4 trillion, or over $11,000 per household. Of 
course, these costs are not distributed on a per capita basis, and instead fall disproportionately on these 
least able to bear them: low-income families with no savings to fall back on, low-wage, displaced 
workers, and persons of color. 
2 
 
The Policy Response 
There are three distinct but related policy reactions that must continue to be taken during this crisis: the 
health care response, the monetary response, and the fiscal response. Given the urgency of the next 
relief package, currently under debate in the Congress, my testimony will largely focus on the latter. 
As an economist, I will say little about the virus-control policies required by the health response. That 
said, I consider effective virus control far and away the most essential missing factor in the current and 
near-term-future economy. Mayors, governors, and even presidents can urge people to “get out there 
and spend,” but if majorities don’t believe they can safely engage in commerce at pre-crisis levels, 
evidence shows that official admonitions will not change their minds.  
Simply put, no virus control, no economic recovery. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell got this 
sequencing right when he recently said: “The virus is going to dictate the timetable here. The first order 
of business will be to get the spread of the virus under control, and then resume economic activity.” 
Speaking of the Fed, monetary policy is of course another essential line of defense and the central bank 
has done a good job thus far of providing support to credit markets and making sure the benchmark 
interest rate they control stays low. Some of the Fed’s lending facilities, especially those in the Main St. 
Lending Program, have provided less support to businesses than I expected and hoped for. But even 
here, part of the purpose of these programs was to maintain low-cost credit to the full range of 
borrowers, from individuals to small businesses to corporations to municipalities, and based on 
diminished spreads of the relevant interest rates, that goal largely appears to be met thus far. 
One of the goals of the Fed’s monetary policy creates a useful bridge to my main discussion about fiscal 
policy: the reduction of uncertainty in financial markets, something the Fed tries to achieve through 
“forward guidance” (telegraphing their thinking and plans to market participants). As this issue of 
uncertainty is the topic of this hearing, I will spend a few moments reviewing its relevance to economic 
outcomes. 
It has long been recognized that people’s expectations about the future have a significant impact on 
their economic activity. A firm that foresees strong future demand for its product or service is far more 
likely to invest in expanded productive capacity than a firm that perceives declining demand. A 
breadwinner who is uncertain whether she’ll still have her job next month is less likely to make an 
investment or plan a vacation than a person with strong job security. A parent who doesn’t know 
whether her child will be in school or daycare a few weeks hence will worry about her ability to meet 
the demands of her job.  
In a particularly timely example, a low-income, unemployed renter who doesn’t know how much she’ll 
receive in unemployment insurance next week may be uncertain about making her August rent. This, in 
turn, leads to chain of downstream uncertainties. Her landlord may be unable to make her mortgage 
payment and this, in turn, would be a stressor for the landlord’s lender.  
In other words, uncertainties don’t just generate personal insecurities. They generate negative 
economic multipliers and policy should thus do all it can to diminish them. I’ve already emphasized the 
importance of Congressional support for measures to reduce the spread of the virus, but it is also the 
case that the delay in the next relief package is another, totally avoidable source of uncertainty.

Expiring Pandemic Unemployment Compensation: Bad Micro, Bad Macro 
A striking example of ramping up of unnecessary uncertainty, one with significant economic costs, is the 
high likelihood that enhanced unemployment benefits—the $600 plus-up from the CARES Act, called 
Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (PUC)—will very likely expire at the end of this month, as 
legislated in the CARES Act. Though economists and policy makers have different views about what the 
next extension should be, few believe that full expiration is warranted, either on a micro or macro level. 
The good news is that Congressional majorities appear to agree with the need to extend enhanced 
benefits. The bad news is that the debate over the issue started too late to avoid expiration. It is also of 
great concern that the Republican proposal in their new HEALS Act—cutting the $600 weekly plus-up to 
$200 and then requiring states to hit a 70 percent replacement rate2—represent a large benefit cut to 
25 million jobless persons and their families at a time when the economy and job market are clearly 
weakening. On average, the $600 to $200 cut would lower weekly benefits by 43 percent, according to 
UI expert Andrew Stettner. In Utah, Chairman Lee, average benefits would fall 42 percent; in Virginia, 
Vice-chair Beyer, they’d fall 47 percent. 
From a micro-perspective, unemployed families, especially those with low incomes, will risk significant 
hardship due to these losses. The 11 percent jobless rate and the fact that, as noted above, employment 
growth appears to be slowing, means that job seekers are in an unforgiving game of musical chairs, with 
far more players than seats. It is also the case that those in the bottom half of the income scale, 
disproportionately persons of color, have virtually no savings to fall back on. When they lose their 
paychecks, they face hunger and eviction. 
Evidence from Farrell et al show how important enhanced UI benefits have been to recipients, as 
reflected by their spending. They find that “Households that receive benefits soon after job loss show no 
relative decline in spending, while households that wait two months to receive benefits due to 
processing delays have large spending declines.” They also found that compared to still employed 
workers, job losers experience spending declines averaging 20 percent before they received UI benefits. 
“This suggests,” they wrote, “that delays have imposed substantial hardship on benefit recipients.” 
This last finding, regarding the hardship, and, I would add, the uncertainty invoked by delays in benefit 
receipt, should be at the top of mind of policy makers as the enhanced PUC benefits expire at the end of 
this month. As analysts from the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities recently documented, the 
weakening economy is contribution to growing hardships among vulnerable families, disproportionately 
families of color. According to surveys on data from earlier this month, “About 26 million adults — 10.8 
percent of all adults in the country — reported that their household sometimes or often didn’t have 
enough to eat in the last seven days…The rates were more than twice as high for Black and Latino 
respondents (20 and 19 percent, respectively) as for white respondents (7 percent)…An estimated 13.1 
million adults who live in rental housing — 1 in 5 adult renters — were behind on rent for the week 
ending July 7. Here, too, the rates were much higher for Black (30 percent) and Latino (23 percent) 
renters than white (13 percent) renters.” These figures are significantly higher for families with children.  
                                                            
2 UI experts are highly skeptical that state UI offices can pull off this change in two months.

As discussed below, these hardships underscore the need for measures to both expand nutritional 
support (SNAP) and rental support, both of which were in the House-passed HEROES Act. But they also 
elevate the risk factors invoked by allowing enhanced benefits to expire. 
Because PUC takes the UI replacement rate to above 100 percent for most recipients—the median 
replacement rate is 134 percent—some critics of PUC have argued that it is creating a disincentive to 
work. While there is, of course, logic to this claim, it is an empirical question which must be evaluated 
given the starkly over-supplied condition of the U.S. labor market. Work disincentives are a lot less biting 
when there’s not enough work. 
In fact, various empirical facts challenge the disincentive story, all of which are more consistent with a 
labor market characterized by weak demand. For example, if current employers were competing with UI 
benefits, we would expect to see wage pressure among low-wage workers, as they have the highest 
PUC-induced replacement rates. But, controlling for distortionary composition effects, researchers at 
Goldman Sachs find low-wage trends doing slightly worse than higher-wage trends. Similarly, they find 
that workers who were temporarily laid off and then rehired have smaller wage gains relative to those 
who weren’t laid off, again, the opposite prediction of the crowd-out theory. They conclude that there is 
“little evidence that either generous unemployment benefits or hazard pay have raised overall wages 
meaningfully.” 
Economist Ernie Tedeschi asked a related question: do we observe diminished transitions from UI to 
work in places where replacement rates are highest? He does so using micro-data on labor market 
transitions in May and June, finding “no evidence of any effect on labor market flows from more 
generous UI.” That is, the correlation between the replacement rate and the likelihood of transition to 
work was statistically insignificant (and, in some of his analysis, had the “wrong” sign, i.e., positive). 
Tedeschi also found that among those who left the UI rolls for work in June, almost 70 percent were 
making more on UI than in the prior job. Bartik et al engage in a related analysis and find “no evidence 
to support the view that the temporary $600 supplement, which meant many workers received benefits 
higher than their wages, drove job losses or slowed rehiring substantially.” 
Weak labor demand is, as noted, a key factor in these findings, but so are UI rules that recipients must 
accept a “suitable job” if one is offered. Both these facts imply that PUC-induced work disincentives 
could become more evident if our virus control policies improve, allowing for increased commerce. That 
speaks to the need for a dynamic, or “triggering” UI policy, where replacement rates fall as 
unemployment improves. Such a policy is especially notable in the context of this hearing, as it would 
reduce the uncertainty faced by tens of millions of Americans about the fate of this critical source of 
income. In this regard, making fiscal policy conditional on economic conditions is analogous to the 
“forward guidance” provided by the Federal Reserve, wherein they telegraph, to the extent practicable, 
their policy intentions to financial market participants. Such guidance has been found to be a powerful 
tool in meeting the Fed’s mandate by setting expectations and, key to our discussion today: reducing 
uncertainty. 
Triggering legislation has been proposed by, among others, Vice Chair Beyer, and it has been challenged 
by those who argue that conditioning replacement rates on unemployment rates will just keep 
unemployment high as those with high replacement rates will refuse to seek work. However, UI rules 
and some of the proposals are designed to obviate this concern. First, as noted above, recipients must 
accept suitable job offers or lose benefits. Second, some proposals gradually reduce enhanced benefits 
5 
 
when virus control takes holds and the national emergency is declared over, at which point UI search 
requirements will also likely be reinstated.  
Bottom line, unemployment will fall when labor demand returns in earnest, post virus-control or 
vaccine. Until then, we should be mindful of potential work disincentives, but should definitely not 
assume their presence without empirical evidence. 
From a macro perspective, an expiration or even significant reduction of PUC would constitute a large, 
negative shock to an economy that is, as shown above, already operating far below capacity. On an 
annualized basis—meaning if these benefits were in effect for a year—the Bureau of Economic Analysis 
found that PUC amounted to about $840 billion (almost 4 percent of GDP), or $70 billion per month in 
May. Relative to maintaining the program for the rest of this year, allowing PUC to expire would be likely 
to lower real GDP by over 1 percent, cost more than a million jobs, and push up the unemployment rate 
by a bit less than 1 percentage point. In their July forecast, the CBO predicted the unemployment rate 
would be 10.5 percent in the last quarter of this year. These estimates suggest if PUC expires, the rate 
could be above 11 percent, probably comparable to its current level of 11.1 percent.  
As noted, Senate Republicans have suggested reducing PUC from $600 per week to $200. The following 
table, prepared by economist Mark Zandi, shows the extent of real GDP and job losses, and the increase 
in the unemployment rate throughout the rest of the year based on incremental reductions from the 
$600 plus-up. For example, Zandi finds that taking the PUC down from $600 to $200 (see circled section 
in figure), is expected to reduce real GDP by 1 percent, jobs by about 1 million, and raise the 
unemployment rate by about 0.6 of a percentage point. Full expiration, should it lastingly occur, would 
lead to even larger losses, as shown in the figure. The bottom line is simple: such losses can and should 
be avoided. 
Most Effective Measures for the Next Relief Package 
The above analysis serves as a diagnosis of current conditions and suggests measures Congress should 
take as they design the next relief package. As the economy stalls due to inadequate virus control, 
concerns about hardships faced by vulnerable families loom large and must be foremost in considering 
specific policy interventions. Key areas include: 
Evictions: As state and local eviction moratoria expire, policy measures to prevent renters’ evictions and 
foreclosures for homeowners. As noted, there is increasing insecurity in this area. Also, while Congress is 
reportedly considering a new eviction moratorium in the next relief bill, my understanding is that this 
measure would require beneficiaries to pay back accumulated rent once the moratorium is over. This 
not  only implies a large, future demand on the incomes of vulnerable households; it also could 
undermine any positive economic impact of the moratorium, as renters are forced to save more and 
consume less than is good for their families or for the broader. To avoid this possibility, fiscal relief in 
this space is necessary such as the House’s HEROES included fulsome anti-eviction proposals, including 
“$100 billion in emergency rental assistance through the “Emergency Rental Assistance Act and Rental 
Market Stabilization Act.” 
Nutritional support:  The HEROES Act also included a much-needed 15 percent temporary increase in 
SNAP benefits. Economists have consistently found SNAP benefits to have a relatively large economic 
6 
 
multiplier, as benefits are a) quickly spent, creating more demand in the economy’s food sector and b) 
are fungible, helping to free up other spending for low-income families. 
Restore PUC enhanced UI benefits: As discussed in detail above, extending the weekly expansion at 
$600 per week is highly warranted and would not, based on evidence thus far, generate significant work 
disincentives. However, this disincentive would become more important as the job market improved, 
which motivates proposals to reduce the enhanced benefits as state labor market indicators improve. 
State and local fiscal support: From what I glean from newspaper accounts, the next package may omit 
new fiscal relief for state and local governments, instead providing more flexibility on how states can 
spend previously legislated funds. This would be an egregious omission. As members know, these sub-
national entities, which have recently shed 1.5 million jobs even while other sectors were adding 
employment, cannot run budget deficits. Their budgets are severely impaired, far more so than in the 
last downturn. In that recession, fiscal support through expanded FMAP was a highly useful tool for 
reducing layoffs of public workers and another policy that was found to have high multiplier effects. 
Support for vulnerable businesses with difficulty accessing credit: The sharp and sudden losses in 
revenues to many American businesses has been a huge source of stress, especially to smaller firms 
without ready access to credit. Even various government and Federal Reserve lending programs have 
mostly required businesses to go through banks to get the funds they need to survive, and for un- and 
underbanked businesses, particularly minority-owned firms, this barrier has been insurmountable. 
While the Paycheck Protection Program has had some success, I urge members of the committee to 
consider other proposals that seek to keep workers connected jobs—employee retention programs—in 
some cases through credits or grants to employers. As myself and co-authors I recently wrote in a 
review of these proposals, “By keeping workers on the job—or enabling employers to rehire them—an 
employee retention program would provide effective and cost-efficient support to workers and 
businesses. It would also help to facilitate the economy’s full recovery.” That is, research shows 
downturns where otherwise solvent companies were helped to survive the recession were followed by 
stronger recoveries. As noted above, Germany has long and effectively applied policies that kept 
workers connected to their firms, even at reduced hours. Such a policy, called “work-sharing,” exists in 
the U.S. context as part of our UI program, but while its use has grown considerably in the current 
downturn, it is still a tiny part of our support system. Administratively, to the extent that retention 
programs can deliver government grants versus bank loans, they will both be much more accessible and 
useful to vulnerable, small businesses. 
Public Debt 
Before concluding, I wanted to suggest that members of the committee not undercut the urgency of this 
moment due to concerns about the fiscal position of the federal government. There is little question 
that our public deficits and debt are headed for record territory as a share of GDP, with the latter—debt 
held by the public as a share of GDP—likely surpassing the record peak set in 1946 of 106 percent. Back 
then, we were fighting fascism; now, we’re fighting a deadly, highly contagious microbe, and both call 
for whatever temporary measures are necessary to protect our citizens and get to the other side of the 
crisis.  
We are fortunate, in this regard, that interest rates on government debt are, and are expected to 
remain, very low in historical terms. Since 1990, the average yield on a 5-year Treasury has been about 4 
7 
 
percent (the average Treasury debt maturity is about 5 years). As of this writing, that yield is 0.3 
percent, meaning that debt service as a share of GDP is also historically low. Indeed, compelling research 
shows that in weak economies like ours today, not taking actions to pull forward the next expansion can 
be more damaging to our fiscal accounts than engaging robust measures of the type discussed herein. 
Simply put, the correct question about the current deficit is not “is it too big?” but “is it big enough to 
fully offset the demand contraction?” 
Of course, none of this should be taken to imply that deficits do not matter. I have often testified before 
Congress stressing that as economies close in on full capacity, fiscal consolidation should occur, as 
private sector growth generates enough revenues to help chip away at the primary deficit. In this 
regard, our most pressing, recent fiscal problem is not that our deficits are growing now, as they should. 
It’s that the were growing before the pandemic induced recession, as the economy was closing in on full 
employment. As I have argued before, this troubling imbalance was far more a function of wasteful, 
regressive tax cuts than it was of extra spending. 
Conclusion 
As we meet today, the absence of effective virus control is causing a reversal of reopenings in 
economies across the country, particularly in areas where the virus is spiking. It is unclear whether 
schools will open in the fall, and many businesses, including travel, tourism, entertainment, restaurants, 
and other face-to-face services remain highly stressed by the pandemic-induced collapse in demand. 
State and local government facing huge budget shortfalls have shed 1.5 million workers since February. 
Insecurity regarding hunger and evictions appears to be rising. Adding to all this uncertainty is the high 
likelihood that even while the July 31st expiration date for the $600 per week PUC plus-up was known to 
every member of Congress, this essential income source for unemployed persons and their families 
could expire in days. 
And while most Americans are experiencing some extent of these problems, they are particularly acute 
for persons and communities of color. 
By working together to quickly implement significant fiscal relief in these and other areas, Congress can 
once again throw struggling people, places, and businesses the lifeline they need to make it to other side 
of this crisis. I’ve argued for, along with uninterrupted enhanced UI benefits, increased nutritional 
support, state and local fiscal relief, and help for smaller, more vulnerable businesses. Shortchanging 
such temporary fiscal relief due to deficit concerns would be, I have argued, highly misguided. 
Finally, while I have tried to mostly stay in my economic lane, I have also stressed in the strongest terms 
that there will be no economic recovery until the virus is under control. This does not imply waiting for a 
vaccine. As I’ve shown, other advanced economies have implemented far more effective virus controls, 
and are therefore much better perched to restart at least some degree of commerce, schooling, and 
other critical aspects of life-before-Covid.  
By forcefully taking charge of the public health aspects of the crisis and by ensuring that fiscal relief will 
be there as long and as deeply as people need it, Congress can help reduce the American people’s 
uncertainty and economic insecurity. I strongly urge you to do so and will be happy to help in any way I 
can.

Heather Boushey 
Washington Center for Equitable Growth 
Testimony before the Joint Economic Committee,  
Hearing on “Reducing Uncertainty and Restoring Confidence During the Coronavirus 
Recession” 
July 28, 2020 
 
 
Thank you, Vice Chair Beyer and Chairman Lee, for inviting me to speak today. It’s an honor to 
be here. 
 
My name is Heather Boushey, and I am president and CEO of the Washington Center for 
Equitable Growth. We launched in November 2013 with the goal of advancing evidence-backed 
ideas and policies in pursuit of strong, stable, and broad-based economic growth. We do this 
through a unique institutional strategy: We fund academics to investigate whether and how 
economic inequality—in all its forms—affects economic growth and stability. We have an open 
and competitive academic grants program that now, in our seventh cycle, has given away about 
$6.5 million to more than 250 scholars nationwide.  
 
What the research now shows is that there are many ways that inequality hurts both families and 
the long-term trajectory of our economy. These long-term trends are inimically tied up in the 
current coronavirus pandemic and resulting recession.  
 
The most important economic uncertainty facing your constituents and our nation is: When will 
the administration and Congress address the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus 
pandemic?  
 
Addressing the administration’s failure to contain the coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease 
caused by the virus, is the only way to fully restore confidence and put us on the path to 
economic recovery. The United States is experiencing the most uncontrolled and deadly outbreak 
of any high-income country in the world. Compared to the European Union, we now record 10 
times as many daily coronavirus cases and COVID-19 deaths. 
 
Until the virus is contained, however, there are key actions that can bolster economic confidence 
and rein in uncertainty. Specifically: 
 
•  Immediately renew the $600 Pandemic Unemployment Compensation payments 
•  Set economic assistance programs, such as Unemployment Insurance, to continue 
automatically until objective economic conditions improve 
•  Pass generous aid for states and localities, which have already shed 1.5 million jobs and 
are bearing the brunt of responding to the pandemic, on the order of the $900 billion in 
the HEROES Act 
•  Resist enacting corporate liability immunity and instead release workplace health 
standards that protect workers’ lives and give employers evidence-based guidance.   
•  Enact other policies to stabilize demand and help those most affected by the crisis, 
including: 
o  Food assistance 
o  Rental assistance and the extension of the eviction moratorium 
o  Direct payments to a broad swathe of low- and moderate-income Americans 
o  Investments in communities of color hit so hard by the coronavirus 
o  Funding to ensure safe and secure elections in November 
o  Help for small businesses 
o  Premium pay to our essential workers 
o  Fixes to the long-term fragilities detailed below that have made us so susceptible 
to this shock 
•  Finally, build the data tools to know how this crisis and recovery are affecting families up 
and down the income ladder by enacting GDP 2.0 measures  
 
The HEROES Act, which was passed by the House more than 2 months ago, contains many of 
these priorities. The Senate should immediately consider passing this bill or a similar bill that 
includes a recently introduced bill from Sens. Schumer and Wyden to peg expanded 
unemployment benefits to the economic conditions in each state. This would allow aid to 
automatically adjust based on objective criteria. Vice Chair Beyer has authored a similar 
proposal. 
 
The coronavirus pandemic abruptly ended of the longest economic recovery in U.S. history. But 
before we get to the current situation, we need to acknowledge that even in those good years, the 
gains from that economic growth weren’t shared. This created systemic fragilities that left us less 
economically resilient and set us up for the multiple failures we are now experiencing. 
 
 
The Roots of this Failure 
 
This immediate failure is the result of a series of decisions made by this administration. But it 
also is the result of decisions made over the past 50 years that have created underlying fragilities 
in our economy and society. These decisions have made our economy less effective in good 
times and less resilient to shocks. 
 
Even as the topline economic markers signaled to policymakers that our economy was growing 
last year—indicators such as a historically low unemployment rate and annual Gross Domestic 
Product growth of around 2 percent—wages were not growing commensurate with a tight labor 
market or at a pace to close our country’s unconscionable longstanding racial income and wealth 
divides. 
 
The fruits of our economic growth, in terms of both income and wealth, were diverging sharply.  
 
  2 
The Federal Reserve Board’s new Distributional Financial Accounts and the latest research by 
University of California, Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman document 
that income inequality remained historically high, and wealth inequality was outpacing it.  
 
Inequality hurts economic growth and mobility. Growth has slowed since 1980, and average 
people no longer share in the growth we do have. The bottom 50 percent of the population has 
the same inflation-adjusted pretax income that they did in 1980, and lower absolute mobility 
means that people born in 1980 now have only a 50 percent chance of surpassing their parents’ 
income.  
 
As I summarize in Unbound: How Inequality Constricts our Economy and What We Can Do 
About It, at Equitable Growth, in our now 7 years of looking at the best economic research, we 
see that inequality constricts growth by: 
 
•  Obstructing the supply of people and ideas into our economy and limiting opportunity for 
those not already at the top, which slows productivity growth over time 
•  Subverting the institutions that manage the market, making our political system 
ineffective and our labor markets dysfunctional 
•  Distorting demand through its effects on consumption and investment, which both drags 
down and destabilizes short- and long-term growth in economic output  
 
As a country, we have put ideology over evidence. We have chosen tax cuts and deregulation 
over investments such as paid family leave, robust social insurance programs, and public 
institutions. We have put our faith in the idea that markets can do the work of governing.  
 
Instead, we should put our economy—and society—on a path where growth is strong, stable, and 
broadly shared. To do that, we need to enact policies that constrain inequality at the top, not 
allowing it to spiral out of control, and giving the beneficiaries of that inequality the power to 
subvert our markets, politics, or economy. And we need to provide counterweights to 
concentrated economic power. As we consider the economy we had at the onset of the pandemic, 
we can see clearly how failures to ensure workers and families, especially Black, Latinx, and 
Native American workers and families, have access to the tools to be healthy and safe—policies 
such as paid sick time, access to affordable healthcare, and well-enforced workplace safety 
standards—made our nation less resilient to this shock. 
 
There are six key factors that made the United States and the U.S. economy particularly 
susceptible to the coronavirus pandemic and COVID-19. Each of them have contributed to the 
current crisis. And if they are not corrected, the United States is likely to experience a slow and 
inequitable economic recovery. 
 
1.  Too many people lack the basic protections that would have slowed the spread of 
the coronavirus 
 
  3 
The gaps in our social insurance systems exacerbated the spread of the coronavirus. The United 
States is behind its peer nations in labor market regulations to protect workers and families, 
including on paid leave, stable schedules, and access to child care. Compounding the problem is 
the lack of health insurance and fear of high medical bills, both of which kept—and are still 
keeping—those who feel sick from seeing a doctor, placing a serious burden on these individuals 
as well as raising rates of transmission.  
 
Research is already showing the significant economic and psychological toll this pandemic is 
taking on workers. These stresses are heightened for people of color and immigrants, who face 
institutional discrimination and are often forced by their already precarious economic straits to 
succumb to workplace abuses at the hands of their employers.  
 
2.  Workers lack the power to share in the gains of the economic expansion that would 
have given them protections and security 
 
Civic institutions—especially labor unions, which once served as voices for many wage-earning 
workers (though never representing all workers)—have suffered a long decline. Now, only 1 out 
of every 16 private-sector workers belongs to a union. On top of this, labor laws and policies 
have failed to reflect the growing role of the fissured workplace in our modern-day economy, 
where firms subcontract pieces of their work so they can avoid responsibility for workers and 
working conditions. 
  
These two debilitating trends in our labor market mean that corporations that are ultimately in 
charge of labor practices and that make the largest profits are not liable for maintaining 21st 
century workplace standards. The coronavirus pandemic exposed the failure of these labor 
market inequalities and the need for workers to manage health crises and family care, as well as 
protect workers against layoffs and the loss of these key health and family benefits.  
 
3.  Decades of stagnant wages and meager workplace benefits leave many families 
without enough savings to weather the coronavirus recession 
 
At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, millions of people across the 
country were one paycheck away from financial catastrophe, even after a decade of economic 
expansion and historically low unemployment. Case in point: Four in 10 adults in the United 
States said that if they had a $400 emergency expense, they would have to borrow, sell 
something, or would not be able to pay it.  
 
As the coronavirus recession continues, more and more workers and their families are robbed 
of buying power, which will undermine one of the key drivers of economic growth—the stable 
incomes that drive consumer spending.  
 
4.  Policymakers starve public goods of investments that would have enabled better 
protections from the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing recession 
  4 
 
Decades of tax cuts, culminating in the sharply regressive Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, have 
fueled a long-term decline in federal revenue that has starved resources that can be used to fund 
critical public investments and basic governmental functions, including in public health. High 
concentrations of income and wealth hamstring our political system because the wealthy dictate 
the legislative agenda and shape news headlines.  
 
Yet these same wealthy elites don’t prioritize investments in public health infrastructure or other 
public goods. Early in this crisis, our neglected Unemployment Insurance system was unable to 
handle millions of Americans losing their jobs. Millions have waited weeks or months as 
decades-old computer systems struggled to process their claims. This dearth of investment is a 
systemic problem in the United States. (See Figure 1.) 
 
Figure 1 
 
 
 
5.  States and localities don’t have the resources to deal with a pandemic or a recession 
 
State and local governments are experiencing sharp drops in their capacity to provide the 
services needed to cope with the coronavirus recession. Already, state and local governments 
have shed 1.5 million jobs. A continuing recession will induce further cuts to health and 
  5 
education and exacerbate the ongoing weaknesses. Austerity in state governments likewise 
disproportionately harms people of color, as public-sector jobs form the basis of a strong middle 
class for Black and Latinx workers.  
 
 
6.  Business concentration across markets increases consumer and small business 
vulnerabilities just when those threats are most dire 
 
Wealthy and powerful corporations use their status to maintain dominance in the marketplace. 
Large businesses and monopolies muscle competitors out of business, suppress wages, 
and hobble innovation. These companies are also precisely the ones that will thrive after the 
coronavirus pandemic passes. Strong cash reserves combined with political influence allow 
entrenched businesses to swoop in when asset prices are low and reshape rules of entire markets 
in the aftermath. The collapse of small businesses will disproportionately hurt people of color for 
whom business ownership is an especially important route to wealth creation and to closing the 
racial wealth gap.  
 
The failure to prevent coronavirus infections and deaths and the ensuing recession 
 
President Donald Trump’s focus is and always has been on the stock market rather than 
conceiving of and effectively implementing a comprehensive and fully thought-out federal plan 
to address the coronavirus pandemic and its economic effects. Case in point: Though the 
administration knew about the threat of the coronavirus in early January and took an early effort 
to limit the transmission into the United States by halting travel from China, where the 
coronavirus first emerged, it did not use that time to prepare sufficient stockpiles of medical and 
protective supplies.  
 
Despite the months that have passed, the administration also has not set up a nationwide system 
to contact trace confirmed COVID-19 cases or given states the resources to do it themselves. 
And tests for the general population still can take a week or more to process and access too often 
varies by race. 
 
Addressing the Immediate Economic Uncertainty 
 
Unemployment Insurance 
 
The largest economic uncertainty facing the United States is whether the Senate will renew the 
$600 increase in weekly unemployment benefits, known as Pandemic Unemployment 
Compensation, or PUC. The Senate majority has refused for months to act to renew this critical 
lifeline despite dire circumstances in the labor market.  
 
In June, more than 11 percent of the workforce was unemployed, while the unemployment rate 
for Black workers was higher than 15 percent and more than 14 percent for Latinx workers. And 
  6 
conditions appear to have worsened in July as COVID-19 cases have resurged and states have 
been forced to re-enter various stages of lockdown. Unemployment claims numbers are rising 
once more, and a new survey from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that a staggering 6.7 million 
jobs have been lost since June.  
 
There is a racial component to the Senate’s refusal to renew the $600 PUC benefit. States with a 
higher share of Black workers tend to have less generous jobless benefits. For Black workers, an 
estimate shows, the average maximum weekly benefit is $40 short of that received by White 
workers. (See Figure 2.)  
 
Figure 2 
 
 
We risk a cascade of economic damage that could be uncontainable if Congress does not act 
immediately to extend the $600 unemployment benefit boost. Families need this benefit to 
sustain them. Their landlords need them to pay their rent, and their local small business owners 
desperately need them to keep ordering take-out and popping by for socially distanced shopping. 
 
  7 
Like a virus out of control, high unemployment spreads economic pain throughout the entire 
community.  
 
Unemployment benefits accounted for 14.6 percent of all wage and salary income in May. 
Failure to extend the $600 boost alone would contract GDP by a rate of 2.5 percent in the second 
half of this year, per an analysis by Harvard University’s Jason Furman. As a percentage, that is 
more than the economy grew in 2019.  
 
Allowing the $600 boost to remain expired would devastate local economies.  
 
Our communities rely on the temporarily unemployed being able to continue spending. States 
where unemployment benefits replace a greater percent of workers’ wages experienced the 
smallest drop in work hours in March—and, as of early June, had the strongest recovery.  
 
There have been unfounded concerns that the $600 boost might be a meaningful disincentive to 
work during this crisis, perversely causing the very economic ailment is it meant to alleviate. 
This is not the case. The ongoing failure to be able to get back to business-as-usual due to the 
out-of-control pandemic, the absence of safe working conditions, a sharp drop in consumer 
spending, and lack of support for parents and caregivers are preventing millions from working, 
not Unemployment Insurance payments.   
 
People are eager to get back to work when they have the opportunity, but there are not enough 
jobs in our labor market. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey shows that there were 
four unemployed people for every job opening in May. Lack of opportunities to work, not a lack 
of eagerness to work, are keeping unemployment elevated. 
 
We can also see this in the population of people who returned to work in May and June after 
being laid off in April. Nearly 70 percent of those who returned to work in May and June did so 
despite the fact that they were making more from Unemployment Insurance than at their job, 
according to analysis by Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI and former Treasury 
economist. (See Figure 3.)  
  8 
Figure 3
 
 
In short, Americans want to work, and they know that a permanent job is more valuable than a 
temporary Unemployment Insurance check. This is one reason why employers are filling their 
scarce open positions faster than at any point since February 2012, as shown in the U.S. job 
vacancy yield. 
 
Automatic Stabilizers 
 
  9 
Nobody knows for sure how long the coronavirus recession will last or exactly how severe it will 
be. The uncertainty that would exist when confronting any recession is compounded by the 
uncertainty about the nature and consequences of the coronavirus itself, including the number of 
people who will die from COVID-19 now and in the future, the short- and long-term health 
impacts of the virus on those who recover, the pace at which treatments and vaccines will be 
developed, and the quality of the public health response. 
 
Enhanced unemployment benefits should end when objective conditions show they are no longer 
needed. An unemployment-rate-based “trigger” that only turns off when a stable recovery is 
underway would allow this program to wind down automatically.  
 
Sens. Schumer and Wyden have introduced a bill that would extend the $600 increase in weekly 
UI benefits beyond July 31, 2020 until a state’s 3-month average total unemployment rate falls 
below 11 percent. The benefit amount then reduces by $100 for every percentage point decrease 
in the state’s unemployment rate, until the rate falls below 6 percent. Vice Chair Beyer has 
sponsored a similar bill in the House. These bills follow the best evidence in research-driven 
policy design, inspired by research on automatic stabilizers from Equitable Growth and the 
Hamilton Project’s book Recession Ready.   
 
State and Local Government Aid 
 
The next priority, if Congress wants to create economic certainty, is to pass fiscal relief for states 
and localities with around $900 billion in aid in the HEROES Act.  
 
States and localities are bearing the brunt of responding to this virus in light of federal inaction. 
They are losing tax revenue and, as a result, have shed 1.5 million jobs so far—even as their 
services are more necessary than ever. These job losses make up a significant portion of the 
overall 12 million jobs permanently lost since February.  
 
With state and local general fund revenues in freefall due to needed increases in spending on 
healthcare and related spending amid plummeting tax revenue, these governments’ budgets are 
on the precipice. State budget shortfalls could total more than $550 billion over the next 3 years, 
nearly double what it was estimated states missed out on in the entire decade following the Great 
Recession more than a decade ago. Fiscal requirements that states balance their budgets are 
already forcing governors to propose cuts in spending that will harm already struggling 
communities. Local governments are, if anything, in an even more challenging economic 
situation.  
 
During the previous recession, these budget cuts proved seriously harmful to the economy. 
Shrinking state and local government budgets during the Great Recession reduced Gross 
Domestic Product by more than three times the size of the cuts themselves, according 
to estimates. 
 
  10 
Other Crucial Policies  
 
Other policy priorities include food assistance, rental assistance and extension of the eviction 
moratorium, investments in communities of color hit hard by the virus, funding to ensure safe 
and secure elections in November, help for small businesses, and premium pay to our essential 
workers. And I urge you not to support enhanced liability protections for big corporations facing 
lawsuits if they put their workers at risk. Federal policymakers need to provide evidence-based 
guidance so firms open safely, not shift risks onto workers. 
 
Finally, Congress should also implement new data tools to measure how the recession and 
recovery will affect people differently up and down the income and wealth ladders. The GDP 2.0 
measure Equitable Growth has proposed, and which I have previously discussed before this 
Committee, will tell us whether families are recovering from the crisis and which need more 
help. We can lay the groundwork now to make sure we understand who benefits from a future 
recovery and what other action is needed. 
 
We can see clearly that markets cannot perform the work of government. Americans need public 
institutions that can protect them from threats to their lives and livelihoods, and provide 
leadership in times of crisis. Our economy and society have a long way to go to get back to full 
health. We have even further to go to implement fixes for our long-running systemic fragilities. I 
thank you for the chance to submit this testimony on how you can do just that.

American	Action	Forum.	I	am	indebted	to	my	colleague	Gordon	Gray	for	many	
valuable	conversations.		
	
	
	
	
Chairman	Lee,	Vice	Chairman	Beyer,	and	Members	of	the	Subcommittee,	thank	you	
for	the	privilege	of	participating	in	this	hearing	on	addressing	the	nation’s	economic	
crisis.	In	this	short	testimony,	I	want	to	make	four	main	points:	
	
•  The	economy	and,	especially,	the	labor	market	entered	2020	in	good	
condition,	but	have	been	buffeted	by	an	economic	downdraft	of	
unprecedented	scale	and	unique	origins;	
	
•  The	policy	response	thus	far	by	the	Federal	Reserve	and	Congress	has	been	
correspondingly	of	unprecedented	scale	and	has	prevented	an	enormous	
amount	of	distress	and	economic	damage;	
	
•  Examining	the	data	from	the	onset	of	the	recession	highlights	the	importance	
of	supply	conditions	and	policies	that	assist	businesses	and	their	customers	
to	operate	in	the	presence	of	the	virus;	and		
	
•  There	does	not	appear	to	be	a	strong	case	for	“automatic	stabilizers”	in	the	
form	of	expanded	mandatory	spending	programs.		
	
Let	me	discuss	these	in	turn.	
	
COVID-19	and	the	Economy	
	
The	macroeconomic	impact	of	the	COVID-19	pandemic	far	exceeds	any	experience	
in	our	lifetimes.	Essentially	all	the	major	leading	economic	indicators	have	seen	
historic	declines,	wiping	out	the	hard-won	gains	from	the	longest	recovery	in	U.S.	
history.	
	
Recent	Economic	Trends	
	
Prior	to	the	pandemic,	there	had	been	a	meaningful	improvement	in	the	persistence	
of	healthy	economic	growth	over	the	past	three	years.	Gross	domestic	product	
(GDP)	growth,	measured	as	the	growth	from	the	same	quarter	in	the	previous	year,	
accelerated	steadily	from	a	low	of	1.3	percent	in	the	2nd	quarter	of	2016	to	a	recent	
peak	of	3.2	percent	in	the	2nd	quarter	of	2018.	Of	note,	throughout	this	period,	GDP	
growth	remained	above	the	1.8	percent	growth	rate	that	prevailed	throughout	the	
balance	of	the	recovery.

In	June	of	2009,	the	United	States	began	the	economic	recovery	from	the	Great	
Recession.	What	followed	was	nearly	11	years	–	the	longest	expansion	in	U.S.	history	
–	of	steady	if	modest	economic	growth.	Over	that	period,	nearly	22	million	jobs	were	
created.	Remarkably,	the	pace	of	job	creation	accelerated	over	the	course	of	the	
recovery.	Over	the	first	half	of	the	recovery,	monthly	job	creation	averaged	138,000;	
this	number	increased	to	198,000	new	jobs	created	per	month	over	the	latter	half	of	
the	recovery.		
	
With	higher	growth	and	tighter	labor	markets,	unemployment	continued	to	fall	as	
payroll	and	wage	growth	have	accelerated.	Wage	growth	has	improved	overall,	
including	for	non-supervisory	workers.	Indeed,	from	December	2018	onward,	
growth	in	hourly	earnings	(on	a	yearly	moving	average)	for	production	and	
nonsupervisory	workers	outpaced	that	of	workers	overall	every	month.

The	economic	story	of	the	recent	past	is	the	realization	of	years	of	modest	growth	
finally	beginning	to	accrue	to	individuals	and	families,	broadly	raising	the	standard	
of	living.	Recent	accelerations	in	that	growth	punctuated	a	return	to	prosperity.	That	
all	came	apart	in	March	of	2020.		
	
The	Economic	Impact	of	COVID-19	
	
The	COVID-19	pandemic	precipitated	a	historic	shuttering	of	the	economy	in	March,	
guaranteeing	that	the	broadest	measure	of	economic	wellbeing	–	real	quarterly	GDP	
growth	–	would	reflect	some	of	the	devastation	in	the	1st	quarter.	Indeed,	the	Bureau	
of	Economic	Analysis’s	(BEA)	estimate	for	the	decline	in	1st		quarter	GDP	is	5.0	
percent	on	an	annualized	basis.	This	is	the	single	largest	drop	in	real	GDP	since	
2008.	While	any	contraction,	particularly	one	on	the	order	of	magnitude	with	those	
observed	during	the	Great	Recession,	is	troubling,	in	this	instance	the	contraction	
reflected	only	the	leading	edge	of	the	economic	devastation.	
	
Higher	frequency	data	reveal	a	historically	devasted	economy.	Payrolls	in	April	fell	
by	20.8	million,	with	private	sector	payrolls	shedding	19.8	million	jobs.	The	service	
sector	lost	over	18.3	million	jobs.	The	leisure	and	hospitality	industries	were	
particularly	devastated,	losing	over	7.5	million	jobs.	Goods-producing	industries	
	
	
saw	a	decline	of	over	2.3	million.	Government	shed	952,000	jobs.	No	industry	saw	
net	positive	hiring.	To	be	sure,	the	last	two	months	have	seen	a	return	to	positive	job	
growth,	with	7.5	million	jobs	added	to	American	payrolls.

The	unemployment	rate	jumped	to	14.7	percent	in	April,	which	exceeds	the	highest	
level	since	the	Great	Depression.	As	the	Bureau	of	Labor	Statistics	notes,	were	it	not	
for	the	classification	of	some	workers	as	employed	but	“Absent	for	other	reasons,”	
this	number	would	be	on	the	order	of	5	percentage	points	higher.	With	the	positive	
job	growth	in	May	and	June,	the	unemployment	rate	has	come	down	somewhat,	
though	at	11.1	it	remains	more	than	a	percentage	point	above	the	levels	of	
unemployment	seen	during	the	Great	Recession.	
	
More	frequent	data	still	–	weekly	unemployment	insurance	(UI)	claims	–	tell	a	
similar	story.	Before	March	of	this	year,	the	single	highest	weekly	initial	claims	
report	was	695,000	in	1982.	No	week	in	recorded	U.S.	history	saw	millions	of	
Americans	claiming	unemployment	insurance	benefits.	In	the	present	environment,	
new	UI	claimants	can	only	be	measured	in	the	millions.

The	upshot	of	the	most	deliberate	and	comprehensive	down	to	the	most	noisy	and	
imperfect	indicators	is	economic	devastation	of	a	singularly	historic	nature,	and	
though	a	recovery	is	underway,	it	will	not	return	the	U.S.	economy	to	“normal”	for	
some	time.	
	
The	Outlook	
	
The	Congressional	Budget	Office	(CBO)	typically	updates	its	economic	forecast	twice	
yearly	–	once	in	January	and	once	in	August.	Before	the	pandemic,	CBO’s	baseline	
was	keyed	off	of	an	economic	forecast	entirely	abstracted	from	the	effects	of	the	
pandemic,	built	on	an	assumption	of	real	GDP	growth	in	2020	of	2.2	percent,	an	
unemployment	rate	of	3.5	percent,	and	slowly	rising	interest	rates.	This	was	a	
mainstream	forecast	for	the	year,	but	to	perform	accurate	cost-estimating	during	
congressional	consideration	of	the	Coronavirus	Aid,	Relief,	and	Economic	Security	
(CARES)	Act,	CBO	had	to	essentially	update	its	forecast	on	the	fly,	and	it	is	to	its	
credit	that	it	did	so.	CBO	has	since	completed	a	complete	10-year	forecast.	
	
The	new	forecast	reflects	a	similar	outlook	to	other	major	post-COVID	analyses	–	a	
sharp	uptick	in	economic	activity	in	the	third	quarter	of	2020	that	only	partially	
restores	the	economic	gains	of	the	past	several	years.	GDP	is	expected	to	fall	10	
	
	
percent	in	the	2nd	quarter,	or	35	percent	at	an	annual	rate.	(For	perspective,	in	1932,	
the	worst	year	of	the	Great	Depression,	GDP	fell	12	percent.)

For	the	entire	year	2020,	GDP	will	be	down	5.1	percent	as	every	component	of

in	2021	every	component	should	be	positive.	The	CBO	sees	growth	at	a	rate	of	4.0	
percent	in	2021.	What	this	means	is	that	despite	a	sharp,	expected	return	to	growth	
in	Q3	of	2020,	the	scale	of	the	prior	contraction	is	such	that	CBO	does	not	forecast

The	implications	of	the	current	and	projected	losses	associated	with	the	COVID	
pandemic	are	highly	consequential	for	federal	policy.	The	CARES	Act	stands	as	the	
single	largest	fiscal	intervention	in	U.S.	history,	an	appropriate	response	to	an	
historic	challenge.	Continual	monitoring	of	the	economic	indicators	–	weekly,	
monthly,	quarterly,	annually	–	will	continue	to	inform	Congress	on	the	direction	and	
tenor	of	the	recovery,	and	policymakers	should	tailor	policies	accordingly.		
	
Next	Steps	for	Fiscal	Policy	
	
The	policy	strategy	thus	far	has	been	to	use	large	amounts	of	Federal	Reserve	
liquidity	provision	and	taxpayer	dollars	to	insulate	to	the	degree	possible	the	
household	and	business	sectors	from	the	effects	of	extreme	social	distancing	and	
quarantine.	As	successful	as	this	approach	has	been,	it	has	come	at	considerable	
economic	cost	and	appears	unsustainable.		
	
Going	forward,	it	will	be	necessary	to	find	a	better	way	to	operate	the	economy	in	
the	presence	of	the	virus.	In	light	of	this,	it	is	useful	to	review	two	charts	from	
Chetty,	et.	al.	The	first,	below,	shows	real-time	data	on	consumer	spending	by	
quartile	and	carries	three	major	lessons.	First,	the	onset	of	the	recession	was	driven	
by	a	sharp	drop	in	spending,	even	though	there	had	not	been	any	decline	in	income.	
	
	
This	is	a	very	different	mechanism	than	was	common	in	20th	century	business	cycles	
(which	were	income-driven)	and	21st	century	business	cycles	(which	thus	far	have	
been	driven	by	financial	bubbles).		
	
The	second	lesson	is	that	the	sharp	pullback	in	spending	was	largely	due	to	high-
income	households.	As	the	chart	shows,	spending	in	the	top	quartile	fell	much	more	
sharply	(31	percent	compared	to	a	year	earlier)	in	late	March	than	in	the	bottom	
quartile	(23	percent).	The	COVID-19	recession	emanated	from	more	affluent	
Americans;	responding	to	it	should	reflect	this	fact.	
	
The	final	lesson	is	that	federal	transfers	–	checks	to	individuals	and	children,	
pandemic	unemployment	insurance	–	shored	up	the	finances	of	lower-income	
consumers	to	such	a	degree	that	by	early	June	their	spending	was	down	by	only	3	
percent	compared	to	2019.	(Indeed,	overall	household	sector	finances	were	
sufficiently	fortified	that	the	saving	rate	was	33	percent	in	April	and	23	percent	in	
May,	putting	roughly	$2	trillion	more	in	household	checking	and	savings	accounts	
compared	to	February.)	But	the	spending	by	higher-income	households	remains	
depressed.	
	
Why?	Unlike	the	previous	recession,	the	big	cutbacks	were	not	in	big-ticket	durable	
items	or	other	non-durable	goods.	Instead,	the	diminished	purchases	of	services	
	
	
was	responsible	for	two-thirds	of	the	decline.	People	stopped	flying	(transportation	
services),	staying	at	hotels	(housing	services),	attending	concerts	and	movies	
(entertainment	services),	and	so	forth.	Indeed,	a	stunning	2	percentage	points	of	the	
5	percentage	point	decline	in	GDP	in	the	first	quarter	was	due	to	reduced	use	of	
health	care	services.	
	
	
The	issue	was	the	fear	of	individuals	to	participate	in	anything	that	involved	
personal	contact.	This	fear	produced	the	downturn,	which	was	exacerbated	by	the	
lockdowns	that	occurred	later.		
	
A	slightly	more	detailed	examination	of	the	data	reveals	that	spending	fell	primarily	
among	high-income	households	for	in-person	services	(e.g.	restaurants)	and	that	
these	services	were	produced	by	low-income	workers	in	small	business	in	these	
high-income	areas.	
	
Traditional	“stimulus”	targeted	at	lower-income	households	will	permit	those	
households	to	spend	more,	but	it	will	not	restore	the	jobs	of	those	workers	in	the	
affected	small	businesses	because	of	the	ongoing	health	concerns.	Government-
ordered	re-openings	will	have	little	impact	on	local	employment,	because	people	
will	still	avoid	those	same	businesses.	
	
	
	
Thus,	the	speed	and	scale	of	economic	recovery	will	be	proportional	to	the	speed	
and	scale	of	modifying	workplaces	to	operate	safely	in	the	presence	of	the	virus.	
Without	that,	workers	will	be	reluctant	to	return	to,	and	customers	will	continue	to	
avoid,	previously	perfectly	viable	businesses.	To	the	extent	that	public	policy	can	
play	a	supportive	role	in	the	economy,	this	problem	strikes	me	as	a	perfect	place	for	
action.	
	
One	could	easily	design,	for	example,	a	tax	credit	equal	to	a	fraction	of	the	cost	of	
protecting	employees	and	reconfiguring	workplaces.	The	former	would	consist	of	
employee	COVID-19	testing,	deep	cleaning	and	disinfectants,	and	personal	
protection	equipment	for	employees.	The	latter	would	include	expenses	for	
reconfiguring	places	regularly	used	by	customers	or	employees	to	bring	them	up	to	
standards.	The	spending	would	have	to	occur	in	calendar	year	2020	(and	after	the	
declaration	of	an	emergency	on	March	13).	
	
Since	many	firms	will	have	no	income	tax	liability	in	2020,	it	makes	sense	for	this	
policy	to	be	a	credit	against	payroll	taxes	and	refundable.	Since	most	employers	
remit	their	payroll	taxes	frequently,	this	could	be	implemented	by	simply	reducing	
the	amount	of	payroll	taxes	sent	in,	which	would	give	the	firms	much-needed	cash	
flow	to	do	the	renovations.	Finally,	one	could	put	a	limit	on	the	total	amount	of	the	
credit,	either	in	absolute	terms	or	per	employee.	
	
This	is	one	example	of	focusing	on	the	supply-side	of	the	economy	and	using	policy	
to	offset	an	expensive	shock	imposed	by	the	pandemic.	A	second	supply-side	focus	
should	be	continued	assistance	to	small	businesses	–	either	existing	survivors	or	
new	entrants	replacing	those	that	have	folded	–	who	will	be	the	key	employers	as	
the	economy	seeks	to	regain	full	employment.		
	
The	final	example	is	the	future	of	the	$600	per	week	federal	supplement	to	state	
unemployment	insurance	benefits.	This	supplement	made	perfect	sense	when	the	
objective	was	to	make	sure	people	quarantined	and	did	not	spread	the	coronavirus	
by	going	to	work.	In	short,	the	$600	was	designed	to	be	lucrative	enough	to	be	
better	than	working.	
	
That	is	now	a	real	problem	as	the	policy	objective	shifts	to	encouraging	more	
economic	activity.	More	important,	it	is	not	a	small	problem.	Research	by	the	
America	Action	Forum’s	Isabel	Soto	indicates	that	up	to	63	percent	of	the	nation’s	
workers	would	make	more	on	the	maximum	unemployment	benefit	than	their	pay	
at	the	previous	job.	Moreover,	the	fraction	differs	by	state	and	could	be	as	high	as	75	
percent.	The	bonus	speaks	highly	of	the	taxpayers’	generosity,	but	it	flunks	any	test	
of	economic	logic.	
	
This	problem	extends	beyond	the	private	sector.	The	latest	from	Soto	indicates	that	
“At	least	62	percent	of	all	state	and	local	[government]	workers	could	make	more	on	
the	enhanced	unemployment	benefit	of	$600	a	week	than	at	work.”	In	short,	
	
	
Congress	could	fill	the	coffers	of	states	and	localities,	jobs	would	still	exist	at	full	pay,	
and	nearly	two-thirds	of	workers	would	be	financially	better	off	on	unemployment	
insurance.		
	
To	summarize,	the	strategy	of	using	trillions	of	dollars	to	keep	the	economy	in	
suspended	animation	and	outwait	the	coronavirus	is	over.	A	traditional	playbook	of	
Keynesian	stimulus	–	checks	to	low-income	households	and	grants	to	states	and	
localities	–	does	not	match	the	dynamics	of	the	economic	downturn.	Instead,	we	
need	an	aggressive	strategy	that	is	targeted	at	the	problems	facing	the	economy.		
	
Automatic	Stabilizers	
	
Automatic	stabilizers	are	provisions	in	law	that	generate	greater	aggregate	demand	
as	the	economy	slows	or	declines.	For	example,	a	progressive	tax	system	acts	as	an	
automatic	stabilizer	because	as	incomes	fall	households	move	into	lower	tax	
brackets	and	have	a	greater	fraction	of	their	earnings	available	to	spend.	Similarly,	
the	UI	system	serves	as	an	automatic	stabilizer	by	providing	income	to	the	
unemployed.		
	
Obviously,	the	United	States	already	has	in	place	automatic	stabilizers.	There	has	
been	interest,	evidenced	by	this	hearing,	in	augmenting	the	system	of	automatic	
stabilizers.	For	example,	in	a	recent	Wall	Street	Journal	opinion	piece,	former	
Council	of	Economic	Advisers	Chairman	Jason	Furman	argued,	“Congress	should	
pass	a	law	immediately	that	would	automatically	trigger	stimulus	if	the	labor	
market	deteriorates,	with	unemployment	rising	rapidly.	The	package	should	include	
not	only	tax	cuts	but	also	relief	for	states,	as	well	as	extra	help	for	people	most	hurt	
by	recessions.	The	legislation	should	be	permanent,	the	measures	lasting	as	long	as	
needed	in	the	next	downturn	and	set	to	trigger	in	future	ones	as	well.”	
	
At	an	abstract	level,	the	argument	is	appealing.	But	I	have	reservations	about	the	
idea	at	this	juncture.	First,	the	United	States	already	has	automatic	stabilizers	(as	
noted	above)	and	there	has	been	no	compelling	case	made	that	they	are	somehow	
insufficient.	Indeed,	“how	big”	is	a	difficult	question	to	answer.	It	is	far	from	obvious	
(to	me	at	least)	how	to	appropriately	scale	the	kinds	of	provisions	that	are	
suggested.	
	
The	alternative	to	automatic	stabilizers	is	discretionary	actions	by	Congress	in	the	
event	of	a	downturn.	Congress	can	(and	has)	cut	taxes,	enhanced	unemployment	
insurance,	provided	assistance	to	states,	augmented	the	Supplemental	Nutrition	
Assistance	Program	(SNAP),	and	so	on.	
	
Thinking	about	the	alternatives	raises	two	additional	concerns.	First,	from	a	
budgetary	perspective,	automatic	stabilizers	are	mandatory	spending,	while	
discretionary	policy	is	(literally)	discretionary	spending.	Other	things	being	equal,	it	
would	be	unwise	to	create	additional	mandatory	spending	programs	–	mandatory	
spending	is	the	long-run	budget	problem.		
	
The	second	additional	concern	is	that	it	seems	most	likely	that	the	outcome	will	be	
both	automatic	and	discretionary	responses.	I	consider	it	extremely	unlikely	that	
faced	with	a	significant	downturn,	Congress	and	the	administration	will	choose	to	
do	nothing	and	explain	to	the	American	people	that	their	predecessors	had	taken	
care	of	this	problem.	Instead,	regardless	of	the	robustness	of	the	automatic	
stabilizers	that	are	in	place,	Congress	and	the	administration	will	enact	further	
discretionary	policies.	The	result	will	be	budgetary	excess	and	unsound	fiscal	policy.	
Thank	you	and	I	look	forward	to	your	questions.	"

Instead of looking to new ways for government 
to spend taxpayers’ money and drive future 
generations  deeper  into  debt  or  fiscal 
catastrophe, policymakers should look to ways 
to help workers and families be able to achieve 
their  own  desires  and  potential—whatever 
those may be.  
 
Some of the key components of certainty and 
confidence are having ample opportunities to 
work, earn a living, and save for the future. 
Policymakers  can  reduce  barriers  to 
employment  in  the  short  and  long  term  by 
allowing safe reopenings of society, providing 
limiting liability for workers and businesses 
that  follow  CDC  guidance,  respecting 
individuals’  right  to  work,  repealing  wage 
restrictions  that  reduce  jobs,  and  ending 
restrictions  that  limit  workplace  flexibility. 
Moreover, removing red tape and reducing the 
most harmful taxes (such as on investment) 
will lead to increased productivity and income 
gains.  
 
These are the types of policies that led to a 50-
year record low-unemployment rate and strong 
income growth with the largest gains for the 
lowest-income  earners  prior  to  COVID-19. 
Along with a serious commitment to reducing 
the federal government’s spending and debt, 
these are the same types of policies that will 
help  reduce  uncertainty,  restore  confidence, 
and help Americans flourish.

“Reducing Uncertainty and Restoring Confidence  
During the Coronavirus Recession” 
  
Prepared Remarks, July 30, 2020 
 
Chairman Lee, our distinguished committee members and witnesses, welcome 
everyone. 
 
Our country faces two crises – a virus that already has killed 154,000 Americans…. 
 
…. and the worst economy since the Great Depression. 
 
Our tragic failure to contain the coronavirus led directly to the economic meltdown. 
 
The President’s ill-advised push to “liberate the states” and abandon strict social 
distancing measures has led to an explosion of new cases and deaths…. 
 
… and likely will prolong the deep economic downturn. 
 
The President’s economic policy is his coronavirus policy – which tragically, is first 
to put his head in the sand, then throw his hands in the air, then blame others. 
 
This is the number one reason there are more than 65,000 new cases a day, and why 
more than 30 million Americans are on unemployment. 
 
We have had the privilege of talking to many prominent economists, and they all tell 
us the same thing. 
 
To restore the economy, we must first get the coronavirus under control.  
 
But it’s essential not only to contain the virus – we must also give Americans a high 
degree of confidence that the virus is contained. 
 
They must know that they are safe before they will go back to work, before they will 
return to stores.

JEC Hearing on Reducing Uncertainty and Restoring Confidence – Opening Remarks 
 
As Fed Chairman Powell said, [quote] “Until the public is confident that the disease 
is contained, a full recovery is unlikely.”1 
 
The best that we in Congress can do is give Americans confidence that we will help 
them stay afloat while the virus rages. 
 
 
The economic damage is staggering. 
 
•  For 19 straight weeks, more than one million Americans have filed new 
unemployment insurance claims.  
•  We’ve lost a net 15 million jobs since February. 
•  And the unemployment rate is the highest it’s been in over 80 years.  
The labor market recovery has stalled.  
 
According to the Census’s Household Pulse Survey, the number of employed 
Americans fell by 4 million in a recent week – the fourth straight week the number 
of Americans with a job has declined. 
 
CBO estimates that the unemployment rate will remain above 10 percent for the rest 
of this year. 
 
As a result, nearly one in five American households could not make any portion of 
their rent or mortgage payments on time in July.  
 
Millions stand in line at food banks. 
 
Over 40% of Americans report serious anxiety or stress. 
 
In March, Congress passed emergency, enhanced unemployment benefits to help 
Americans survive the coronavirus recession, enough to live on.   
 
More than 25 million Americans receive those benefits.  
 
The Democratic House voted two months ago to extend them. 
 
But Mitch McConnell refused even to consider the Heroes Act – knowing that 
millions of Americans who rely on those benefits live in uncertainty and fear. 
Page 2 
 
JEC Hearing on Reducing Uncertainty and Restoring Confidence – Opening Remarks 
 
 
  
Tomorrow, thanks to McConnell, those unemployment benefits expire.  
 
This will have ripple effects throughout the economy. Without benefits, jobless 
workers will reduce spending, miss rent payments, fall behind on mortgage payments 
and even face eviction or foreclosure. More businesses will be forced to close. 
 
 
EPI estimates that reducing the weekly federal benefit from $600 to $200, as 
Republicans have proposed, would reduce GDP by 2.5 percent and cost the economy 
3.4 million jobs over the next year.  That is more the entire economy grew in 2019! 
 
But there is a simple solution to this damaging brinksmanship – take politics out of 
it. 
Our Democratic witnesses Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein – as well as other  
top economists – support the use of “automatic stabilizers” that tie federal spending 
to economic conditions.  
They quickly provide help when the economy heads into recession. 
If unemployment is elevated, unemployment insurance along with SNAP, Medicaid 
and other key supports should continue until the economy recovers. 
We shouldn’t have to vote 13 times – as during the Great Recession – to extend 
unemployment benefits. 
This should be automatic! 
It should continue as only long as it’s needed – and no longer.  
I have always believed this approach would appeal to fiscal conservatives. 
Yesterday, I introduced legislation, the Worker Relief and Security Act, to tie 
enhanced emergency unemployment benefits to the unemployment rate in each state. 
If the bill were to become law, we wouldn’t be witnessing this damaging political 
showdown.  
 
None of us can predict how long the recession will last. So, let’s not try to guess. 
Page 3 
 
JEC Hearing on Reducing Uncertainty and Restoring Confidence – Opening Remarks 
 
I believe we will reach an agreement to extend enhanced unemployment benefits at 
some level.   This is a moral imperative. 
 
I will fight to make sure that it’s enough for unemployed Americans to weather the 
recession.  
 
And I will continue to fight to make sure that in the future such help is automatic. 
 
I will fight to help give Americans confidence that the federal government will 
provide adequate help when it’s most needed. 
 
I look forward to the testimony from our witnesses.

Opening Statement  
JEC Hearing on “Reducing Uncertainty and Restoring Confidence 
during the Coronavirus Recession” 
July 30th, 2020, 3:00pm 
 
Thank you, Vice Chair Beyer, and thank you for presiding for the first time as Vice Chair 
over this very timely hearing. 
The pandemic and the havoc it wreaked on American lives and the economy is unlike 
anything in recent memory. In response, Congress took unprecedented action that, 
along with Federal Reserve initiatives, helped stabilize the economy.  
Beyond the legislative changes that we enacted, existing features of the tax code and 
traditional safety net programs like unemployment insurance are helping families that 
lose income and jobs as the pandemic ravages our communities. Known as “automatic 
stabilizers,” these policy provisions operate simultaneously with other actions taken by 
state and local governments and Congress. 
But it concerns me that many want to extend automatic stabilizers, as that would 
override the deliberation that Americans expect of their elected representatives and 
could hinder the economic recovery. 
Mandating more spending in the form of expanded automatic stabilizers—ones that turn 
on and off based on macroeconomic conditions—contributes to one of the main 
problems of federal spending: that it is overly automated, causing legislators to actively 
manage less and less of the budget as time goes on. 
Reducing legislative discretion increases costs, reduces our ability to control the 
national debt, and diminishes policymakers’ ability to tailor responses to the specifics of 
a future crisis.  
1 
 
The extraordinary measures we enacted initially were warranted but are not strategies 
we should continue to pursue now. They are unsustainable over the indefinite course of 
the pandemic. Today we must pivot to helping our communities reopen safely. 
Our focus going forward should be on policies that pave the way for American recovery 
and allow businesses to adapt and reopen as safely and quickly as possible, while 
giving their employees and the customers they serve confidence in the procedures that 
are in place.  
There are multiple actions Congress could take to strengthen the U.S. economy and 
hasten the recovery. We should examine and remove the regulations currently in place 
that are holding back businesses and workers from responding more dynamically to 
changing economic conditions, and we should consider how Congress can encourage 
Americans to save more so they can be better prepared for future crises. 
Our efforts should include leveraging charitable giving by reforming its inequitable 
treatment in the tax code. This reform could bolster our COVID-19 response, as we 
discussed in our last hearing.  
Our efforts should also include sun-setting all federal regulations that were waived 
during the pandemic. In a letter to the recently confirmed Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, Russell Vought, several of my Senate colleagues and I asked 
that these waived regulations go through the regulatory review process. This process 
would determine whether these regulations should be maintained, modified, or 
repealed. We noted that the absence of the waived regulations improved COVID-19 
response efforts, and allowed doctors to practice medicine across state lines and 
provide telehealth services for Medicare patients.  
Now also seems like a particularly good time to pass the Working Families Flexibility 
Act, which would allow more employers to offer workers a choice between overtime pay 
and paid time off. This could help workers take time off if they become ill or need to care 
2 
 
for loved ones, while also giving employers another tool to help weather the disruptive 
effects of the pandemic on payrolls and schedules.  
Whatever actions we take, we must not lose faith in our ability as a deliberative body to 
represent our constituents and to consider and create policy solutions tailored to the 
crises our country faces. And we must remember that policies should support the 
resiliency of the American people in the face of adversity rather than make them more 
dependent upon government. 
Thank you again, Vice Chair Beyer, for calling this important hearing, and thanks to the 
witnesses for being here today. I look forward to your testimony and a worthwhile 
discussion.

Testimony to the Joint Economic Committee – “Supporting Charitable Giving During the COVID-19 Crisis” 
Submitted by U.S Senator James Lankford 
 
Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Beyer, members of the Committee – I want to thank you for holding this 
critically important hearing on ways we can boost charitable giving during the middle of the COVID-19 
pandemic.  This is an incredibly challenging time for individuals and families all across our nation, and 
supporting members of our non-profit community will be essential to a speedy and full recovery.   
 
Our churches, charities, and other non-profits form a major pillar in each of our communities.  They help 
support our neighbors in need, and lend a helping hand to those who are struggling.  They provide a vital 
access point to so many, whether it be a meal at your local soup kitchen, groceries and supplies from a 
city food bank, or a warm coat at a Main Street Goodwill.  Housing/shelter, pro bono health care services, 
job skills training…you name it.  Our non-profits deliver an almost immeasurable range of services, and 
meet the needs of our nation’s most vulnerable every single day.  It’s this quiet dedication and steadfast 
commitment to serving our neighbors and families in need that weaves our safety net together.  The 
safety net protects lives and livelihoods, and works to prevent our struggling neighbors from slipping 
through the cracks of society, while preserving human dignity and worth.   
 
Many of us have worked on the issue of charitable giving for a long time.  We’ve examined various ways 
to boost giving through the tax code, and we’ve tried to remove regulatory burdens where we find them 
that prevent our churches and charities from fulfilling their missions.   
 
For years, many of our non-profits have struggled to meet the needs of their neighbors, and 
unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the situation further.  With millions having 
lost their jobs and livelihoods over the past weeks and months, we’ve heard from thousands of non-
profits who have been hit exceptionally hard by the dip in giving and fundraising.  In many cases, they’ve 
been unable to make their payrolls and make payments on their fixed monthly costs.  Initiatives like the 
Paycheck Protection Program were helpful, but we can do more.   
 
We must find creative ways to incentivize those who have the heart and means to give, to give.  Our 
country’s non-profits need their support now more than ever. 
 
That’s why I’ve been working with five of my colleagues in the Senate – including you Mr. Chairman – on 
a bipartisan way to boost giving through the tax code.  As most folks watching this hearing know, the 
CARES Act included a new $300 above-the-line deduction that taxpayers can claim for 2020 in addition to 
taking the standard deduction.  Although I advocated for a significantly higher amount – given the 
financial pressures COVID has placed on our non-profits – it was a welcome policy addition, and I 
appreciated its inclusion.  However, we must go bigger if we are going to match the size of the need 
COVID has brought upon us.  If we don’t, we risk creating a massive void in our social safety net, meaning 
our most vulnerable will have critical needs unmet during one of the most painful times in our nation’s 
history.  The beauty and importance of what our churches and charities bring to communities is 
underscored by the fact that they are not of the federal or state government, and thus they are not 
propped up by taxpayer dollars.  Rather, they are funded by the kindness and generosity of our fellow 
citizens.   
 
The approach we’re offering is simple – let’s build on the current $300 deduction for cash gifts included in 
CARES, and increase the limit to one-third of the standard deduction (that’s $4000 for individuals or 
     
 
$8000 for married filers).  Let’s also make it applicable to the 2019 tax year as well, so that those who 
gave last year can go back and amend their 2019 returns to also take advantage.  That was an idea from 
my good friend and fellow panelist, Senator Shaheen, and one that we’ve worked to include in the 
updated version.   
 
This is a straightforward way to incentivize giving for taxpayers who take the standard deduction.  This 
would really help our middle to low income taxpayers who want to give.  This policy rewards that 
generosity which ultimately benefits our churches and charities who turn those gifts into met needs.   
 
The challenge is clear – we need to support our non-profits by boosting giving.  This is a great way to do 
that, and one that has strong bipartisan support here in Congress.  Moreover, we have overwhelming 
support in the non-profit community.  We had over 6000 non-profits of all sizes and missions that 
became a part of our support coalition during the debate on CARES, and they continue to help us build 
momentum.   
 
I want to give a special thanks to some of my colleagues who have been real leaders in continuing to push 
this forward – Senators Shaheen, Coons, Scott, Klobuchar, and certainly Chairman Lee.  I’d also like to 
thank our House-side partner, Congressmen Walker, for his leadership across the Capitol.  We’ve worked 
on this issue together since 2017, and the non-profit sector has no better advocate in the House. 
 
I sincerely thank the Committee for holding this important hearing, and for allowing me the opportunity 
to speak.  I look forward to working with each of you to further enact policies that will lift up our nation’s 
non-profits at a time when they are needed more than ever.   
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Testimony of Senator Jeanne Shaheen 
Joint Economic Committee 
Hearing on Supporting Charitable Giving During the COVID-19 Crisis 
June 9, 2020 
 
Chairman Lee, Vice Chairman Beyer, thank you for the opportunity to share a few thoughts with 
you today on this very important subject. 
 
New Hampshire has a historically dynamic and robust nonprofit community, and charitable 
organizations provide critical services throughout the Granite State. 
 
From food banks to homeless shelters, arts organizations and faith-based groups, these entities 
are part of the fabric of our society in New Hampshire and around the country. 
 
Particularly in New Hampshire, nonprofit organizations form part of our social safety net to 
protect and support our citizens and communities. For example: 
 
  Area Agencies in New Hampshire provide programs for people with developmental 
disabilities and their families. 
  The New Hampshire Coalition against Domestic and Sexual Violence, and the state's 13 
crisis centers, provide critical services for survivors of domestic and sexual violence. 
  And New Horizons helps homeless individuals and families reach beyond the cycle of 
homelessness to lead healthy and successful lives. 
 
I have had multiple calls with these and other nonprofit groups in my state to hear about the 
important work they are doing right now to help lessen the impact of this pandemic. 
 
However, many organizations in New Hampshire and around the country are now struggling to 
fundraise due to their inability to conduct in-person events, as well as the economic strain so 
many families are experiencing. 
 
According to a recent pulse survey conducted by the New Hampshire Center for Nonprofits, 92 
percent of responding nonprofits have reported a drop in revenue by an average of 34 percent, 
while 45 percent of respondents have instituted layoffs. 
 
At the same time, according to the same survey, 38 percent of organizations, including 45 
percent of human service organizations reported an increase in demand for their services, and 44 
percent of all respondents have increased some operations to meet this surge in demand. 
 
Now more than ever, we should be doing everything we can to support these organizations, and 
providing an incentive through the tax code is a simple way for Congress to stand side-by-side 
with our nonprofits and charitable organizations and faith-based groups during this challenging 
time. 
 
I’m very pleased to be working with a bipartisan group of Senators, including Chairman Lee and 
Senator Lankford, as well as others, to design a tax incentive that would allow a taxpayer to 
1 
 
claim an above-the-line deduction equal to up to 1/3 of the standard deduction, or $8,000 for a 
married couple filing jointly, for charitable contributions made in tax year 2020. 
 
In addition, this legislation would include my proposal to allow a deduction for charitable 
contributions made before the new tax filing deadline of July 15, 2020 to be “carried back” to tax 
year 2019, either through a current filing or, for those who have already filed their 2019 returns, 
through an amended return. 
 
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for inviting me to discuss the legislation and I appreciate your 
partnership as we work to get this bill across the threshold. As we all know, Congress must act 
now because the need is great and the challenges that nonprofit and charitable organizations are 
working to address are so acute.

JEC Committee Testimony (Final Version: 6/5/2020 9:59 AM)  Bill Crim 
    President and CEO 
    United Way of Salt Lake 
 
 
Chairman Lee, Vice Chairman Beyer, Members of the Committee,  
I deeply appreciate the opportunity to come before the committee to talk about United 
Way of Salt Lake’s work, our response to the COVID-19 crisis and the role tax policy plays in 
driving private giving. 
United Way of Salt Lake builds cross-sector partnerships that work to solve our 
community’s most complex social and economic problems. Within these partnerships we hold 
ourselves accountable to results that no single organization – or sector – can achieve alone. 
Together with thousands of individual donors and volunteers – and with hundreds of private, 
public, and social sector partners, we are working to make sure that every child in our 
community has the opportunity to succeed in school and in life. We do this by improving and 
expanding early learning opportunities, strengthening literacy and math skills, and supporting 
high school graduation and completion from post-secondary education. Through 2-1-1 and our 
partnerships focused on the social determinants of health, we are working to improve health 
outcomes by changing the ways health systems interact with community-based organizations 
and improving the ways that economically vulnerable Utahns connect to the more than 10,000 
services available in the charitable and public sectors in Utah. 
Our commitment to create lasting change and help all kids and families succeed, 
regardless of their circumstances, holds especially true during this time.  As we continue to 
address the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as we are all called to 
address the urgent need for racial justice in our country, we know that the role of nonprofits, 
and of charitable giving, is critical. 
Over the past three months, hundreds of individual Utahns have generously risen to the 
challenge of supporting our community. In addition, key business partners like Goldman Sachs, 
Mark Miller, Zions Bank and Savage have contributed to our work. This generosity has allowed 
us to respond to dramatic increases in contacts through 2-1-1, to provide critical support to 
dozens of community partners meeting essential basic needs, and to develop a comprehensive

initiative to address the dramatic learning loss experienced by so many students over the past 
three months.   
I am proud to be talking to you today from Utah, the most charitable state in the United 
States – which is the most charitable country in the world. 
Reasons for giving are highly personal – but I can assure you from firsthand experience 
that people give to charities for altruistic reasons.  Sometimes this selfless concern for others is 
driven by faith or simply a desire to give back to the community in which they live.  Often, and 
in our case, it is because people believe that by working together we can solve society’s most 
complex problems. 
But tax policy does influence people’s behavior, from business investment decisions to 
buying a home.  This doesn’t mean every person is influenced by tax policy, but large numbers 
of people are.   
Charitable giving is the most discretionary financial decision someone can make.  Good 
tax policy might be the nudge that someone needs to make their first donation.  Or it may 
prompt a long-time donor to give a little more. 
Consider, for example, a person who gives $500 per year to charities.  If they paid a 20% 
tax rate, that means they are paying $100 in taxes on that money they are giving away.  Setting 
aside the fundamental unfairness of taxing income that’s being donated to help others, those 
taxes may prompt a smaller donation from some people who aren’t in a position to give any 
more.   
Conversely, if Congress were to relieve tens of millions of Americans from taxes on 
income they donate, it’s not hard to imagine the positive impact on charitable giving. 
2 
 
JEC Committee Testimony (Final Version: 6/5/2020 9:59 AM)  Bill Crim 
    President and CEO 
    United Way of Salt Lake 
 
 
I am not an economist or tax policy expert, but studies have consistently found that 
good tax policy will drive more giving, that includes increased giving by people who make small 
donations. 
United Ways, basic needs charities, faith-based charities, and disaster relief charities 
rely heavily on small donations from large numbers of people.  We raise about $15 million per 
year in Salt Lake City.  But our average individual donation is $229 per year.  Those small 
donations add up.  Nationally, United Ways raise over $1 billion per year from small donors 
who give on average $155 per year.  (Note our donor-base is diverse and we raise several billion 
more from corporate partners and large donors.) 
Of course, in my view the ideal federal tax policy would be to permanently relieve all 
taxpayers from paying taxes on income they donate to charity.  That could happen through an 
above the line exclusion or a non-itemizer charitable deduction combined with the existing 
deduction. Bills by Congressman Danny Davis (D-IL) or Congressmen Chris Smith (R-NJ) and 
Henry Cuellar (D-TX) would do that.   
We understand that that may not be viable at this moment in time.  But a temporary 
non-itemizer deduction could be instrumental in helping charities help our communities and 
those impacted by crises facing our country. 
We understand Chairman Lee, Senator Klobuchar, and others are supporting a 
temporary deduction modeled after Senator Lankford’s and Congressman Mark Walker’s 
legislation.  We think that legislation would provide a much needed infusion of donations 
directly to the charities that are leading the COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.  The 
recovery efforts by charities will go well beyond 2020, so the longer this legislation is in effect, 
the better it will help us support our communities and those who have been affected by COVID-
19.

As I close, I want to note that several Members of this Committee have supported and 
personally donated to their United Way (in at least one case for decades) and others have 
played significant roles in raising donations for their local United Ways.  On behalf of United 
Way, I want to extend our deepest thanks to each of you. 
Mr. Chairman, I’m happy to answer any questions.

CHARITABLE GIVING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
WRITTEN TESTIMONY 
Una Osili, Ph.D. 
Joint Economic Committee 
Chairman  Lee,  Vice Chair  Beyer,  and  other  distinguished  members  of  the  Joint  Economic 
Committee.  
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am the Associate Dean for Research and 
International Programs at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy- the world's 
first School dedicated to the study and teaching of philanthropy. The School is in the vanguard of 
philanthropy education and research. I am also a Professor of Economics and Philanthropic 
Studies. 
The School's research initiatives have tracked crisis and disaster giving since September 11, 2001. 
My written testimony will focus on addressing three crucial questions: 1) What are the current 
trends in charitable giving during the COVID-19 pandemic 2) How should these trends be 
interpreted in light of  overall charitable giving patterns? 3) What are the policies that can 
strengthen charitable giving by American households now and in the future?  
CHARITABLE GIVING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
For many American households, philanthropy is a core value.  
Through good times, and during times of crisis and upheaval, American philanthropy – which 
includes  donors  at  all  income  levels,  and  all  racial  and  ethnic  backgrounds  –  has  worked 
collaboratively to fill gaps where governments or markets face limitations and provide capital for 
innovation, and to meet basic needs.  
Philanthropy defined ""as voluntary action for the public good"" is a central way for Americans to 
contribute to civic and social life and the vitality and strength of their communities.  The 
philanthropic sector role is evident in short-term emergencies as well as in Americans’ long-term 
commitment  to  religious  congregations,  food  pantries,  homeless  shelters,  neighborhood 
associations, to the arts, and to educational programs. 
In 2018, Americans donated about $427.71 billion to charitable organizations [1], of which about 
68 percent came from living individuals.  
The COVID-19 pandemic has induced twin crises in communities across the U.S. Americans of 
all  backgrounds  are  grappling  with  unprecedented  health  and  economic  shocks.  Moreover, 
African-American and Latino populations have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-
19 pandemic, exposing deep racial and structural inequities [2]. 
Four aspects of the philanthropic response to the COVID-19 pandemic merit close attention. 
First, we have witnessed tremendous generosity during the COVID-19 pandemic by American 
households  of  all  backgrounds,  not  only  the  immediate  and  generous  monetary  support  to 
charitable organizations, but also ""mutual aid"" to neighbors, friends, and community members. To 
date, U.S. foundations and corporations have contributed over $11 billion to the novel coronavirus 
response, based on Candid's estimates [3]. 
Research can provide critical insights for donor patterns and better understand what we might be 
in store so we can strengthen services and support recovery efforts ahead. Philanthropy has played 
an important role during and following national and international crises. From 9/11 to the disasters, 
such as Hurricane Harvey in 2017, we have seen Americans of all ages, education, and income 
levels give generously of their money, their goods, their time, and their talent, as well as build 
networks during times of crisis.  
In response to such crises, around 30 percent of U.S. households made a disaster-related donation 
in 2017 and 2018, and the average donation was about $300 [4]. The magnitude of a disaster was 
found in our research to be the top factor encouraging Americans to contribute to disaster aid 
efforts. Many Americans who donated after disasters did so without reducing their giving to other 
charitable causes. Nearly 80 percent of households who donated to disaster-related activities in 
2017 and 2018 did not change their giving to other causes, and 12 percent even increased their 
giving to other causes. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, philanthropy has continued to play a critical role in addressing 
the immediate health impacts while addressing the cascading effects of the crisis.  
For 20 years, the school has tracked gifts of $1 million or more in the United States through the 
Million  Dollar  List.  In  response  to  COVID-19,  there  have  been  a  significant  number  of 
contributions of $1 million or more made by individuals, including many donations by celebrities 
and other wealthy individuals who have not previously donated at the million-dollar level. To date, 
the largest publicly announced donation is a pledge by Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and 
Square, Inc. [5]. 
Initial evidence suggests that large gifts are fueling scientific advances and serving as a catalyst 
for research in new areas in health, and expanding health care capacity. Specifically, philanthropic 
support has played a role in catalyzing innovation in developing health care capacity, diagnostic 
testing and funding vaccine research.  
Second, during the crisis, new forms of philanthropy—such as crowdfunding—have gained 
visibility. The crisis has inspired innovation with the adoption of new fundraising and virtual 
engagement technologies and demonstrating the role of individual donors in meeting community 
challenges. 
Crowdfunding campaigns, typically driven by small donations, have expanded in their reach and 
impact. There are nearly 200 crowdfunding campaigns in the United States on GoFundMe.com 
that have each raised over $100,000. The largest – America's Food Fund – has raised over $26 
million and focuses on addressing food insecurity during the pandemic.  
Another significant crowdfunding campaign launched by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) 
Foundation on Charidy.com has raised nearly $50 million. 
Numerous national and global fundraising campaigns have taken place since the beginning of the 
pandemic. One of the largest, One World: Together at Home, which took place on April 18, raised 
nearly $128 million [6], while over $503 million was donated online during #GivingTuesdayNow 
on May 5 [7]. 
Third, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also seen philanthropy as a unique 
collaborator, convener, and facilitator of collective action in local communities.  
A unique initiative led by Dr. Laurie Paarlberg, Endowed Chair in Community Philanthropy at the 
Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, is tracking philanthropy's response at the local level. 
As of May 15, her Mapping Community Philanthropic Response to COVID-19 project estimates 
that community funds in cities and towns across America have raised more than $634 million and 
distributed at least $376 million1 to financially vulnerable individuals and nonprofits. As of May 
15, the research team had identified 1020 organizations supporting COVID-19 funds, with 244 
funds jointly supported by United Way or community foundation. Many of these funds have 
worked to address the critical needs created by the pandemic –including food insecurity, mental 
health, and emergency financial assistance. 
Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed harsh social and economic disparities. Private 
funders and nonprofits are working to address the needs of the most vulnerable who are most 
impacted by the pandemic's economic fallout. 
In Michigan, a collaboration of philanthropic organizations (including the Kellogg Foundation) 
rapidly joined forces to supply computer tablets with high-speed internet connectivity to Detroit 
Public School students [8]. The $23 million fund, called Connected Futures, addresses the digital 
divide for K-12 students. A national fund, the Coronavirus Care Fund (CCF), provides emergency 
assistance for qualifying domestic workers who are facing hardship, and over 100,000 people 
around the country have contributed to the fund [9]. Another national fund, the Families and 
Workers Fund focuses on workers and families who have been affected by job loss and school 
shutdowns [10]. 
The initial philanthropic response to Covid-19 is unprecedented in its speed, size, and scope -- and 
many local food banks and human service charities and nonprofits of all sizes have risen to the 
challenge.  
Not all communities have a sustained capacity to raise much-needed funds and respond to local 
needs. However, the economic and social ripple effects of the pandemic are still unfolding. The 
need for private philanthropy is rising, with many more people and communities needing services 
and support when the ability of some donors to give is challenged.  
                                                 
1 Both numbers are an estimate and under report the magnitude of community philanthropy as only 60% of funds are 
currently publicly reporting resource flows. 
OVERALL TRENDS IN CHARITABLE GIVING 
Research has long-established that charitable giving is linked with national and regional economic 
trends. Several factors influence how much Americans donate, including financial and economic 
conditions.  
Before the Great Recession, the fraction of Americans who gave to charitable causes was stable at 
about two-thirds of the population. In 2016 (the most recent year with available data), around 53 
percent of American households donated [11]. In general, donation participation and amounts 
donated increase with education, wealth, and income [12-14]. 
The Philanthropy Panel Study [15], a module of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics [16], has 
tracked the share of American households who donate to charity since 2000. Between 2000 and 
2008, giving remained steady (66.2 percent donated in 2000 and 65.4 donated in 2008). The 
Great Recession (December 2007–June 2009) [17], in particular, exposed how vulnerable 
household giving is to economic downturns. At the same time, components of 21st-century life 
such as globalization, demographic shifts, decreasing congregational affiliation and attendance, 
and increasing use of technology continue to alter and reshape future giving patterns.  
In 2016, the average American donor contributed $2,763, or about 3.7 percent of income [11]. 
Participation rates and giving levels among individuals with high education, wealth, and income 
have generally held steady or increased [11]. However, among low and middle-income Americans, 
and Americans with less than a high school education declines in participation rates in charitable 
giving are evident [11; 18] For now, this trend of ""dollars up, donors down"" has allowed overall 
giving in the United States to continue to increase in most years [1]. 
Today, low- and middle- income households represent a smaller share of America's individual 
giving landscape with implications for the strength and vibrancy of civil society. 
TAX POLICY AND CHARITABLE GIVING 
Beyond the impact of financial and economic conditions, one important aspect of the giving 
landscape  is  the  potential  tax  benefit  that  U.S.  households  receive  from  their  charitable 
contributions. Tax policy can promote the growth of philanthropy and the development of a 
thriving nonprofit sector.  
The charitable deduction is one of the oldest tenets of the U.S. tax code, dating to 1917. It 
effectively reduces the cost contributing to qualified nonprofit organizations by an amount that 
depends on the donor's marginal tax rate, subject to specific annual limits. It affirms the value our 
society places on voluntary giving and the vital role of philanthropic organizations in meeting 
individual and community needs, and encourages the spirit of generosity that is an integral 
component of American civic life. 
Over time, U.S. federal tax policy has become less progressive. It lowered the tax burden on high-
income households without providing the same incentives for low- and middle-income households 
[19]. This has the potential to reduce giving further by low- and middle-income families.  
When examining the impact of tax policies, policymakers have the opportunity to consider how 
various policy options influence the level of charitable giving dollars, the share of households that 
donate, and the overall impact on tax revenues.  
The Lilly Family School of Philanthropy recently analyzed the impact of various policy options 
that would extend the non-itemizer deduction. Expanding the non-itemizer deduction is estimated 
to increase both participation rates in charitable giving and charitable dollars raised. We projected 
that extending the non-itemizer deduction could increase charitable giving dollars by up to $26.2 
billion (an increase of 7.7 percent), and increase the number of households who donate by up to 
7.3 million households (an increase of 8.2 percent) in 2021 [20]. The policy would reduce Treasury 
revenue by up to $21.6 billion (a decrease of 0.6 percent). Therefore, the plan would bring in up 
to $4.6 billion more in charitable dollars than is lost in Treasury revenue.  
As the nation faces daunting and complex challenges, policy debates have increasingly focused on 
strengthening the incentives for charitable giving.  
The importance of public policy that can support charitable giving is critical. To meet the complex 
challenges of expanding community needs triggered by COVID-19, we need to examine how 
individuals and organizations across public, business, and nonprofit sectors can work together 
effectively to address immediate and long-term challenges.  
Expanding tax incentives for lower- and middle-income Americans can be one vital step in 
fostering public involvement in this critical effort. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I would be happy to respond to any questions you 
may have.

Opening Statement 
JEC Hearing on “Supporting Charitable Giving During the 
COVID 19 Crisis” 
June 9, 2020, 2:30pm 
301 Russell Senate Office Building 
 
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for this hearing of 
the Joint Economic Committee. 
 
Over the past few months, following the spread of the novel 
coronavirus, millions of Americans have been robbed of health, 
financial security, the certainty and normalcy of daily life, and 
even of community and connection. 
 
In response, our nation has come together, as we always have – 
through government, of course, and also through the courage and 
compassion of our voluntary civil society. 
 
Nonprofits, churches, and other voluntary institutions have for 
centuries played a uniquely important role in American life – 
helping to provide for others’ basic needs, ensuring the stability of 
community institutions, and supplying goods such as education 
and the arts. 
 
Key to this spirit is charitable giving. Without financial donations, 
these organizations cannot undertake the good works that they do 
– including providing the indirect benefits of personal 
connectedness, reciprocity and trust that are invaluable to 
community thriving. 
 
Page 1 of 5 
Unfortunately, there have been worrisome trends in charitable 
giving over recent years. 
 
As JEC staff research has found, while total American charitable 
giving has increased in most years over the last half century, the 
overall percentage of Americans giving has decreased –from 66 
percent in 2000 to 56 percent in 2014 – with a particularly 
pronounced drop among lower-income Americans. 
 
Additionally, the share of individual giving out of total giving has 
dropped over time, decreasing from 83 percent in 1978 to 68 
percent in 2018.   
 
In other words, giving is now primarily from fewer, wealthier 
people and organizations. 
 
Why does this matter? 
 
First, it denies communities the necessary, positive “spillover” 
effects that flow from individual contributions and widespread 
altruism. 
 
And second, the very causes being supported are likely to change 
as a result of these trends. While higher-income Americans tend 
to give to education and the arts, less affluent Americans tend to 
give towards service and assistance to the poor. In fact, those 
making $100,000 or less are responsible for 49% of all giving to 
this area of vital need.  
 
Page 2 of 5 
One unintended contributor to this trend is the federal tax code’s 
inequitable treatment of charitable giving. As a “below-the-line” 
deduction, only those who itemize – generally, tax filers toward 
the upper end of the income scale – can currently claim the 
charitable deduction. Lower-income families who don’t itemize 
now receive no tax benefit for their charitable contributions. 
 
This is an unintended consequence of the longstanding, 
bipartisan effort to raise the standard deduction, which provides 
tax relief to lower- and middle-income filers. But it’s an inequity 
just the same, and an injustice to working families and the local 
charities who rely on them.  
 
While the CARES Act, passed earlier this year, did add an above-
the-line deduction of $300 for non-itemizers, much more could 
and – I believe – should be done. I called this hearing to talk 
about how – especially in this time of great hardship, when 
charitable giving is so essential – Congress can better address 
this disparity. 
 
In recent weeks, I have been part of a bipartisan working group to 
develop legislation reforming this inequity. I am grateful that two 
other members of the group, Senators Lankford and Shaheen, 
could be here to talk about it today. Especially in the wake of the 
COVID emergency, leveraging charitable giving should be a top 
priority for those of us tasked with reviving our economy.  
 
In the coming months, those of us in the House and Senate are 
going to expend a lot of energy trying to figure out which of the 
federal programs on which we have spent all these trillions of 
Page 3 of 5 
dollars have worked… and which haven’t. It’s going to be a 
complicated, and at times controversial, project for all of us. 
 
With the non-profit sector, however, the vetting work has already 
been done for us. Charitable organizations only exist and attract 
donations to the extent that they are already believed to succeed. 
They can serve as the “tip of the spear” in our national COVID 
response and help chart the course for government-financed relief 
at all levels. 
 
Today’s hearing will focus on just that, and we will hear not only 
from Senators Lankford and Shaheen, but from two additional 
witnesses with valuable perspectives on philanthropy. I look 
forward to hearing the contributions of our panelists and 
colleagues on this important topic. 
 
Before we proceed, let me say a few words about how the 
hearing has been modified from its usual format in light of the 
spread of the coronavirus. The hearing room has been configured 
to maintain the recommended 6-foot social distancing between 
Members and other individuals in the room necessary to operate 
the hearing, which we have kept to a minimum. 
 
A number of Members and witnesses have chosen to use secure 
video teleconference technology, which will allow them to 
participate remotely. For those joining remotely, once you start 
speaking, there will be a slight delay before you are displayed on 
screen. To minimize background noise, we are asking those who 
are using the video conference option to please click the mute 
button until it is their turn to ask questions. 
Page 4 of 5 
 
If there is a technology issue, we will move to the next Member 
until it is resolved. 
 
I would remind all Members and witnesses that the 5-minute timer 
will be used. For those joining us remotely, you will notice a 
screen labeled “Timer” that will show how much time is remaining. 
 
I now recognize Vice Chair Beyer, for opening remarks.

“Supporting Charitable Giving during the Coronavirus Pandemic” 
Prepared Remarks, June 9, 2020 
 
 
Thank you Chairman Lee. Thank you to our witnesses Dr. Osili and Mr. Crim for 
sharing your expertise and perspective with us here today. And thank you Senators 
Shaheen and Lankford for joining the Committee this afternoon.    
   
I think everyone here agrees: charities are one of our nation’s precious resources.  
 
They provide invaluable services and strengthen our communities. Perhaps at no 
time in our history has this important role been so visible as during this global 
pandemic and resulting economic crisis. 
 
I volunteered at a food bank in my district recently—for as long as I was there you 
could not see the end of the line—and they told me that one of their biggest 
challenges is that they are no longer getting the extra food from restaurants because 
restaurants are closed so they are having to turn to their state and local 
governments to fund the food they need to feed all of these people who do not have 
any income. 
 
Throughout this crisis, America’s charities have been front-line responders, 
providing communities that have been critically impacted with access to housing, 
emergency child care for first responders, support for victims of domestic abuse, 
counseling and other critical services. 
Recent challenges 
Unfortunately, at a time when we need nonprofits more than ever and when more 
Americans are turning to them for support, they also are facing serious economic 
challenges.  
 
Nearly three-quarters of charities globally have seen a decline in donations since 
the crisis began – half expect to absorb a hit of 20 percent. 
 
They depend on a diverse set of resources. Foundations, businesses and 
individuals. But individual giving is key – making up nearly 70 percent of 
charitable contributions. 
JEC Hearing on Charitable Contributions – Opening Remarks 
 
Since 2000, the share of households donating to nonprofits has fallen from two-
thirds to 53 percent in 2016. That translates to 20 million fewer households 
donating. 
The effect of the 2017 Republican tax cuts 
Unfortunately, the 2017 Republican tax cuts, the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” made 
things worse. 
 
You are familiar with the broad contours of the story. 
 
The law nearly doubled the standard deduction to $12,000 for single taxpayers and 
for married couples filing separately, and to $24,000 for married couples filing 
jointly. 
It also capped the State and Local Tax deduction – SALT. 
 
As a result, the law dramatically reduced incentives to itemize deductions. And not 
surprisingly, the number of taxpayers who itemize fell precipitously. 
  
In 2017, before the law was enacted, 26 percent of households itemized. 
 
In 2018, after the law kicked in, the share plummeted to only 10 percent – 
substantially less than half of the percentage that had filed the previous year. Less 
than half.  
 
For the nonprofit world – that hurts. Badly. 
 
Fewer itemizers means fewer givers. That result was widely predicted even before 
the law was passed.  
 
So it shouldn’t have been a surprise to anyone that individual donations fell in 
2018. 
 
Despite a strong economy, individual giving fell by more than 3 percent, after 
adjusting for inflation. As a percentage of GDP, charitable contributions by 
individuals declined by 6 percent. 
  Page 2 
JEC Hearing on Charitable Contributions – Opening Remarks 
The pandemic makes things worse 
Now, with the current crisis, contributions are likely falling faster as charities 
confront both fewer donations and canceled fundraising events. 
 
This means less money will be available and spent on the necessary services these 
organizations provide to our communities. 
 
Already, 60 percent of charities have reduced services. A survey of smaller 
nonprofits found that 13 percent had suspended all or most of their operations. 
Macroeconomic effects 
There are serious economic impacts as well. 
 
In 2017, nonprofits employed more than 12 million people in the United States—
more than 10 percent of the private-sector workforce. 
 
But as a result of the pandemic, nearly one-in-six nonprofits around the world were 
forced to furlough employees. One-in-eight have had to lay people off. 
Policy responses 
We all agree that these are serious problems. The question is what to do about it. 
 
We’ll hear today more about proposals to incentivize additional charitable giving 
by expanding access to the charitable deduction beyond the $300 universal 
deduction for this year included in the CARES Act. Expanding the deduction 
further could help offset lost individual contributions resulting from the TCJA. 
 
I favor taking a broad look at a range of options available to bolster the sector. 
 
Supporting charities and the individuals who count on them for critical services 
and jobs requires a comprehensive approach that includes ensuring organizations 
can access the many supports in CARES and other coronavirus relief legislation. 
 
Congress intentionally made PPP loans available to nonprofits and many have been 
able to utilize them to retain employees and sustain operations. 
 
  Page 3 
JEC Hearing on Charitable Contributions – Opening Remarks 
Nonprofits are also benefiting from the Employee Retention Tax Credit in the 
CARES Act. The HEROES Act would increase the tax credit from 50 percent to 
80 percent of qualifying wages and lift the wage cap. 
Beyer Charitable Rollover bill 
Another path is to tap the generosity of our senior citizens. I’ve introduced a bill 
that would incent charitable giving by expanding the IRA Charitable Rollover to 
allow people starting at age 65 to make tax-free IRA rollovers to charities while 
providing a guaranteed income for the senior citizen. 
 
I know Senator Klobuchar has introduced legislation to provide grants that would 
help nonprofits retain employees or hire those who have recently become 
unemployed. 
We need a sense of urgency 
There are lots of smart ways to address these challenges. 
 
What nonprofits need most is an injection of resources to get them through this 
period. And they need it now.  
 
Some in Congress feel no sense of urgency. But I hear every day from people in 
my district, from nonprofits, big and small, that a sense of urgency is exactly 
what’s needed. 
 
Thank you Chairman Lee for focusing attention on what we can do right now to 
support charities and to help them weather this storm. 
 
And again I’d like to thank our witnesses from inside and outside Congress for 
sharing your perspectives today.

Testimony before the Joint Economic Committee 
Kay Hymowitz, William E. Simon Fellow, Manhattan Institute 
February 25, 2020 
 
 
Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Beyer, Distinguished Members of the Committee: thank you 
for this opportunity to testify today. I am the William E. Simon Fellow at the Manhattan 
Institute. Much of my research over the past 23 years has been on the decline of 
marriage, its causes, its impact on children, and its relationship to poverty and inequality. 
Today, I’d like to focus on what is perhaps an underappreciated part of this story, what 
some family scholars call the marriageable men problem. 
 
The mass movement of American women into the workforce that began in the mid 20th 
century launched an extraordinary social revolution whose ripple effects we are still 
trying to fully understand. In 1950, about one in three women were in the labor force.1 
The numbers for prime age women rose dramatically over the following decades peaked 
at 2000 at 76.7%. Today after a moderate reversal during the Great Recession, it’s 
returned to that historical high2.  Even more striking was the shift in the work patterns of 
women with children. In the past, women who worked almost always left the labor force 
when they gave birth. Today working motherhood is the new normal. As of 2017, 71.3% of 
mothers of children under 18 were in the labor force, including 63% of mothers with 
children under 3.3  In January the Labor Department announced that for the last quarter 
of 2019 women were a majority of those in the nonfarm payroll positions,4 something 
that could be said of no other OECD country.5 
 
This revolution has brought countless benefits to women. In order to prepare themselves 
for the workforce, they’ve spent more years pursuing an education. This has given them 
the chance to use the full range of their talents and pursue their individual interests. It’s 
been widely (and accurately) reported that women are now more likely to graduate from 
college than men are;6  as a result over 40% of women in the labor force have a college 
degree compared to only 36.4% of men.7  Women have also poured into graduate 
schools and now earn more Master’s and Ph.D. degrees, than men do.8  Sixty percent of 
doctors under 35 are women9, more than half of law school graduates and associates are 
also women.10 They make up a quarter of the Senate and nearly a quarter of the House.11 
We hear a great deal about the injustice of our gender gap, but research that takes into 
account occupation, number of hours worked, seniority, and time away from the job, 
finds an unexplained gender income gap of only a few percentage points.12  
 
I would be remiss if I failed to acknowledge that there are still obstacles for women. 
There is still that income gap, even if it is far smaller than generally understood. As the 
#metoo movement reminds us on a regular basis, harassment and discrimination are an 
ongoing problem. Women still do more of the childcare in married couple homes; in 
single mother homes, which constitute the vast majority of single parent households, 
they often do all of it. Despite all of these impediments, the opportunities for American 
women to exercise their talents, to be financially independent, to leave an abusive 
marriage, to buy their own homes, and to build wealth are extraordinary and 
unprecedented.  
 
The opportunities for them to find a desirable husband or partner, that is, a man with 
whom they might want to raise children, turn out to be another matter. The problem is 
especially acute for our lower-skilled population. In 1960, more than 90% of adult women 
over 35 had married.  There was little difference between rich and poor women, high 
school drop outs and college grads; all married at similar rates.13 The numbers for all 
groups began to fall over the next decades, but the decline was especially dramatic for 
women with less than a college degree.  As of 2015, 71 percent of college educated 
women were married; that was true for only 56% percent of less educated women, a 
difference of 14 percentage points.14 Surprisingly, the women who did not marry 
continued having children at a similar rate. As a result, nonmarital births in that 
population soared. Today, 54% of moderately educated women and 66 % of those with a 
high school diploma or less are unmarried mothers.15 The large majority of their children 
will live apart from their fathers for much of their childhood. 
 
The most common explanation for the decline of marriage and mother-father families at 
the lower end of the income ladder is the moribund economic fortunes of low skilled 
men. There is some disagreement about just how much the earnings of these men have 
declined over the past decades16 or whether they have declined at all, 17and I won’t 
elaborate on that debate here.  
 
But there is little question that the economic fortunes of those men relative to women 
have worsened. According to a recent Pew Research study, between 1980 and 2018 the 
overall hourly wage rate rose by 45% for women. For men, the increase was only 14%. 18  
At the higher end of the skills ladder, wage growth was stronger than it was for lower 
skilled jobs. That was the case for both men and women, but the future may well be 
female at that level. Demand for workers with strong analytic, managerial, and social 
skills is growing, as are the wages for those jobs. Women excel in these jobs.  By contrast, 
demand and wages for workers with mechanical skills where men dominate, are either 
stagnant or falling.  With increasing education and labor market experience, “women 
made significant strides in moving out of lower-paying occupations and into higher-
paying occupations from 1980 to 2018, says the Pew report; the same cannot be said for 
their male peers.19   
 
Equally important for understanding the decline of married two parent family is what 
the demographer Nicholas Eberstadt calls “men without work.”20 As of October 2019, 
over 10% of the prime aged male population was entirely MIA from the labor market. 
Thanks to a relatively strong labor market, that represents a slight improvement over 
four years ago, but as Eberstadt notes, it’s still close to Depression-era levels. The large 
majority of these workless men have only a high school degree or less; notably, almost 
none of them are immigrants though the latter are likely to have less well-established 
social networks and more limited English language skills than native born men. Prime 
aged men without work are not going to school, nor are they developing their skills in 
other kinds of training programs. Very few of them report they are interested in finding a 
job.  And, despite an overall increase in male involvement in domestic responsibilities, 
they are not spending “work hours” caring for children. One well publicized 2017 paper 
theorized that improvements in “leisure technology,” namely, video games, played a big 
role in keeping workless young men occupied.21 True or not, workless haven’t found 
another way to make much money; more than a third of them lived below the poverty 
line, compared to 9 percent of prime-age men overall.22   
 
What does all of this have to do with marriage? After all, the traditional family model 
with a male breadwinner and homemaker wife has been in decline for more than five 
decades now. The proportion of dual earner married couples with children more than 
doubled from 25% in 1960 to over 60% in 2012. (Women are the sole earners in about 6% 
of married couples.)23  Historically, because women did not have their own means of 
earning a living, they expected to marry men who were able to do so. It was reasonable 
to believe that once they had their own pay stubs and bank accounts, as they do today, 
men’s earning power would be far less critical to their decisions about who to marry. In 
fact, with women’s wages and education levels on the rise, it would make sense for more 
men to simply take on the roles of secondary earners or perhaps even become stay-at-
home dads.  
 
That’s not what’s happened. Instead, marriage, though not child bearing rates, 
plummeted. Why is that? To answer that question, consider Pew Research interviews 
with Americans about the qualities they think matter for husbands and wives. About 
seven-in-ten adults, both men and women, said that a good husband or partner should 
be able to support a family financially. Only thirty-nine percent of women and 25% of 
men held woman to the same standard. Traditional preferences for male breadwinners 
are even higher among those with less education. Eighty-one percent of those with high 
school or less and 71% of moderately education believe husbands should be able to 
provide financially for their families, while only 40% and 29% respectively said the same 
about wives. The demographer Yue Qian compared couples in the 1980 Census and in 
the 2012 American Community Survey and confirmed that men and women were 
following their stated preferences. Between the intervening decades, though wives grew 
more likely to marry down in terms of educational achievement, “the tendency for 
women to marry men with higher incomes than themselves persisted.”24 I’ve written 
recently about a study with very similar findings for couples in Sweden, one of the most 
egalitarian countries in the world.25 
 
The notion that men and women still prefer marriages where husbands earn at least as 
much as wives finds support in “Mismatches in the Marriage Market,” a widely cited 
paper published in 2019 in The Journal of Marriage and Family. The authors analyzed the 
socio-demographic characteristics of couples who married between 2008 and 2017.  
That data allowed them to create a profile of marriageable men for women with varying 
racial, economic and educational levels and compare them to the actual population of 
unmarried men at national, state, and local area levels. The already married men had 
58% higher income than the men currently available and were 30% more likely to be 
employed. 26 To put it simply, the economically desirable men were already taken. 
 
The “mismatch” between what women might want and the men available was larger for 
minority, and especially African-American, women than for their white peers. A Pew 
survey confirmed that  “[N]ever-married women place a high premium on finding a 
spouse with a steady job,” the authors write.  Yet the number of never-married employed 
men between 25 and 34 per 100 women plunged from 139 in 1960 to 91 in 2012, even 
though there are more men than women in that age group. The ratio for black men and 
women is considerably worse: there are only 51 employed young black men for every 100 
young black women. The share of blacks who have never been married has quadrupled 
over the past half century—from 9% in 1960 to 36% in 2012. 27  With these ratios, it’s not 
surprising.  
 
In short, despite women’s extraordinary gains over the past decades in educational 
achievement, income, and occupations, both sexes still expect husbands to earn at least 
as much as their wives do. Women who can’t find such men will choose not to marry. 
Judging from their behavior thus far, either they will become single mothers or not have 
children at all.  
 
This leads me to the following conclusion: to ensure more children grow up in stable, 
two parent families, we have to focus our attention on young men, particularly less 
educated and minority men. I would suggest three areas of attention. 
  
First, the nation’s schools have to pay more attention to their boy problem. Boys are 
already behind girls when they enter school.28 They read and write later than girls and 
the gaps widen over time. Educators often find boys lose interest in their classes by 
middle school as reading material becomes more challenging.29  Relatedly, boys are two 
times as likely to be suspended as girls,30 and 40 percent more likely to drop out of high 
school.31  Educators have been invested in improving the outcomes in science and math 
for girls over the past decades; they need to show the same commitment to addressing 
boys’ lagging reading skills,32 testing out new approaches that might improve boys 
performance. To cite just one potential avenue, there’s some evidence that boys benefit 
from more structured reading instruction than many schools offer. 33  
 
The second change needed to improve boys’ outcomes is increasing both the number 
and prestige of trade schools, apprenticeships, and career and technical training. The 
training offered in these schools should be holistic. They should be attending to 
students’ “soft skills,” their work ethic, perseverance, dependability, civility, and the like. 
I’ve included in the record an article about one such trade school that has successfully 
taught mechanical skills and social competence for generations of disadvantaged 
men.34  
 
The third area of attention is admittedly less amenable to government policy, but is no 
less crucial to addressing the marriageable men problem: a re-affirmation of the 
importance of fathers and male contributions to the household. These days, according to 
surveys, girls and young women have stronger career aspirations than men.35 It sounds 
surprising at first but think about it. Society has come to accept single motherhood; in 
fact, it is the norm in many disadvantaged communities. I would propose that this 
seeming social progress has had unintended effect of telling boys and men that their 
contributions to family life and the household economy are of no great consequence. 
Why study, plan, show up for work on time, or go to work when you’re sick of your boss if 
no one is depending on you, and no one cares?   
 
Thank you for your attention.

own views and not those of any organization with which I am affiliated. Thank you for 
having me here today. 
 
If your only sense of the state of our unions was drawn from pop culture and the prestige 
press, you could be forgiven for thinking that the state of marriage and family life in America 
is dire. From the Oscar-winning movie Marriage Story, which leaves the impression that 
divorce remains an endemic feature of married life, to the title of the new Atlantic cover 
story, “The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake,” much of today’s culture paints a dark portrait of 
the state of our unions.1 
 
The Good and Bad News About Family in America 
 
But, in truth, the data tell a sunnier story than you might get from just following pop culture 
and the prestige press. There is good news about marriage and family life in America; news 
that is underreported and not well-known by the general public. First, as Figure 1 indicates, 
divorce is down more than 30 percent since the height of the divorce revolution in 1980, and 
it seems to be headed lower. This means the fabled statistic — that one-in-two marriages 
end in divorce — is no longer true. A clear majority of marriages today will go the distance. 
Second, in the wake of the Great Recession, the decades-long increase in nonmarital 
childbearing has come to a halt and is now falling, albeit modestly.

Less divorce and nonmarital childbearing equal more children being raised in intact, married 
families. In fact, as Figure 2 shows, since 2014, the share of children being raised in an intact, 
married family has climbed from 61.8 to 62.6 percent. An uptick in children living in intact 
families has been strongest for black children and children born to disadvantaged mothers, 
  1 
as Figure 3 suggests. The good news about family in America, then, is that a growing share 
of children are being raised in intact, married families.

The bad news, by contrast, is that the nation still faces a deep divide when it comes to family 
structure and stability, with children from black and less-educated homes still facing 
markedly higher rates of family instability and single parenthood. Single parenthood is about 
twice as high for children from families with less education and for black children, compared 
to children, respectively, from college-educated families and children from white and Asian 
families.5 This form of family inequality is particularly troubling because it leaves many 
  2 
working-class and poor children “doubly disadvantaged”—navigating life with fewer 
socioeconomic resources and an absent parent.6  
 
The Roots of Family Inequality 
 
This family inequality has been driven by shifts in the economy, culture, and public policy.7 
Economic gains since the 1970s have disproportionately gone to the most-educated 
Americans. By contrast, Americans without a college degree — especially men — have not 
seen marked wage gains, even as employment instability and nonparticipation have increased 
precipitously for less-educated men.8 This matters because stable employment is a powerful 
predictor of men’s odds of getting and staying married.9 
 
But growing inequality in family life is not simply an economic story; shifts in culture, civil 
society, and policy have also had a hand in the family changes of the last half-century. Since 
the 1960s, American culture has de-emphasized many of the values and virtues that sustain 
strong and stable marriages in the name of “expressive individualism.”10 But what is 
interesting about this well-known cultural trend is that a cultural countercurrent has quietly 
emerged in recent years among elite Americans: While America’s educated elite 
overwhelmingly reject a renewed marriage-centered ethos in public, they embrace a 
marriage-centered ethos for themselves and their children in private, thereby affording their 
families a significant cultural advantage when it comes to forging a strong and stable family 
life.11 Unfortunately, it seems this marriage-minded ethos has not yet caught on as much in 
less-advantaged communities.12 
 
Likewise, declines in religious and secular civic engagement have been concentrated among 
working-class and poor Americans, thereby robbing these families of the social support they 
need to thrive and endure.13 Finally, means-tested programs and policies from the federal 
government often penalize marriage among lower-income families.14 Taken together, these 
shifts have weakened the strength and stability of family life in poor and working-class 
communities across the United States. 
 
The shift away from stable marriage over the last half-century has also hit African American 
families especially hard for two sets of reasons. First, the legacy of slavery and the ongoing 
reality of American racism have exacted a toll on black families since the postbellum era.15 
Slavery’s “ethnocidal assault” on black marriage and black men left its mark on black family 
life, and the economic and social stresses and injustices of racism — from racist policing to 
redlining — have made black relationships and family life much more difficult.16  
 
Second, the economic and policy changes of the post-1960s world have had a disparate 
impact on the black family. For instance, from an economic perspective, the shift to the 
postindustrial economy has proved particularly difficult for the economic fortunes of black 
men; similarly, on the policy front, the rise of mass incarceration has taken a toll on black 
family life.17 All these factors and more have left African American families more deeply 
affected by the post-1960s changes in American family life than any other group. 
  3 
Why Family Structure and Stability Matter 
   
The family divide in America matters because the American Dream is in much better shape 
when stable marriage anchors the lives of children — and the communities they grow up in. 
My use of the term “marriage” here is deliberate. No family arrangement besides marriage 
affords children as much stability as does this institution. For instance, children born to 
cohabiting couples are almost twice as likely to see their parents break up, compared to 
children born to married couples, even after controlling for confounding sociodemographic 
factors such as parental education.18 Figure 4, which displays the likelihood that children will 
see their parents break up by age 12 for different levels of education and different 
relationship statuses, is emblematic of the superior stability of married families in America.19

I cannot here summarize the voluminous literature on family structure and child well-being. 
But outcomes related to education and economics are suggestive of the ways in which 
marriage advantages children. When it comes to education, for instance, children raised in 
stable, married families are more likely to excel in school, generally earning higher grade 
point averages.21 The effects of family structure are typically stronger for social and 
behavioral outcomes related to schooling, such as school suspensions, schools contacting 
parents about child behavior, and dropping out of high school.22 Research also indicates that 
children from married homes are more likely to attend and graduate from college.23 In other 
words, children are more likely to acquire the human capital they need to flourish in today’s 
competitive marketplace when they are raised in stable, married families. 
 
  4 
The relationship between family structure and children’s economic well-being is also well 
established. Because families that have two parents are more likely to have not only a full-
time earner but also two earners, children in stable, married families enjoy markedly higher 
income and lower risks of poverty and material deprivation.24 Figure 5 indicates that children 
living in single-parent homes are at least two times more likely to be in poverty compared to 
children in married-parent families.  
 
Obviously, much of the association between family structure and child economic well-being 
is about selection effects: Married parents tend to be better educated and employed in better-
paying jobs, even before they marry.25 However, part of the marriage effect seems to be 
causal, as well; that is, marriage increases the odds that families have access to two earners, 
reduces the odds that households go through costly family transitions such as a break up, 
engenders more support from kin, and fosters habits of financial prudence including more 
savings.26 Indeed, research suggests that child poverty would be markedly reduced if the 
nation enjoyed 1970s marriage levels.27 Likewise, when it comes to the racial divide in 
poverty, Penn State University sociologist John Iceland’s work indicates that the effect of 
family structure is “the most significant factor among blacks — not only for poverty, but 
also for affluence, explaining about a third of the [racial] disparity in poverty and affluence in 
2015.”28

Family structure also matters for communities. Scholarship by Harvard University economist 
Raj Chetty and his colleagues indicates that neighborhoods with more two-parent families 
are significantly more likely to foster economic mobility for poor children.30 In their words, 
“the strongest and most robust predictor is the fraction of children with single parents.”31 
They have also found that found that black boys are more likely to achieve upward economic 
mobility if there are more black fathers in a neighborhood — and more married couples.32 At 
the community level, we can see that strong and stable families — including father-present 
homes — are strongly linked to the health of the American Dream. 
 
  5 
Perhaps not coincidentally, neighborhoods, towns, and cities are also safer and less likely to 
function as pipelines into prison for our young men when they are anchored by strong and 
stable families. The work of Harvard sociologist Robert Sampson tells us that 
neighborhoods with many two-parent families are much safer; in his own words, “Family 
structure is one of the strongest, if not the strongest, predictor[s] of variations in urban 
violence across cities in the United States.”33 My own research indicates incarceration rates 
for boys are markedly lower in neighborhoods with lots of two-parent families. Using 
Chetty’s publicly available data set, my colleagues and I find that the share of single parents 
in a neighborhood is one of the most powerful predictors of later incarceration for young 
men.34 
 
In all these ways, and more, the research on family structure and stability tells us that the 
American Dream is more alive when intact, married families anchor the lives of children. 
  
Public and Civic Efforts to Bridge America’s Family Divide 
 
An increasing share of children today are being raised by married parents in a stable family 
environment. That is the good news. But the bad news is that a large divide in family 
structure and stability now marks American family life. The following public policy and civic 
measures would begin to bridge this divide, strengthening and stabilizing marriage and family 
life in the United States. 
 
•  End the Marriage Penalty in Means-Tested Programs. Currently, means-tested 
programs such as Medicaid, the earned income tax credit (EITC), and the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) often penalize low-income 
couples who choose to marry.35 These penalties fall particularly hard on working-class 
Americans, with one study showing that more than 70 percent of American families 
with young children with incomes in the second and third quintile face marriage 
penalties related to Medicaid, cash welfare, or SNAP receipt.36  
 
Studies suggest that these penalties can reduce the odds that lower-income families 
marry, and one survey found that almost one-third of Americans age 18 to 60 report 
they personally know someone who has not married for fear of losing means-tested 
benefits.37 Congress should eliminate, or minimize, marriage penalties facing lower-
income families with children age 4 and under by doubling income thresholds for 
means-tested programs and the policies serving married families — or pursuing other 
legislative remedies. 
 
•  Strengthen Career and Technical Education and Apprenticeships. One reason 
marriage is fragile in many poor and working-class communities is that job stability 
and income can be inadequate, especially for young adults without college degrees. 
This labor force reality can be remedied, in part, by scaling up career and technical 
education and apprenticeship programs.38 Raising the skills, earnings, maturity, and 
self-confidence of young men and women who are not on the college track would 
  6 
make forging strong and stable marriages more accessible to these Americans.39  
 
I endorse recent administration, congressional, and state initiatives to increase 
apprenticeships and shorter, simpler apprenticeship-like training programs in the US. 
Increased federal appropriations for apprenticeship (from about $30 million to $200 
million) have funded state expansion efforts, grants to community colleges, 
modernization and expansion of apprenticeships’ occupational range, and industry 
intermediary and equity projects. Congress should do more to expand 
apprenticeships and career and technical education and to make sure that young men 
and women who are pursuing these options have access to Pell Grants and other 
forms of federal aid in much the same way as their peers in four-year colleges and 
universities. One promising provision already under consideration in Congress is 
Workforce Pell — which would make Pell Grants available to shorter, job-focused 
community college programs that lead to industry-recognized credentials.40  
 
•  Subsidize Lower-Income Work. To strengthen the economic foundations of poor 
and working-class family life and to increase the returns of work for less-educated 
men and women, the federal government should subsidize lower-income work.41 A 
wage subsidy would reinforce the value of work and also send a powerful signal to 
working-class families that the nation stands with them. One approach would set the 
value of the subsidy relative to a “target wage” of $15 per hour and “would close half 
the gap between the market wage and the target” wage.42 Unlike the EITC, this wage 
subsidy would be added to worker’s paychecks, providing them with an ongoing, 
paycheck-to-paycheck boost to their family budget.  
 
•  Expand the Child Tax Credit. To help families cover the expenses of raising young 
children and reduce the financial stresses that can cause marital instability, Congress 
should also expand the child tax credit to $3000 per child and extend it to payroll tax 
liabilities or provide families with a fully refundable credit. The credit should be paid 
out on a monthly basis so as to give families additional month-to-month support in 
addressing the financial challenges of raising a family today.43 To limit the expense, 
this expansion should be restricted to children under 6. Families would continue to 
receive a $2000 credit for children aged 6–17, though this benefit would be paid out 
on a monthly basis as well. A monthly tax credit would send a powerful signal to 
parents that the nation stands with them in their efforts to raise the next generation.   
 
•  Launch Civic Efforts to Strengthen Marriage. In the realm of civil society, 
national, state, and local initiatives that educate Americans on the benefits of stable 
marriage could prove helpful. Campaigns against smoking and teenage pregnancy 
have taught us that sustained efforts to change behavior can work. I would like to see 
a civic campaign organized around what Brookings Institution scholars Ron Haskins 
and Isabel Sawhill have called the “success sequence,” in which young adults are 
encouraged to pursue education, work, marriage, and parenthood in that order.44 
  7 
Ninety-seven percent of young adults today who have followed this sequence are not 
poor.45 A campaign organized around this sequence — receiving widespread support 
from educational, civic, media, pop cultural, and religious institutions — might meet 
with the same level of success as the recent national campaign to prevent teen 
pregnancy, a campaign which appears to have helped drive down the teen pregnancy 
rate by more than 65 percent since the 1990s.46  
 
Initiatives like these are especially needed because elites tend to value marriage for 
themselves and their kids but are reluctant to communicate the value of a stable 
marriage to the wider public.47 This means many young men and women from poor 
and working-class communities grow up never knowing the value of a stable family 
life for their own economic prospects and those of their children. Initiatives relying 
on schools, community organizations, churches, and social media campaigns could 
help bridge this class gap in support of a marriage-centered orientation. 
 
Measures like the ones articulated above are necessary to bridge the divide in family structure 
and stability across the US. The alternative to acting decisively is accepting a world where the 
educated and affluent — and their children — hoard strong and stable families for 
themselves, and everyone else has a diminished shot at forging such families for themselves. 
Given the importance of strong and stable families for realizing the American Dream, it is 
imperative that federal, state, and local governments — as well as civil society — do all they 
can to ensure that every American man, woman, and child has an equal shot at forging a 
strong and stable family.

Chairman Lee, Vice Chair Beyer, and distinguished members of the Joint Economic Committee, 
thank you for the invitation to speak to you today about America’s families. I am an economist 
who has spent much of the past three decades trying to better understand families, 
employment, and how the two interact. Importantly, my focus has also included considering 
the ways in which policy choices help shape the decisions people make in their families and 
careers. For example, in my research I have shown that divorce law reform improved marriage 
by substantially reducing violence in marriage1. This counter-intuitive finding—making it easier 
to get divorced improved the quality of many marriages—points to how important it is that 
policy makers understand the nuanced way in which policy choices impact family choices. 
 
I was asked to speak today about changes in family life. The family is not a static institution.  In 
recent decades, marriage rates have fallen, but so too have divorce rates.

The divorce rate per thousand married couples (seen in the figure as the dashed green line) 
peaked in 1981 and has been declining since. The spike in divorce in the 1970s reflected both 
the young age at which that cohort married and social changes in the expectations for marriage 
and adult life.2 While the spike stands out, the divorce rate had been slowly increasing for many 
decades prior to World War II. Extending the pre-World War II trend (prior to both the post-war 
spike and the 1970s spike) forward to today, you can see that today’s divorce rate is well below 
what the pre-World War II trend would have predicted. The decline in the divorce rate over the 
past four decades has undone much of the 1970s rise. 
 
One explanation for the decline is that both men and women are waiting longer to marry and 
marrying at older ages is associated with a greater likelihood of a marriage surviving.3 Since 
2000, marriage patterns have diverged from the past, with lower rates of marriage at young 
ages and higher rates at older ages. The 1960s was also an outlier period in that an unusually 
large share of those in their 20s and 30s were married. 
Currently Married by Age 
 
(Data: US Census) 
 
Many point to the decline in marriage among the young—indeed among those 22 to 29 years 
old in 2018, only 26 percent had ever married. In comparison, 79 percent of 22 to 29 years in 
1960 had married. But much of this gap reflects a delay in marriage rather than marriage 
foregone. In fact, those ages 60 and over are more likely to have married and more likely to be

Fertility,” in John Shoven (ed.), Demography and the Economy, University of Chicago Press, 2011. 
currently married compared to those in almost any other time period. Marriage is thriving; it is 
simply thriving at older ages. 
 
While learning about our current wonderful era of older marriage may be welcome news, it 
does not address your primary concern: are children being raised in households that have 
sufficient resources to care for them? But understanding what makes older marriages thrive 
provides broader insight into families—the success of older marriages highlights the role of 
income and leisure time in helping today’s marriages thrive. More generally, to understand 
marriage it is necessary to realize that the increase in longevity means that children are no 
longer central to marriage as a larger share of adult life is spent without young children in the 
home. 
 
Some of the changing patterns in the age of marriage reflects our longer life expectancy. Those 
marrying in the 1950s had a life expectancy of roughly 60, while those marrying today have a 
life expectancy of roughly 80. Increasing longevity means that couples have the option of 
having more years together, delaying marriage, and/or divorcing. Despite the myth that 
marriages will survive if they withstand the crucial early years, divorce occurs at fairly steady 
rates at each year of marriage—there’s no magical number of years of marriage after which it 
becomes immune to dissolving.4 That’s why it is simultaneously true that Americans are both 
more likely to experience a marriage of 25 years or more and to experience divorce compared 
with people marrying a century ago.  
 
Rising life expectancy has also changed the role of children in marriage as a shrinking share of 
adulthood is spent with young children in the home. A century ago, women having children 
could scarcely expect to live beyond age 50 and the typical woman had roughly four children. 
Not surprisingly, many women’s entire adult lives were spent caring for children. In contrast, 
women today have a life expectancy of roughly 80 and have half as many children. As a result, 
women’s adult lives are no longer spent primarily raising children. This is not to say that 
children are not an important part of most people’s lives. In fact, there has been a reduction in 
the likelihood of never having children among women reaching childbearing age since 1960. 
More women have children, but they have fewer children, and parenting young children 
requires a smaller share of their adult lives.5 This also reduces the cost of a potential maternity 
leave policy: If women work between the ages of 22 and 72, they have 50 years in the labor 
force. If they take 6 months off for the birth of each of their two children, then only 2 percent 
of their working lives (1 year out of 50) will be spent taking leave to bond with a child.

5 Is There a Case for a ""Second Demographic Transition""? Three Distinctive Features of the Post-1960 U.S. Fertility 
Decline, Martha J. Bailey, Melanie Guldi, Brad J. Hershbein. Chapter in NBER book Human Capital in History: The

Just as marriage has been postponed, so too has childbirth. Children are born to mothers at 
increasingly older ages with a shift of the distribution from a large mass of people having first 
births in their 20s to many having their children in their 30s and 40s. For college educated 
Americans and for women in many developed countries, the median age of first birth is now in 
the 30s. The first birth among women with advanced degrees beyond college is even later. The 
New York Times article “The Age That Women Have Babies: How a Gap Divides America” shows 
the gap in age of first birth for women by education and marital status. Those without a college 
degree have their children out of wedlock and in their 20s, while those with a college degree 
have their children in their 30s and within a marriage.  
 
Many scholars have pointed to a bifurcation in families because women with less education and 
fewer options in the labor force are following a somewhat different pattern. Less educated 
women have postponed marriage but not childrearing and as a result have their children often 
prior to marrying, raising single children in much lower income households. While many 
bemoan the lack of a second parent, research shows that the fundamental problem stems from 
insufficient income and socioeconomic stress.6  
 
College-educated parents are often regarded as the model for successful parenting—their 
children are more likely to be raised in two-parent homes that have much higher incomes. This 
is driven as much or even more by the higher earnings potential of people in their 30s as it is by 
the dual income status of these married homes. College-educated parents spend more time 
with their children and more time intensive parenting.   
 
But this narrative hides two important facts. The first is that women with both high and low 
education levels are spending more time parenting than in the past. All parents are investing 
more in their children. The second fact is that many college graduates in middle-class families 
struggle to pay student loans, to save for the down payment on a home, and to get a stronger 
foothold in the labor market. The shift to having children at older ages reflects the desire by 
many people to establish their careers and achieve financial stability prior to having children. 
Research shows that women’s careers and wages stagnate after having children, a fact that 
leads many women to postpone having children as long as possible. Women and couples are 
making decisions about having children while considering the challenges of balancing work and 
children, the support they will get from their employer, the difficulty in arranging trustworthy 
children care, and the financial cost of having children.  
 
The birth rate in United States hit a record low in 2018 raising questions about why people in 
their 30s are having fewer children.7 In particular, Millennials are on track to have fewer 
children compared with previous generations. Millennials came of age during a deep recession 
and births typically decline during a recession because fewer people feel prepared to handle

the financial burden of having a child. Yet, we’re now ten years into an economic expansion and 
the unemployment rate has been below 5 percent since 2016. Such a strong economy is 
typically associated with higher birth rates. 
 
 
 
To be sure, one has to be careful interpreting the decline in births. Some of the decline is part 
of a long-run trend in the teenage birthrate, which has fallen by half since 2007. Birth rates of 
near-teens has also substantially declined over the past decade. Births to young mothers has 
fallen due to efforts to make it easier for younger women to avoid an accidental pregnancy and 
by a growing desire for young women to pursue higher education. 
 
 
 
The puzzle is that births for women in their early 30s has declined in recent years, as did births 
to women in their late 20s. Births to women in their late 30s and 40s rose, highlighting the 
continuation of women’s delays in fertility. 
 
 
 
To understand why women are continuing to further delay or even forego children, it is 
necessary to consider women’s role in today’s labor force. The majority of nonfarm payroll jobs 
are held by women.8 Women are getting higher education at much higher rates than men at a 
time when the college wage premium has never been higher.9 The majority of college-educated 
workers in the United States are women. This trend will continue since nearly 60 percent of 
those graduating from college today are women—meaning that in a decade an even greater 
share of college-educated workers will be female. It is important that policy makers concerned 
about families and children understand the crucial role that women are playing in the 
workforce. These women struggle to balance their careers with their families and have dealt 
with this struggle by delaying fertility to older and older ages. Women are crucial to the 
functioning of our economy, but workplace policies and government policies have not kept up 
with the emergence of women as primary or co-equal household earners. 
 
 
 
In my own research, I have found that the fundamental drivers of a successful marriage have 
changed as a result of technological change, increasing life expectancy, increasing globalization 
and international trade, greater living standards, and changing gender norms and 
expectations.10 For much of history families worked together in what some researchers have 
called the corporate family economy—families worked together on farms and in the home.11 As

the need for agricultural workers declined, the male breadwinner family emerged—a period in 
which men and women had separate spheres. Today’s families also work together in a shared 
mission, but now they operate much as they did in the days of the corporate family economy—
together in a shared pursuit of earning a living and raising children. Notably, the difference is 
that modern families have more equal roles for men and women in the home and in the 
workplace. Families of equality—in which men and women share the joys and daily tasks of 
childrearing—are today’s most successful families. College educated women were once the 
least likely to marry.12 Today they are the most likely to be married and they divorce at lower 
rates.

Fertility,” in John Shoven (ed.), Demography and the Economy, University of Chicago Press, 2011. 
The rise of marriages of equality have created a bigger role for fathers. Fathers today spend more 
time with their children, and are more actively engaged parents. Dads are increasingly playing 
the role of the primary caregiver in the household: 1 in 5 fathers are the primary caregiver of 
preschool-age children when the mother is employed.13 In the last 30 years, the number of 
families with stay-at-home dads and a working mom doubled,14 the number of father-only 
families more than doubled, and in 2019 nearly a quarter of single parents with children under 
age 18 were father-only households.15

In keeping with the shift in marriages to equal partnerships grounded in shared interests and 
background, in which both partners contribute to income and caregiving, fathers change diapers, 
give bottles, and bring children to and from school. Although fathers continue to spend less time 
on  childcare  than  mothers,  this  gap  has  narrowed  over  the  past  10  years,  and  dads  are 
increasingly performing caregiving activities traditionally done by mothers. Overall, fathers are 
spending more time on childcare and housework, and have not reduced their paid work hours by 
a commensurate amount. In 1965, fathers spent 49 hours per week doing paid work and taking 
care of their families; in 2012 that jumped to 54 hours per week.16 Fathers are doing 4.6 more 
hours of childcare per week and 4.4 more hours of housework per week.  
 
It is worth noting that fathers are now often the ones leading the charge to find a solution to 
work-family conflict.17 In 2008, 60 percent of dads in two-income couples reported work-family 
conflict compared with 35 percent in 1977.18 Men are also now more likely to seek jobs that allow 
more flexibility, require less travel, or include paid paternity leave.  
 
The changing role of fathers is impacting schools, employers, and healthcare. Neither schools 
nor employers can presume that fathers can ignore the call to come to a sick child’s help and 
take them home to rest or to the doctor for help. Pediatricians have noted that father’s 
involvement in children’s health and development has changed substantially over the past 
decade. 19 But many pediatricians have yet to recognize the shift and can do more to help 
fathers—married or not—play a more active and beneficial role in their children’s health and 
development.  
Policy Solutions 
 
Make Solving Maternal Mortality a National Priority 
A starting place to support families must be from the very beginning with the mothers who 
have children. Children cannot be raised in a two-parent family when one parent is lost in 
childbirth. The United States has the highest rate of women dying from pregnancy-related 
complications in the developed world and the rate at which women die from pregnancy and 
childbirth has been rising. More alarming are the racial disparities—African-American, Native-
American, and Alaska-Native women die are about three times as likely to die from pregnancy 
related complications compared to white women in the United States.20  
 
The number of children growing up in families in which a mother has died during pregnancy or 
childbirth may be small, but each case is devastating. More importantly, there are policies that 
Congress can enact right now to reduce maternal mortality. NPR reported that states devoted

only 6 percent of block grants under the Title V federal-state program supporting maternal and 
child health went to mothers health issues.21 Medicaid often fails to cover the cost of doulas, 
yet doulas and midwives provide affordable, effective care for women.22 Implicit discrimination 
leads to doctors to ignore black women’s reports of pain and complications. Funding for simple 
training in implicit discrimination can help doctors deliver better care. 
 
The first step in supporting children in families is ensuring that the women who birth these 
children survive and are healthy, and Congress should immediately support the research and 
provide the funding necessary to make pregnancy and childbirth as safe for all American 
women as it is for women in other developed countries.   
 
Provide federal paid family leave  
 
The next step to support families is recognizing the need for paid leave so that both fathers and 
mothers can bond with their new child. Paternity leave helps men build and develop as active 
caregivers. Maternity leave allows women to recover from pregnancy and bond with children. 
Research shows that parental time at home with a newborn has important long-run benefits for 
children.23 Research also shows that paid maternity and paternity leave leads to women’s 
greater likelihood of working and higher earnings following the birth of a child.24 To be clear, 
higher income helps families thrive and women’s labor force contributions help families 
succeed. So keeping women in the workforce has important positive effects on children. 
 
Many businesses have increased access to paid family leave because it is the profitable thing for 
them to do. But these policies are mainly about retaining highly-skilled, high-income women 
who are costly to replace.25 Government action is necessary to ensure that all families have 
access to paid leave. A federal paid leave policy is essential in helping to close the gap in 
inequality among children. There are many papers that you can turn to on the benefits of paid 
leave, but let me focus on the recommendations from a bipartisan working group.  
 
For the past several years, I have been part of a bipartisan working group on paid family leave 
run jointly by the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution. While there 
remain disagreements on some details, our group reached a clear and strong consensus that

the United States needs a federally funded paid family leave policy.26 Our consensus policy had 
four points of agreement:  
1.  Both men and women need access to paid leave. 
2.  A plan could and should be budget neutral by “splitting the costs of financing between a 
payroll tax and cutting government spending or tax expenditures elsewhere in a way 
that does not adversely affect low-income families.” 
3.  Benefits would be limited and targeted, specifically offering a 70 percent replacement 
rate with a benefit cap of $600 per week for a limited number of weeks. 
4.  There must be some job protection. 
 
In an era of soaring budget deficits, it is difficult for some members of Congress to get behind a 
new safety net program. However, it is clear that American children and parents need access to 
paid family leave in order to thrive. It is time for Congress to make this important issue a 
national priority. 
 
Affordable, high-quality early childhood education and childcare 
When parents go back to work after bonding with their new child, they need to be able to find 
affordable, high-quality childcare and early childhood education. The last several decades have 
brought tremendous strides in our understanding of children’s learning. Infants and toddlers 
take in the world around them at birth, laying the foundation upon which the rest of their 
knowledge will be built. Researchers have established that profound advances take place in 
individuals’ reasoning, language acquisition, and problem solving in early childhood. Children 
need age- and developmentally-appropriate play and learning from very early ages. We now 
know that it is not sufficient to begin a child’s education at kindergarten. However, there is 
great inequality in access to early childhood education. Yes, parents are investing heavily in 
their children—both mothers and fathers are spending more time with their children than 
earlier cohorts did, despite fewer children living in homes with a stay-at-home parent. But early 
childhood education requires knowledge about child development that not all parents have and 
most children will spend time with other caregivers.  
 
More than two-thirds of young children live in households in which all parents are working—
either a single working parent or a two-income household. Yet high-quality childcare is hard to 
find and is expensive. Families of children under the age of 5 spend $250 per week on average 
on childcare.27 A report by the Center for American Progress recently highlighted the large 
number of Americans who face job disruptions because of childcare problems. Both men and 
women leave jobs or refuse to accept better jobs because of the limitations imposed by their 
childcare constraints. Early childhood education helps children develop foundational skills and 
allows more parents to actively pursue careers. Government spending on early childhood

education is an investment. These early investments lead to higher earnings, better health, and 
more civic cooperation throughout children’s adult lives.28  
 
Recognize and support broader kinship relationships 
Grandparents are playing an increasingly important role in childrearing both for married and 
single parents. Grandparents may end up as the primary parent of a grandchild or may simply 
be an integral part of providing care. Many parents rely on extended family to help them 
balance the demands of raising children. Research shows that couples who live away from their 
parents are more likely to move toward their parents—the grandparents—once children are 
born. Public policy needs to consider the ways in which the role and responsibilities taken on by 
grandparents can be better supported and recognized.  
 
Higher wages for our lowest earners 
Many people point to the lower incidence of poverty among married couples and argue that we 
should help people marry in order to lower poverty. In reality, we should lower poverty in order 
to help people marry. More importantly, marriage promotion programs do not work. The 
programs that have been evaluated have found no beneficial effects for parents or for children. 
The reason is simple: Americans truly embrace marriage. In many other developed countries 
people have eschewed marriage for cohabitation. But Americans still hold marriage up as the 
ideal. The difficulty is affording it. Raising the minimum wage, making the Child Tax Credit fully 
refundable, and increasing the EITC—including for noncustodial parents—are all policies that 
help raise family incomes and therefore support children and their parents. There are current 
proposals to do this right now in Congress and urge you to take action on these commonsense 
ways to help families and family stability.

POLICIES TO IMPROVE FAMILY STABILITY 
 
Dr. Rashawn Ray 
David M. Rubenstein Fellow, The Brookings Institution 
 
Chair Lee, Vice Chair Beyer, and distinguished members of the Joint Economic Committee, 
thank you for inviting me to testify on “Improving Family Stability for the Wellbeing of 
American Children.” I am a David M. Rubenstein Fellow at The Brookings Institution. I am also 
an Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Maryland and the Executive Director of 
the Lab for Applied Social Science Research (LASSR). LASSR is a research center that 
regularly partners with government agencies, organizations, and corporations to conduct 
objective research evaluations and develop innovative research products such as our virtual 
reality work with law enforcement and incarcerated people. 
 
My written testimony centers on addressing three important questions:  
1)  What does recent research tell us about trends in family formation and stability? 
2)  How should these trends be interpreted?  
3)  What are polices that can improve family stability?  
 
 
TRENDS IN FAMILY FORMATION 
Figure 1 shows the distribution of household types from 1900 through 2017. In 1900, marriage 
represented slightly over 50% of households, peaking over 60% in the 1960s, and then 
decreasing to roughly 45% in 2017. When compared to 1900, single-parent households have 
only increased slightly. However, if 1960 is the comparison year, single-parent households have 
increased more dramatically. The percentage of households with an individual increased from 
about 5% in 1900 to roughly 30% in 2017. As young adults delay marriage for education and 
work, and older adults encounter divorce and the death of relationship partners, the households 
of one continue to be prominent in 21  century America. Yet, despite the high divorce rate, 
st
recent research by Cohen (2019) suggests that the divorce rate seems to finally be falling. 
Marriage is occurring later in life and the likelihood of staying married seems to be increasing 
among recently married couples.

A household type that is often not discussed is extend family arrangements. In 1900, extended 
family arrangements were about 30% of households and represented the second most prominent 
household type in the United States. This household type decreased into the 1980s but has grown 
since then. Similar to the issues facing Americans at the turn of the 20  century, families are 
th
pooling funds together to deal with stagnant wages, rising housing costs, and rising healthcare 
costs, illness, and elderly care. As of 2017, roughly 15% of households were composed of 
extended family members (many of whom are together out of necessity and not by choice).

Figure 2 uses 1960 as a benchmark to show changes in family and work arrangements over the 
past 60 years. In 1960, 65% of households were composed of married parents where the father 
worked for pay outside of the home and the mother worked inside the home as the caregiver and 
house worker. In 2017, this arrangement only represented 21% of households. Though research 
shows that people’s attitudes have changed about women working outside of the home, this shift 
is much more than cultural. It is structural. Most American families cannot survive on one 
income. This has been the case for a majority of Black and poor households for decades as 
unemployment and underemployment faced by Black men have propelled Black women into the 
labor force in ways that was not the case for White women. Consequently, the percentage of 
families where the mother and father work outside of the home has increased over 100% since 
1960 to represent 37% of all household types in 2017. The percentage of single-parent 
households has nearly tripled during this time. Not only has single-mother households increased 
from representing 8% of households in 1960 to representing 21% in 2017, but single-father 
households (about 1% in 1960) represented 5% of households in 2017.

Figure 3 shows the non-marital birth rate for teenage girls and young women. Concerning non-
marital births, the birth rate among teenage girls decreased from about 60 in the early 1990s to 
less than 20 in 2018. However, the percentage of non-marital births attributed to young adult 
women has substantially increased.  
 
Figure 4 shows the percentage of unwed parents living in different family arrangements. In 1968, 
nearly 90% of unwed parents were in single-mother households. Over the past 50 years or so, 
this percentage has decreased to about half of the households for unwed parents. In 2017, 35% of 
unmarried parents were in cohabiting households.  
 
Figure 5 shows father participation with their children by race. Defying stereotypes about 
deadbeat dads, Black men, compared to men in other racial groups, are more likely to bathe 
children, play and read to their children, take children to activities, help with homework, and talk 
with children about their day. And, Black men are much more likely to be involved in their 
children’s lives when not living with their children than White or Latino fathers. Still, this is not 
enough and fathers need to continue to increase their participation as caregivers and house 
workers within the home.

INTERPRETING TRENDS IN FAMILY FORMATION 
In order to understand trends in family formation, they must be interpreted through a lens that 
properly takes into account the disparities of the lives of families across race and social class. 
This is what Dr. Pamela Braboy Jackson and I did in our recent book How Families Matter: The 
Simply Complicated Intersections of Race, Gender, and Work. Jackson and I collected data from 
46 Black, White, and Mexican-American families living in middle America. We wanted to know 
how family formation and life experiences shape how people define and understand family.  
 
Rather than the bleak assessment of family that is commonly purported, we found something 
different among the families in our study. First, we found that the way people interpret family 
  5 
was different across race. As Figure 6 below shows, Black Americans were more likely than 
White and Mexican-Americans to include grandparents and extended kin as part of their family. 
Blacks and Whites were more likely than Mexican-Americans to include siblings. These findings 
are not simply about who is considered family. They speak to the ways that people are involved 
in our daily lives and how our structural locations in society vary. For example, we found that 
Black children and young adults, compared to Whites, were more likely to live with their 
grandparents. Blacks are more likely to assist financially across generations and Latinos are more 
likely to live in extended family households. These are not cultural family arrangements as much 
as they are structural survival strategies in an economic market that has rarely provided them 
with opportunities to live in autonomous, self-sufficient households.

Second, we found that the traditional family arrangement of a father working outside of the home 
and a mother staying home with the kids seems to be reserved for very high earners. Middle-
income and low-income families simply cannot afford this lifestyle choice. Third, we found that 
parents do not really “balance” work and family. Rather, they “juggle” their various 
responsibilities and frequently pray they do not drop or break anything.  Fourth, parents’ ability 
2
to manage family and work life is contingent upon structural forms of economic (e.g., income, 
autonomy, flexible work hours) and social capital (e.g., social support and networks). Flexible 
work hours and job autonomy allow many working professionals to play a “chess game” to make 
daily and weekly decisions about childcare, housework, and family activities. Working class 
parents, on the other hand, are more likely to play “checkers” and have little choice in the pursuit

to juggle work and family life. Interestingly, single parents were some of the savviest people in 
our study. The way they worked to make ends meet and show up for childhood activities is 
admirable. Unfortunately, many single-parents simply do not have the resources to keep up long-
term, especially if they are trying to pursue more education, work toward a credential for higher 
pay, or obtain a part-time job to get out of debt or save for their children’s college. 
 
Overall, families are surviving, but they are floundering. Resources and safety nets that were 
available in the 1940s, 1960s, and 1980s simply do not exist in 21  century America for a 
st
majority of families. 
 
 
POLICIES TO STABILIZE FAMILIES 
How can policies be used to improve family stability? My research suggests focusing on a living 
wage, high-quality jobs with family-friendly benefits, and affordable childcare. 
 
•  Living Wage 
There needs be a living wage so people can live. According to a Joint Economic 
Committee report, minimum wage is nearly $3 less in today’s dollars than its peak of 
1968.  The minimum wage is simply too low. People cannot live on this. Across race, 
3
these disparities are even worse as Black households earned about 60 cents on the dollar 
relative to White households in 2018. It is often easy to say that these disparities are due 
to racism, which is not necessarily false. Yet, I think there is a better interpretation more 
suitable for how we think about public and social policy. It mostly centers on where jobs 
are located. I say more below. 
 
•  High-Quality Jobs with Family-friendly Benefits 
Families need earners with high-quality jobs. Though low-employment across racial 
groups is a positive step, many of the jobs being created are not high-quality jobs that 
allow people to adequately provide for their families. People need jobs with family-
friendly benefits that include child leave policies and paid, flexible sick leave policies. 
Working Americans should not have to get a payday loan to pay for the doctor when their 
kid gets the flu or accidently breaks their arm on the playground. Equitable policies must 
help to stop penalizing parents who want to be with their children when they are sick. 
 
People living in areas with low-job growth face wage stagnation and unstable benefits 
packages. Blacks are more likely to live in or around areas with low job growth rates. 
Some of these cities including Detroit, Cleveland, and Baltimore are impacted by the 
historical and current legacy of redlining and restrictive covenants. Blacks are most likely 
to be in occupations set for to technical displacement (production, food service, retail, 
and clerical work). Based on job growth potential, Black men are underrepresented in the 
best 15 occupations and overrepresented in the bottom 15 occupations for men. 
Education and health professions, two occupations most resistant to technical

  7 
displacement, should be a focus of vocational and technical training in predominately 
Black communities.  
 
All of this is important because men find their identity in family via work. When work 
disappears, so does their identity within the family.  Though I think we need to expand 
4
how men view their familial identities, this is where we are. There is a mismatch between 
how boys are socialized and what they are capable of achieving in 21  century America, 
st
especially if you are Black, poor, and/or rural. 
 
•  Affordable Childcare 
Families need affordable childcare. I recently seen this firsthand. Over the past few years, 
I worked on a project with Black Onyx Management. We conducted a welcomeness 
study for Kosciusko County, Indiana, which is essentially the orthopedic capital of the 
country.  Kosciusko County is predominately White and rural. Some of the findings 
5
about their struggles with childcare were saddening. Nearly 25% of parents reported that 
either them or their spouse left a job because of childcare issues. People making about 
$45,000 a year, compared to people making over $100,000, were about 75% more likely 
to report that paying for childcare was difficult. Below are some of the common 
responses we received from the over 2,000 people who participated in the study. 
 
“I am retired raising my 2-year-old grandson. Affordable childcare is non-existent in this 
county.” 
 
“I am a stay at home dad because I got in a wreck and ended up switching roles with my 
wife. We do not make enough money to keep up with normal bills. I also don’t see it 
being worth it to have my kids get childcare and me get a job. The type of job I can get 
would not bring in enough money to make our younger children being watched by a 
stranger worth it after paying for the childcare.” 
 
“Lack of affordable and quality childcare in this area make it extremely difficult for both 
parents to work, resulting in more families having to depend on food stamps, Medicaid, 
and other government programs. If you are wealthy or known, you have more 
opportunities, as opposed to those who are in lower or working classes.”  
 
“I think childcare is too expensive. I make good money but can’t afford to live on my 
own with a child.” 
“When moving here from Fort Wayne a few years ago, I was appalled at the gap 
between the money from industry in this community against the lack of high quality 
AFFORDABLE childcare options and pre-k options. We must have more options for 
working parents. This community has a glaring gap in childcare. It’s a real struggle.”

I want to reiterate that these are people living in middle America were the cost of living is 
relatively low. Imagine what it is like living in cities today. I honestly do not know how families 
are making it. 
 
 
MY FAMILY STORY 
I would be remiss if I did not end my testimony with my own family story. As a researcher, 
rarely do I make myself salient in the process. However, given the topic, I think my own 
biography is relevant. I grew-up in a single parent household and have never seen my biological 
father before. I am now happily married to my high school sweetheart with two smart and 
talented boys. How did I get here?  
 
While in the Army, my mom, Joslyn Talley, got pregnant by a Sergeant on her base. She had a 
decision to make. Should she have an abortion, get out of the military to raise her child, or allow 
her parents to adopt her child? My mom decided to be honorably discharged and raise me. 
Considering my mom was admitted to West Point, her decision was even more consequential. 
Indeed, her admission to West Point as a Black woman in the late 1970s was remarkable. As the 
daughter of a 21-year veteran who served in two wars and received the Purple Heart and Bronze 
Star, it was even more noteworthy. 
 
When I was a child, my mother put herself through nursing school to become a Registered 
Nurse. As an infant, we were on welfare and lived in subsidized housing. With childcare and 
financial support from my grandparents and aunt, my mom made sure that I was always with 
family when she was working nights and studying. When I was in elementary school, my mother 
worked a full-time job and two part-time jobs to make ends meet. When I graduated from 
college, my mom told me that she cried when I made all-stars in baseball because she did not 
know how she would pay for it or attend the games. Interestingly, I never remember my mom 
missing a game or important school event. She may have come late or left early, but she was 
always there. I do not know how she did it.  
 
We also experienced a lot of housing instability. My mom and I moved 14 times by my 18  
th
birthday. She was constantly searching for proficient schools for me to attend. With the Majority 
to Minority bussing program in Atlanta, I was able to attend a school that many of my 
neighborhood friends could only dream about. It had a gifted program and I was fortunate to be 
admitted. The neighborhood school that I was zoned for did not have enough books or adequate 
heating, air, or lighting. The student-teacher ratio was astronomical and it was predominately 
Black. 
 
Since my mom was a nurse, I was able to socialize with physicians regularly. I shadowed them 
and went to lunch with them. And though my life was different than the physicians’ children, I 
gained access to a form of social and cultural capital that my neighborhood friends did not have. 
I graduated high school toward the top of my class, attended the University of Memphis on a full 
academic scholarship, and then attended graduate school at Indiana University to obtain my PhD 
in sociology. During graduate school, I was awarded fellowships from the National Science 
Foundation, National Institute of Mental Health, and the American Sociological Association. 
  9 
 
Altogether, I am the epitome of the success sequence. My mother was not. Yet, she is a 
remarkable woman. And, she had resources that helped her raise her son. The policies that I 
discussed in this testimony will allow working parents the ability to help their children achieve 
the American Dream and save federal and state government funding by decreasing the likelihood 
of future generations being in poverty.

Opening Statement  
JEC Hearing on “Improving Family Stability for the Wellbeing of Children” 
February 25, 2020, 2:15pm 
106 Dirksen Senate Office Building 
 
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for this hearing of the Joint Economic Committee. 
Today’s hearing will focus on the most important institution in our society—the family. 
As most members of this committee are aware, the American family is in a precarious state: 
although the vast majority of Americans still desire to marry, the marriage rate has declined for 
decades and stable family life has disappeared for millions of American children.  
The trends in family life are concerning: whereas just 5 percent of children were born to 
unmarried mothers in 1960, 40 percent of children are born to unmarried mothers today. 
Meanwhile, 30 percent of children today live without one or both parents, twice the proportion of 
children that lived without one or both parents 50 years ago. 
Over the past few years, the Social Capital Project has worked to document these trends in 
American “associational life,” the web of social relationships through which we pursue joint 
endeavors—our families, communities, workplaces, and religious congregations. The Project 
recognizes the family as a crucial source of these relationships, which is why our policy agenda 
aims to make it more affordable to raise a family and to increase the number of children raised 
by happily married parents.  
But although the Project has sometimes emphasized the social value stable family life provides, 
the declines in family stability have economic, physical, and emotional consequences as well. 
For a variety of reasons, children raised in single-parent families are far more likely to 
experience child poverty, less likely to graduate from high school or attend college, and less 
likely to be connected to the labor force as adults.  
In addition, children raised in single-parent families are less likely to have positive relationships 
with their parents, and are far more likely to experience physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. 
Page 1 of 3 
 
Conversely, children raised by two married parents in a healthy relationship are likely to be 
happier, healthier, and better prepared for life.   
The positive outcomes associated with stable home life are outcomes Americans want for all 
children, no matter their background. But tragically, the decline of the family is concentrated 
among some vulnerable groups, including minorities and low income families.  
For example, over two-thirds of births to black mothers and over half of births to Hispanic 
mothers occur outside marriage, and minority women are much more likely to see their 
marriages end in divorce. Meanwhile, two-thirds of births among non-college educated women 
occur outside marriage, and non-college educated adults are also less likely to stay married. 
Although these trends are most stark for disadvantaged groups, they affect us all.  
What factors have driven these declines in family stability? The breakdown of the family is at 
least partly caused by cultural changes that have reverberated throughout our society—including 
changing romantic norms that led to greater relationship ambiguity, a culture of individualism 
that too often emphasizes the desires of individuals over the wellbeing of the family, and the 
retreat from religion, which is one of the strongest supports of marriage and family life.   
But while cultural factors may have contributed to declining marriage rates over time, the federal 
government has also played an active role. For example, our government penalizes marriage 
through the welfare system and tax code.  
Our federal government should not be in the business of punishing marriage. Instead, it should 
support policies that strengthen marriage and thus improve the likelihood of family stability for 
children. State and local leaders should also seek ways to strengthen marriage and increase 
family stability.  
Some of us have been working toward that goal: today we will hear from expert panelists, who 
will speak to the state of the American family and address various policy solutions we might 
pursue. I look forward to hearing their testimonies on this critical topic.

CONGRESSMAN DON BEYER  
“Improving Family Stability for the Wellbeing of American Children” 
Joint Economic Committee Hearing 
Prepared Remarks 
February 25, 2020 
 
Thank you Chairman Lee.   
This is my first hearing as Vice Chair of the Joint Economic Committee. I feel 
privileged to be a member of the committee and to have the opportunity to work on 
issues that are of real importance to most Americans. 
I would like to thank former Vice Chair Carolyn Maloney for her leadership. And 
I’d like to thank Chairman Lee for his hard work, commitment and collegiality.  
Today, we are focused on family stability and the connection to the wellbeing of 
American children.   
We all share a commitment to the same goal—delivering the best outcomes for 
children, families and the economy. 
The question is—how do we get there? 
Teen pregnancy is at record low 
I want to start with good news. Teen pregnancy, which leads to poor health and 
economic outcomes for mothers and their children, is at an all-time low. 
Between 1991 and 2015, the teen birth rate dropped by almost two-thirds, thanks in 
part to the Affordable Care Act.  
This is an issue I have worked on for many years, and I think we can all feel good 
about the substantial progress that’s been made.  
Declining marriage rates largely are a result of economic challenges 
Part of the impetus for today’s hearing may be that marriage rates have declined in 
the past several decades. A good portion of that decline is the result of economic 
challenges.   
If you’re struggling financially, your wages haven’t gone up or you’ve lost your 
job—getting married is neither feasible nor practical. 
Hearing statement 
Perhaps less known is that divorce rates have also been falling. Since its peak in 
1980, the divorce rate has fallen to a 40-year low.  
Americans want to get their economic footing before marriage 
Young Americans today want to get their economic footing before they get 
married. They correctly understand that they must get an education or training to 
achieve financial success. They want to get a firm foothold on a career and earn a 
degree of financial stability.  
If they wait longer to get married, it’s not because they are anti-marriage. It’s 
because they are pragmatic. They are pro-success.  
They are adapting to current conditions—not wishing for a return to the past. 
And the reality is that the traditional male-breadwinner model of the past failed to 
work for so many—as wages stagnated and the costs of housing and college soared 
higher and higher. 
Traditional family structures are not the only path to success 
My friends on the other side sometimes talk about the so-called break down of 
family and the increase in households headed by single mothers. 
It’s true, that as people delay marriage, there are more babies born to unmarried 
parents. That holds across demographic groups and race. And it’s true in the 
United States and elsewhere. 
But what the research also shows is that children raised by loving adults do 
well. There are lots of loving and supporting arrangements.   
It’s also true that fathers today spend significantly more time caring for their 
children than in previous generations—in fact, three times as much as in 1965.  
On average, the households with the highest incomes are married with both 
spouses working. But not every household is going to look like that and the 
government should be working to support children in all types of families—
especially those with access to only limited financial resources. 
Real challenges facing families are economic 
The real challenges facing families—whether living in small rural communities or 
large metro areas—are economic. 
Page 2 
Hearing statement 
Forty-four percent of workers earn just $18,000. And many are working two and 
three jobs. 
Millions of American families are one accident, one car breakdown, one trip to the 
emergency room from financial crisis or ruin. 
When people are living paycheck to paycheck, when wages are basically where 
they were 40 years ago, is it any wonder adults postpone marriage? 
We should invest in proven programs 
Step number one, then, is to do more to help people build their financial base.   
Increase the minimum wage. Expand the EITC. Provide affordable, quality child 
care. Protect nutritional supports. Ensure workers have real bargaining power—to 
negotiate wage increases, predictable hours and better working conditions.   
Children whose families benefit from expanded EITC are more likely to graduate 
high school and enroll in college. 
Similarly, access to SNAP leads to better educational and health outcomes. 
If we care about child outcomes, we should invest in programs that drive those 
outcomes higher. 
We need “family-friendly” policies like paid leave  
Making paid family leave a reality—for women and men—would be another 
important step. 
I’m pleased and encouraged that federal workers will be able to take 12 weeks paid 
leave to care for a newborn or adopted child. 
We should expand that same policy to workers in the private sector. 
Government policies need to catch up to the way Americans live 
Finally, part of the challenge for families is that our government hasn’t kept pace 
with the way people are living their lives.  
For example, the share of multigenerational households is growing, but our 
policies haven’t changed. 
Page 3 
Hearing statement 
Grandparents and aunts and uncles are taking care of kids—they’re doing a great 
job. But, often they can’t access family leave or food assistance or other important 
supports that would help. 
We need to catch up.  
I thank all of the witnesses for being here today, and I look forward to your 
testimony.

Chairman’s statement on electrification hearing 
 
September 22, 2021 
 
Mr. Vice Chairman, 
Climate change is a threat not only to our planet and our health but also to our 
economy. It is a crisis that becomes more deadly and costly every year. Just this 
past month, we witnessed catastrophic weather events from fires in the West to 
hurricanes in the South to flooding in the Northeast—events that devastated 
communities. But it isn’t just homes in the path of this extreme weather that are 
susceptible to the negative consequences of climate change. We know that every 
American household feels its effects, and that low-income families and 
marginalized communities are disproportionately impacted. 
To limit global warming and the expensive and life-threatening extreme weather 
events that come with it, we, as a nation, must act now to aggressively move 
towards a zero-carbon economy. To achieve our climate goals, we must look at a 
multitude of solutions.  
Electrifying homes and buildings is an important component of addressing the 
existential threat of climate change. The benefits of electrification go beyond the 
environmental and health benefits of lower global temperatures. Electric devices 
are safer and cheaper to operate than alternatives. These technologies help reduce 
residential energy costs, which boosts household disposable income—a boon to 
local businesses across the country—and improves public health outcomes.  
Unfortunately, the upfront cost of investing in residential electrification 
technologies and appliances can be a significant obstacle for many families. 
Economic barriers and a lack of financing options may stand between homeowners 
and long-term investments in lower-cost electric appliances. We know that many 
households lack the financial capacity to spend upfront on improvements that will 
generate future savings. Research tells us that more than 1/3 of American families 
would struggle to afford a $400 emergency, and most of these upgrades are 
precisely that type of emergency.  
Another challenge consumers face in investing in residential electrification is that 
many older homes and buildings in the United States were not built to 
accommodate complete household electrification. Older housing stock often 
requires building upgrades to handle modern electric devices. Additionally, the 
ideal time to upgrade to the latest technology is often when an in-service device 
fails; however, coordinating more involved upgrades takes time that owners may 
not have when a furnace dies on a freezing winter evening. Furthermore, many of 
the skilled trade workers who install household appliances lack the time and 
resources to become trained on new technologies, creating additional supply chain 
barriers.  
A number of market failures also stand in the way of broad adoption of 
electrification technologies. For example, landlords and homebuilders, who 
purchase many of the appliances families use, do not pay the operating costs of 
these units or breathe the air they operate in, creating incentives to underinvest in 
technology, safety and efficiency.  
Market failures disproportionately impact low-income households, which spend 
the largest share of rent on utilities. This is particularly true in rural areas where 
many houses are connected to the electric grid, but are forced to pay high heating 
bills because HVAC systems have locked them into using high-cost fuels like 
propane or oil-fired heat. This mismatch can be even more acute with 
manufactured and mobile homes, a key source of affordable housing. Mobile 
homes use more energy per square foot than traditional construction and often rely 
on high-cost fuels, especially in rural settings. 
Well-designed policies can help overcome a number of economic barriers and 
market failures that stand in the way of the adoption of electrification technologies. 
This is why I, along with my colleague Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, recently 
introduced the Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Act, which helps building 
owners with the costs of installing energy-efficient technology. Electrifying 
buildings puts businesses in a position to leverage investments in clean electricity 
Page 2 
into reduced emissions and lower energy bills. We must make these opportunities 
available to families and residential building owners as well. 
We must also implement policies that make it easier for all families to upgrade to 
the latest zero-emissions technology to ensure that the gains from building 
electrification are broadly shared. Policies, such as point of sale rebates, would 
help families capitalize on opportunities to replace outdated and inefficient 
appliances, save money on energy bills and live in safer homes with less indoor 
pollution.  
The scale of the challenges our planet is facing as a result of climate change is 
great. We must take this opportunity to deploy every tool at our disposal to meet 
the moment. Investments in electrification technologies can—and should—be part 
of that solution.

Opening Statement 
JEC Hearing on “Examining the Economic Benefits of 
Electrifying America’s Homes and Buildings” 
Wednesday, September 22 at 2:30 p.m. ET 
 
Our country needs to modernize the way we generate, 
transmit, and distribute electricity. Over the last year, 
devastating blackouts have harmed communities across 
the country, from New York to California to Texas. The 
U.S. electric grid has at times proven inadequate for the 
needs of American families.    
 
However, the answer is not to spend billions of federal 
taxpayer dollars to electrify every American home and 
business, and—just as importantly—the answer is not to 
fundamentally alter federal policy to regulate energy 
generation and consumption. Instead, we need to 
unshackle American industry so that new and diverse 
energy sources can help create a more resilient energy 
future. 
  
It was not that long ago that American innovation 
unleashed the shale revolution, driving down natural gas 
prices and providing a cleaner energy option for homes 
and businesses. We need a similar revolution if we want to 
modernize our electric grid.  
1 
 
 
To clear a path for continued energy innovation, we must 
reform existing regulatory policies that stand in the way of 
investors and discourage entrepreneurs. If we want to 
move our energy infrastructure into the future, we need to 
address environmental review. 
 
When President Nixon signed the National Environmental 
Policy Act—or NEPA—into law, it was meant to require 
agencies to consider the environmental consequences of 
their actions. NEPA is generally implicated when projects 
use federal funds or touch federal lands, which many 
energy projects do.  
 
Fifty years later, this seemingly commonsense 
requirement has transformed into a process that requires 
an average of four and a half years—and sometimes 
almost two decades—of paperwork and litigation. The 
NEPA process frequently discourages and prevents 
critical energy infrastructure projects from being built. 
 
The delays might be worth it if NEPA protected the 
environment. But environmental review is strictly 
procedural, meaning that it doesn’t actually privilege 
environmental protection.  
 
2 
 
This means that paperwork and lawyers’ fees are the most 
consistent result of the NEPA process. Federal agencies 
can find that the action under consideration imposes 
environmental harm and then theoretically decide to 
approve the project anyway. The process even delays 
projects with clear environmental benefits.  
 
Without reform, NEPA leaves countless energy 
infrastructure projects in a state of bureaucratic limbo, 
sidelining workers, stunting innovative new technologies, 
and leaving communities across the country to wait for 
Washington to approve their future.  
 
That’s unacceptable, and it’s why I’ve introduced the 
UNSHACKLE Act. This suite of bills reforms the NEPA 
process so that federal agencies are better empowered to 
carry out the law’s original intent, while also making our 
nation’s infrastructure projects affordable again. 
 
The UNSHACKLE Act would require agencies to finish 
environmental assessments faster, allow them to reuse 
paperwork, and limit duplicative work at state and federal 
levels. It would apply a two-year deadline for completion of 
the entire NEPA process, provide fair legal parameters 
around project reviews, and allow states to handle NEPA 
review within their own borders.  
3 
 
 
These reforms shouldn’t be a partisan issue. They are 
designed to achieve something that we all can agree on—
more efficient, effective federal permitting for infrastructure 
projects.  
 
Ultimately, the best energy future is one that allows the 
American people to innovate. Americans have made great 
strides pursuing breakthroughs in energy extraction, 
production, and technological innovations in wind, solar, 
hydro-electric, and other renewable forms of energy in the 
face of heavy-handed government control. Removing 
existing regulatory burdens will allow Americans to build a 
more sustainable future. 
 
The ability to build, and build more quickly, will help make 
the U.S. electric grid more robust, resilient, and reduce the 
frequency of outages. It will provide cleaner, more 
affordable, more reliable power to American families and 
communities.  
 
 
As we rebuild after the pandemic, we must liberate our 
energy sector. We must reduce regulatory barriers to 
developing nuclear, hydro, geothermal, and other forms of 
4 
 
energy. These technologies can be an important part of a 
competitive energy sector and a diverse energy future.  
 
Let’s get government out of the way and allow Americans 
to do what they do best. Reforming policies that get in the 
way of modernizing our energy infrastructure will boost 
economic prospects for American families, improve the

hopeful that today’s hearing will convince us of the urgent 
need to achieve that goal.

Statement before the Joint Economic Committee
Hearing on “The Gender Wage Gap: Breaking Through Stalled Progress”
Misdiagnosis Leads to Ineffective Policy

Chairman Beyer, Ranking Member Lee, and distinguished members of the Joint Economic
Committee, good afternoon.
Thank you for inviting me to discuss the gender wage gap.
My name is Romina Boccia and the views I express in this testimony are my own and should not
be construed as representing any official position of my employer, current or former.
I am a first-generation immigrant and naturalized American citizen. I believe in the American
Dream—that ours is a country that provides opportunity for all to make something of themselves
with hard work, a little bit of help, and some luck.
I was raised by a single mom with a physical disability and mental health problems. We were on
welfare for most of my childhood years. I started working when I was only 11 years old and have
been working ever since.
As a woman who is the sole breadwinner in her family, I personally know how important it is for
women to be treated equally in the workplace. We can not afford to be discriminated against on
the basis of sex or any other factor that is not directly related to our performance. It would also
be unfair and bad for business.
And I also know that neither men nor women necessarily earn what they are worth,
automatically. We earn what we negotiate. Both market factors outside of our control (such as a
recession) and factors at least partially within our control (such as skill level) affect our
negotiation power. On both the employer and employee side it matters greatly what alternatives
we have available.
I have studied the gender wage gap question for more than a decade. It is one of the most
misleading policy issues today.
The average person assumes that policymakers who refer to the gender wage gap as evidence
for discrimination must be comparing apples and apples: men and women working under the
same conditions, in the same jobs, putting in the same hours etc. But that is not the case.
The gender wage gap compares apples and oranges. When you divide the median wage of all
full-time working women by the median wage of all full-time working men—without adjusting for
any of the important factors that explain obvious differences in earnings—you inevitably arrive at
a highly misleading statistic.
Earnings are primarily a function of productivity. Only after accounting for all measurable,
explanatory factors can we reasonably discern whether the gender wage gap is a useful signal
alerting us to an actual problem, like discrimination based on sex, or largely a function of men
and women making different choices. Relevant factors include:
● Hours worked. Women work, on average, 10% fewer hours than men. This holds true
even in highly regulated work environments that leave little room for wage discrimination.
For example, a study examining the earnings of male and female bus and train operators
for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority identified that women earned 89% of
what men earned, concluding that “while having the same choice sets in the workplace,
women and men make different choices.”1 Women in this study chose to work only half
as many overtime hours as men and took an average of 17.5 days of unpaid leave
compared with 10 days of leave for men. If women worked more hours and days, on
average, than men, they would earn more than men (at least in this specific setting).
● Education and what economists refer to as human capital. More-educated and
highly skilled workers generally produce more and earn more. Young women are now
earning more university degrees (from bachelors to doctoral degrees) than men and we
observe a gender wage gap in reverse in major metropolitan areas—among childless,
college-educated women.2 That changes once women have children and begin to
reduce their hours or take more time off from work for caregiving.
● Experience and overall tenure. Employees become more productive as they gain more
experience. Women are more likely to interrupt their careers for caregiving, primarily for
children, but also for elder care. Biology, culture and gender socialization play a great
role in who takes on caregiving responsibilities in a family. While some countries have
taken aggressive measures in an attempt to equalize parental leave policies, public
policy is a blunt tool to address this primary choice gap.
● Benefits. Cash wages make up roughly two-thirds of workers’ total compensation.
Non-cash benefits, such as health coverage and paid leave, make up the rest.
Employers consider the total compensation they provide their employees but the gender
wage gap does not account for benefit differentials. Women are more likely than men to

work in industries that provide more of their compensation as benefits, including in
government, education, and nonprofit organizations.
We should first diagnose the problem accurately to determine whether public policy is the right
tool to address it, or whether there is a problem to address at all. In everything we do, we must
also consider the unintended consequences, not merely the intended outcome.
There is little, if any, evidence of widespread discrimination in wages and employment based on
gender in the U.S. In those rare cases where employers do discriminate based on gender, the
Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act provide legal protections for individuals who are
discriminated against based on several protected factors.
Some argue that the Equal Pay Act needs additional teeth by amending it with provisions in the
proposed Paycheck Fairness Act. The details of the Paycheck Fairness Act suggest, however,
that it was written for the benefit of trial lawyers and those who seek government control over
employer compensation decisions, not for the primary benefit of women.
Beyond asking employers to prove that wage and employment differentials are due to “factors
other than sex,” under the new act employers would need to prove that differentials are a
“business necessity” for which there is no alternative employment practice. It would be up to the
courts to define what constitutes such a business necessity. Lawyers would have their hay day
while women—especially working mothers who value flexibility or reduced hours—would likely
find it harder to find employment and face reduced promotion prospects.
The act would also lift the cap on compensatory and punitive damages, thereby greatly
increasing employers’ potential liability. Employers’ higher insurance costs to ward off this
greater legal liability would most likely be paid for by reducing employee wages and by hiring
fewer workers. That would hurt employees across the board, but benefit lawyers’, creating
potential “jackpot justice” pools. We should stick to gambling at the casino, not with peoples’
livelihoods in the workplace.
Another risk is that the Paycheck Fairness Act would move the U.S. economy closer to a
“comparative worth” pay regime with governments playing a more active role in determining
“fair” pay structures. Politically-driven wage levels and more rigid pay structures would likely
reduce performance and productivity, as well as limiting employers’ ability to accommodate
workplace flexibility (such as reduced hours, flexible hours, reduced travel etc).
Reporting requirements proposed in the Paycheck Fairness Act (as well as in executive orders)
regarding pay by gender, and subsequent Labor Department pay guidelines seem innocuous
enough on the surface. And yet, they would likely motivate employers to adopt more rigid pay
structures and, thus, less-flexible work arrangements, taking away a highly valuable benefit from
women.
3
Employers may also avoid performance-based pay, such as bonuses that encourage and
reward excellence, to protect themselves against legal claims. Such a one-size fits all approach
promises to reduce productivity and limit employee’s choices. Importantly, it fails to recognize
and reward individual contributions, negatively affecting motivation and employee wellbeing.
Denmark implemented a pay transparency law, called the 2006 Act on Gender-Specific Pay
Statistics, that required firms with more than 35 employees to report pay by gender (among
other factors). A subsequent study identified that although there was a slight reduction in the
gender pay gap, it came at the cost of 2.8 percent decline in total pay as productivity declined.
When both men and women end up earning less in order to correct some perceived, though not
necessarily actual injustice, everyone is made worse off.3
Other policies proposed to assist women, such as mandatory paid leave, also do more harm
than good. Such policies are often proposed with the stated intent of helping women who act as
caretakers for children or elderly parents to meet those responsibilities without losing valuable
pay. Such mandates come at a high cost. A Cornell study from 2015 identified that women hired
after the 1993 Family Medical Leave Act (which mandated leave without pay) were 8 percent
less likely to get promoted. This could happen if women ended up taking more leave than before
the act or because employers expected them to.4 Moreover, countries with more generous
family leave policies end up creating higher gender wage gaps.5
One policy change that carries great promise is the Working Families Flexibility Act introduced
by Senator Lee (R-UT). It would enable millions of lower-wage workers to accumulate paid
family leave by eliminating a current regulation that prohibits employees who work in the private
sector from choosing between pay and paid time off for any overtime hours worked. Importantly,
it imposes no new mandates. Rather, it expands choices.
Under current law, workers who are paid hourly (generally those earning the equivalent of
$35,568 per year for a full-year worker) must receive overtime pay at a rate of time-and-a-half if
they work more than 40 hours in any week. Giving these workers the option exchange some
overtime hours for paid time off would increase access to paid leave where it’s most needed.
Opponents claim that employers would take advantage of workers and force them to take paid
time off instead of paying them for overtime hours. The bill explicitly prohibits this and requires
that workers be able to cash out their accrued comp time at any time during the year.

As policymakers seek to “break through stalled progress” as indicated in today’s hearing title,
they should first seek to more deeply understand how wages are determined and not take the
raw gender wage gap as evidence of a problem. To the extent that free men and women make
very different choices—whether due to biology, culture, or gender socialization—the outcome of
those choices should not be misunderstood as somehow unfair or unjust. Government
mandates or increasing liability for employers are most likely to backfire, hurting the very same
people those policies are supposedly intended to help.
Everyone, regardless of gender, should be able to earn their worth (based on the value they
add), and not be subject to unfair discrimination. The best thing policymakers can do is to
expand choices and create the regulatory conditions that allow the economy to thrive, creating
more opportunities for workers which expands the number and quality of jobs available to them
and as such increases their negotiating power.

Opening Statement  
JEC Hearing on “The Gender Pay Gap: Breaking 
Through Stalled Progress” 
Wednesday, June 9th, 2021, 2:30 p.m. ET 
Remote 
 
Good afternoon and thank you to Chairman Beyer for convening today’s 
hearing on this topic. 
Women make unique and invaluable contributions to our families, 
communities, and workplaces. And thankfully, the opportunities for women 
in the workplace have grown tremendously over time. 
The female labor force participation rate has doubled over the last 50 
years. And American women have not simply joined the workforce but they 
have excelled and become leaders in it. In fact, the United States has a 
higher share of female managers than almost every other OECD nation. 
I myself am fortunate to benefit from the skills and expertise of my female 
chief of staff, female legislative director, female chief counsel, and female 
staff director here on the Joint Economic Committee. So, I am personally 
grateful for the fruits of women’s economic progress and freedom. 
Additionally, I am the father of an unbelievably gifted and intellectually 
curious daughter. For this and many other reasons, fairly valuing women’s 
important contributions is a particularly important issue to me. 
The gender pay gap is the topic that brings us here today, and the pay gap 
is frequently a focal point in conversations about women’s labor market 
experiences. Although the pay gap can tell us some things about women’s 
experiences at work, we know that—like many metrics—the pay gap has 
substantial limitations. If—as a society—we truly care about supporting and 
1 
 
empowering women, then it is crucial that we understand what those 
limitations are, and what this measure can and cannot tell us. 
For example, although the pay gap indicates that the average man and 
average woman earn different amounts, the headline number does not tell 
us why this is the case. We know that industry, occupation, years of 
experience, educational attainment, geographic location, and family 
decisions all matter greatly for pay. Some of these characteristics vary for 
the average man and average woman and contribute in significant ways to 
the pay gap. 
One of the largest drivers of the pay gap seems to be that men and women 
work in different industries and in different occupations. Caretaking 
responsibilities also play an outsized role—before the birth of their first 
child, women make the same on average as men, but afterwards, working 
mothers’ earnings diverge from working fathers’ earnings, reflecting fewer 
hours worked and other changes. 
Although some of women’s decisions regarding their education, 
occupation, industry, and engagement with the labor force may be 
influenced by cultural pressures and expectations, this does not necessarily 
mean that employers are discriminating on the basis of gender. 
Still, women cannot make as many decisions as they should be able to 
when it comes to their work life. And government policy needs to get out of 
the way and allow employers to provide the flexibility that working mothers 
say they want. 
A path forward lies in policymakers at the federal, state, and local level 
removing the government barriers that currently limit choice and 
opportunity for women. Reforming regulations that get in the way of flexible 
work can greatly increase opportunity—this type of reform would help all 
workers, but especially working women, who surveys indicate prioritize 
flexibility in order to care for their families. 
2 
 
Passing the Working Families Flexibility Act would be a step in the right 
direction to help women and other workers. For decades, federal labor laws 
have unfairly restricted working parents in the private sector from choosing 
either traditional overtime pay or paid time off as compensation for overtime 
hours worked, while granting a special exemption for government 
employees. The Working Families Flexibility Act would correct this disparity 
to give that same opportunity to all working moms and dads. 
In addition to passing the Working Families Flexibility Act, policymakers 
should reform home-based business zoning, which stifles 
entrepreneurship. While home-based businesses have multiplied in recent 
decades—currently making up half of all businesses—many remain 
“underground” since they are illegal under current law. An incredible 17% of 
Black women and 10% of White women are entrepreneurs, and so 
regulatory reform to ease these burdensome rules would be especially 
helpful in clearing the path for their success. 
Occupational licensing laws also constitute a major barrier to work, and 
reform is necessary to eliminate onerous requirements for jobs that can be 
done with little risk to workers and those that they serve. 
 Another area in need of reform is childcare—there are many unnecessary 
regulations that drive up the cost of care. Some laws impose unnecessary 
education requirements on daycare workers or increase staff-to-child ratios, 
making it far more difficult for families to afford care and preventing some 
women from working. Passing the Child Care Worker Opportunity Act 
would help to address this issue for working moms and childcare workers in 
the Washington, D.C. area. 
Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the Pay Check Fairness Act, 
which yesterday the Senate voted not to take up. If we care about women’s 
long-term success, it seems important that we consider the unintentional 
impacts that this bill would likely have, and how it may result in more rigid 
compensation structures that translate into less flexibility in the workplace 
and fewer of the work arrangements that women and many men value. 
3 
 
In addition to reforming regulatory barriers, recent history tells us that 
growth in opportunities for female workers translates to higher wages, new 
jobs, and a narrowing of the pay gap. Just in the years before the 
pandemic, pro-growth policies—like lower taxes and regulatory reforms—
helped sustain a strong labor market for American workers. Women, and 
especially women of color, benefited the most. They experienced some of 
the fastest job growth and largest wage gains on record. 
Rebuilding after the pandemic will be challenging but we know that 
markets, supported by commonsense policies, are the best way to support 
female workers and allow them to build on their decades of progress in the 
workplace. 
As we seek to empower women in the workplace, it is essential that we 
support these pro-growth policies and protect workplace flexibility. I am 
hopeful that today’s hearing will help us better understand how to meet 
women’s and working mother’s needs, and how to develop policies that 
empower them to continue building on their many achievements. 
I look forward to hearing the insights of our witnesses on this important 
topic. 
Thank you.

Alex Tabarrok Testimony, Joint Economic Committee, “Vaccinations and the Economic 
Recovery in 2021.” April 14, 2021 
 
Thank you all for inviting me it’s a pleasure to be here. About a year ago, Nobel Prize winner Michael 
Kremer and I were asked by the Domestic Policy Council of the White House to write a report about 
accelerating vaccines using incentives. Joined by a number of top economists, we advocated for world 
spending on the order of ~$150 billion to invest in approximately 18 vaccine candidates. We wrote 
similar reports for the British government and subsequently came to advise the World Bank and other 
governments and organizations around the world. 
The world did not go as big as we wanted but Operation Warp Speed spent about $15 billion and was 
tremendously successful. 
In a paper in Science we calculate that if we get 3 billion vaccine courses in 2021, which is a conservative 
estimate, that they will be worth $17.4 trillion dollars and OWS should be credited with, certainly not all, 
but a significant faction of that. 
Moreover, it is not too late to do more. We calculate that an additional 1 billion courses of capacity 
available in 2021 would be worth 500 bn to 1 trillion dollars for the world depending on how fast we can 
get that capacity online. 
Is it possible to get more doses this year? Yes. For example, the Biden administration paid Merck $269 
million to upgrade plants to produce the J&J vaccine. That was a smart investment that will pay off not 
just for the US but for the entire world. 
Another smart investment would be to put more money into Nasal and Oral vaccines. The next battle is 
vaccine hesitancy and a lot of vaccine hesitancy is fear of needles. Adults don’t like to say that they are 
afraid of needles but many are. Nasal vaccines, therefore, could do a lot to alleviate vaccine hesitancy 
and nasal vaccines have advantages in uniquely stimulating the mucosal immune system. There are 
nasal vaccines in phase 1 clinical trials and the US could accelerate these with investments in trials and 
manufacturing. 
Once the US is vaccinated, the next job is to vaccinate the world. There are health, economic and 
political reasons to vaccinate the world. 
The unvaccinated are the biggest risk for generating mutations and new variants. You have heard of the 
South Africa and Brazilian variants, well the best way to protect your constituents from these and other 
variants is to vaccine South Africans and Brazilians. 
Moreover, even after the US and other high-income countries are vaccinated the US will continue to 
bear economic costs due to reduced exports, imports and supply-chain disruptions so there are pure 
economic reasons to vaccinate the world. 
The US could significantly advance world vaccination with an additional $4bn support for COVAX. The 
benefits are much bigger the costs (see Agarawal and Reed in attachments). 
Politically we also have a choice, do we want an American Plan to vaccinate the world or a Chinese Plan? 
I would rather have an American plan. 
As we vaccinate the world we should think about ways to stretch doses until scarcity is ended. 
For example, the first Pfizer or Moderna dose protects at about 80% efficacy (see Canadian Statement 
and NEJM letter in attachments). It is better in my view to bring two people from 0% protected to 80% 
protected than to bring one person to 80% and then to 95% protected. Loosely speaking, the first dose 
prevents you from dying, the second dose avoids the sniffles.  
Getting more first doses out sooner will also reduce transmission and get us to herd immunity sooner.  
We should also run trials on fractional dosing, such as half dosing. Fractional dosing has been used 
successfully in previous epidemics. 
Note that half dosing is equivalent to doubling the number of Pfizer and Moderna factories instantly! 
And hence potentially very valuable. Variations are possible such as half-dosing on the second dose. 
Great Britain and Canada have delayed the second dose and other countries will likely follow suit—
stretching doses will be important to vaccinate the world quickly. 
Summing up. 
It is not too late to do more. 
We should invest in nasal vaccines. 
We should vaccinate the world 
We should stretch doses through fractional dosing and delaying the second dose. 
Thank you.

Written Testimony 
 
“Older Workers’ Loss of Bargaining Power Hurts the Economy” 
 
 
Teresa Ghilarducci 
Bernard Schwartz Professor of Economics and Policy Analysis, 
The New School for Social Research 
 
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:  OLDER WORKERS’ LOSS OF BARGAINING POWER HURTS THE ECONOMY 
 
Over 40 million people over the age of 55 work or would like to work but were pushed out of the labor 
force. The sheer scale and fast growth of older workers—45 percent of the 11.9 million jobs expected to 
be added to the economy between 2020 and 2030 will be filled by older workers—requires keen 
attention as the inequality among older workers grows. Some sectors, like home and personal health 
care, use older workers strategically, while others, like technology and finance, shun them. While a 
minority of older workers enjoy fulfilling jobs, most work because they have little retirement savings 
and face lowering wages, increasing job intensity, and being pushed out of the labor force entirely.  
 
•  Older workers are more likely to be working poor than their prime-age counterparts.  
•  Pay and job quality is eroding. 
•  Older workers are becoming a growing source of low-wage labor in large sectors with robust job 
growth, like warehousing, home and personal health care, and janitorial services. All of these 
jobs require bending, stopping, hard physical labor, little training, low pay, and few advancement 
opportunities.  
•  Older workers’ bargaining power has fallen over time and COVID only worsened these pre-
existing trends.  
•  Eroding retirement security is a main reason the bargaining power of older workers is falling. It 
compounds a lack of choice that older workers face and may explain why they will take less and 
less pay to accept a job or change jobs.  
 
If we don’t help older workers improve their bargaining power, younger family members will be pressed 
for time and money to help their impoverished elders while our long-term care system will be populated 
by precariat workers. Economic growth will continue to be impeded on the supply side because we do 
not match workers to jobs and on the demand side because of less spending power in older communities.  
 
     
 
 
 
As older workers make up an increasingly large part of the U.S. labor market, it is long past time that we 
form an Older Workers Bureau (OWB) to hear from older workers and their employers, investigate their 
needs, coordinate the vast resources of the U.S. government, and modernize age discrimination laws and 
worker training. In addition, older workers’ bargaining power would be improved by policies like higher 
Social Security benefits, expanded and improved pensions, increased unionization a higher federal 
minimum wage, enforcing age discrimination laws, and making Medicare first payer.  
 
 
REPORT 
 
I. Trends: A Significant Number of Elders are Becoming a Precariat 
 
In 2021, one quarter of workers in the labor force were 55 or older. Of the 11.9 million jobs expected to 
be added to the economy between 2020 and 2030, 5.3 million, or 45 percent, are projected to be filled by 
older workers. Growth for a subset of that group will be even more dramatic—the ranks of workers ages 
75 and older are projected to shoot up by 97 percent in that timeframe. Just eight years from now, 12 
percent of U.S. workers will be ages 75 or older.  
 
You might imagine a large and growing group of older people who work for joy. But this is only the 
story of a small group of more educated workers who are often in privileged positions and control the 
pace and content of their work—people like think tank economists, university professors, and even 
lawmakers.1 In fact, most older workers work because they have to—they have no fall back retirement 
income security.2  
At the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, 75-year-old Maria Rios makes 
$14.50 an hour as a food prep worker, supplementing her retired husband’s $400 
monthly Social Security check. “I’m forced to still have to work to try to make ends 
meet,” she told The Guardian. 
 
Most people don’t have sufficient savings for an adequate retirement and only a minority of older 
workers have enough money to retire and maintain their living standards or stay out of poverty.3 Only 11 
percent of people ages 62–70 work even though they have enough money to retire, and 10 percent of 
people in this age group are financially secure and retired. Fifty one percent are out of the labor force but 
don’t have enough retirement income, and 28 percent work and don’t have enough money to avoid 
poverty or maintain their standard of living if they retired.4 Over half of those claiming benefits while 
working do so to supplement their low pay—because without a job, they would be below 200 percent of 
the poverty level, living off of just $24,000 a year.5 See Figure 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    2  
 
     
 
 
 
Figure 1 
Who Works at Older Ages and Why?6 
Americans Age 62 – 70 
 
   Retired   Working 
(61%)   (39%) 
Can afford to retire (21%)  10% (Financially secure and   11% (Financially secure and 
retired)  working) 
Cannot afford to retire (79%)  51% (Financially insecure and  28% (Financially insecure and 
retired)  working any job they can get) 
  
 
This means that most people, after a lifetime of hard work and “paying their dues”, can’t count on 
retiring or doing better in the labor market. Job stress, low pay, subordination, and prejudice color the 
reality of many older workers, sets the stage for younger workers’ prospects, and affects the quality of 
the entire American labor market.  
 
Older Workers Are Growing Among the Ranks of the Working Poor 
 
In early 2021, approximately 34 million American workers 55 and older were working full or part time, 
and over one-fifth of them were working poor earning below two-thirds of the U.S. median annual 
hourly wage—which is a bit above $15 per hour. Older women workers are particularly at risk of being 
working poor; 26 percent of older women workers and 16 percent of older men are working poor.  
 
Racial aspects of the working poor 
The risk of being in a low paid job as an older worker is much higher for non-Whites. Non-White and 
Hispanic older workers face a 27 percent chance of being poor, while the risk is 18 percent for an older 
White worker. Older non-White women are at the highest risk of being among working poor.7 
 
Falling Job Quality for Older Workers  
 
Older workers perform more physically taxing work than might be expected, which can negatively 
impact their health  
Nearly 30 percent of workers ages 55–64 are in jobs that require “lots of physical effort” most or all of 
the time. More than 40 percent of Black and Hispanic workers toil in physically demanding jobs, 
compared to less than 30 percent of White workers. Workers without more than a high school degree are 
more than three times as likely as college graduates to perform strenuous jobs.8 See Figure 2.

Note: Sample includes full- and part-time workers 55 to 64. The survey question asks the extent to which a 
respondent’s job requires “lots of physical effort.” Those whose jobs require physical effort “all” or “most” of the time 
are deemed to be in physically demanding jobs. 
 
Many of these types of jobs pay low wages and have few benefits. For example, jobs in personal and 
home healthcare—among the fastest growing occupations and, more importantly, adding the most job 
growth in the next ten years—pay low wages, have few benefits, and are physically difficult. They’re 
also disproportionately filled with older workers. Thirty-one percent of home health and personal care 
workers are 55 or older.9 In an occupation filled with men, a disproportionate share of janitors are 55 or 
older.  
 
The share of older worker fatalities is growing. 
In 2020, a Monthly Labor Review article found that more workplace fatalities are occurring among older 
workers. In one sense this is not surprising, because older workers are a growing share of the labor 
market. What is noteworthy is that some occupations are more dangerous for older workers than others. 
Being self-employed is especially dangerous for older workers, as is being a truck driver or a farmer. 
The largest number of fatal occupational injuries to older workers between 2003 and 2017 occurred 
among farmers and drivers of heavy and tractor-trailer trucks.10 
 
 
Wages and Pay Premiums Are Falling  
 
All workers expect their pay to increase steadily over their time with an employer, a phenomenon 
economists call returns to tenure. But between 1992 and 2015, the effect of an additional year of tenure 
on the hourly wages of older workers fell by 45 percent.11 See Figure 3.

Note:  Sample is restricted to full- and part-time wage and salary workers ages 55 to 64. Returns to tenure are 
calculated as coefficients on a linear regression of log wages on tenure. Control variables include age, age squared, 
gender, race, sex, industry, occupation, and union status. For detailed methodology see Johnson, R. W. (2019). “Older 
Workers and the Declining Rate of Return to Worker Experience.” Generations, 43(3), 63-70. 
 
Wage repression has been more severe for college-educated older men than for college-educated prime-
age men. Between 1990 and 2021, real median hourly wages for full-time male workers 55 and older 
with a high school degree dropped 8.8 percent while wages for the same age group with a bachelor’s 
degree stayed flat. In comparison, the real median hourly wage for prime-age male workers (35–54) 
with a college degree increased 9 percent while prime-age men with a high school degree faced a 15 
percent decrease in their real wages. By contrast, women of all ages did not face declining wages from 
1990 to 2021. Wage trends for men and women differ in part because women are working more and the 
gender wage gap has been shrinking.12 
 
In recent months, wage growth for most workers took off and exceeded pre-pandemic levels. However, 
wage growth for older workers remains below its pre-pandemic peak. The lack of higher wage growth is 
evidence of low demand for older workers’ labor despite historic numbers of job openings and 
demonstrates older workers’ lack of fallback position and bargaining power. See Figure 4.

Wage Growth Since the Pandemic Increased For Everyone But Older Workers

When older workers get rehired, their hourly wages are lower than in their previous job.13 Following a 
job loss, median hourly wages of older workers ages 50–61 are 20 percent lower on the new job than the 
old job, and for workers 62 and older, wages are 27 percent lower on the new job. 
 
Most Older Workers Do Not Have Jobs with 401(k)s or Pensions at Work  
 
Advocates of working longer posit that it will help improve people’s retirement finances, a theory that 
rests on the assumption that older workers continue to save in retirement accounts. In fact my own 
mother at age 67 had to withdraw from her 401(k) to buy a used car to get to work.14 But only 54 
percent of older workers between the ages of 62 and 65 have access to employer-sponsored retirement 
plans and only 49 percent participate in these plans. As older workers age, and in many cases become 
self-employed, it gets worse. Among 66–69-year-old workers, the participation rate falls to 33 percent.15  
 
The evidence is stacked against the notion that working longer into old age boosts retirement security. 
The harsh reality is, most older workers do not have jobs with 401(k)s or pensions—so they must draw 
on Social Security and savings while working, and either tread water or lose ground. And older people 
are taking on more debt than ever before.16

II. Reasons Older Workers Are Losing Bargaining Power 
 
The labor market is a dynamic set of bargaining relationships defined by power. Older people with good 
pensions and high Social Security benefits have power because they can walk away from a bad job or 
bargain for employment terms they want. Most of the others must work even if they want to retire, don’t 
enjoy the work, or are in jobs that make them sicker because they have a weak “fallback” position and 
little bargaining power.  
 
Seniority in the workplace, control over hours and pace of work, and a dignified retirement are benefits 
available only to a privileged upper class of older workers. In reality, many older workers at all earning 
levels are wary of the labor market and readily accept the pay and conditions offered to them. They’re 
also less likely to quit to get a new job.  
 
Workers with Weak Pensions Have Less Bargaining Power  
 
Elders have less bargaining power because eroding retirement income security reduces their fallback 
positions when discussing pay and conditions with employers. Retirement insecurity compounds a lack 
of choice that older workers face and may explain why older workers will take less and less pay to 
accept a job or change jobs.  
 
Less than a quarter of workers have sufficient retirement savings to retire at 62 and maintain their 
standard of living. Even if they work longer, less than half of workers are prepared for retirement at age 
70.17 For the typical older worker, household retirement savings fall far short of adequate. Looking at 
401(k)s and individual retirement accounts—which have become the dominant retirement savings 
vehicles outside of Social Security for most workers—the median working household aged 55–64 has 
retirement savings of $43,000. In the bottom 50 percent of the earnings distribution, the typical 
household’s retirement savings is just $3,000. Even for relatively better-off workers, median balances 
are lower than they should be if living standards are to be maintained in retirement.18 
 
Terry and Nancy Koch of West Allis, Wisconsin once had a retirement account, 
though today they can’t agree as to whether it had $10,000 or $20,000 in it. No 
matter; they cashed it in, paying taxes and the early-withdrawal penalty, and now it’s 
about gone. 
“We never saved a lot of money,” Nancy Koch said, “because there wasn’t any to 
save.” As early as he could — when he turned 62 in 2012 — Terry Koch began taking 
Social Security. There’s a cost to that: his benefit is just under $1,000 a month. 
Nancy Koch has tried to go back to work. “I’m looking, but nobody wants a 70-year-
old,” she told the Washington Post. 
 
 
 
 
 
    7  
 
     
 
 
 
As People Age, They Tend to Get More Desperate about Taking Job Offers, Reducing 
Their Bottom Lines and Decreasing Their Bargaining Power 
 
Older workers are more likely than younger workers to tell researchers they think they can’t find a job 
comparable to their current one, a well-founded fear that persists at every earnings level and reflects the 
reality of an unfriendly labor market.19 For workers 55 or over, 60 percent of men and 70 percent of 
women believe that if they quit their job, they are unlikely to find a comparable job within the next few 
months. See Figure 5. 
Figure 5 
 
Older Workers Worry That They Wouldn’t Find A Comparable Job If They Left Their Current Job 
 
Source: SCEPA calculations using data from the American Life Panel (2013–2016). 
 
In responding to a question asked by the New York Federal Reserve—“What is the lowest wage you 
would be willing to accept before taking a new job?”—workers over the age of 45 give a much lower 
number than do workers under 45. In November 2021, younger workers said they would take a 
minimum of $74,863 to accept a new job while older workers said they would take a new job for 
$65,930, or almost $9,000 less. This difference may make sense in this environment, but when the data 
was first collected in March 2014, there was only a $1,300 difference between the reservation wages of 
older and younger workers, and in November 2016, older workers had a higher reservation wage than 
younger workers.20  
 
Workers Facing Age Discrimination Have Less Bargaining Power  
 
The persistence of age discrimination lowers older workers’ bargaining power. Discrimination based on 
age, ethnicity, race, religion, national origin, or sex is illegal under federal law. Yet older workers are 
prejudged as being less able to work or learn and thus have fewer job offers that pay near their 
productivity. The widespread prejudice towards older workers among U.S. employers reduces their 
bargaining power. Indeed, audit studies—in which employers are confronted with two resumes of 
    8  
 
     
 
 
 
candidates with equal qualifications, but one resume indicates the candidate is older—show that the 
older workers are less likely to be called for an interview.21 
 
Workers Faced More Age Bias During the Pandemic  
 
Older workers experienced unprecedented job loss and unemployment during the pandemic, which 
pushed many out of the labor force and into unplanned early retirement. Increased transitions to 
retirement occurred broadly across demographic groups and were not limited to those 70 years and 
older. We are almost certain that most of the retirements at the low end of the income distribution are 
involuntary because those workers have very little retirement savings and retired only after experiencing 
job loss. 
 
The most important factor predicting retirement in the pandemic was that the older worker was marginal 
in the first place. Three job characteristics were found to be especially important in predicting increased 
pandemic retirement transitions: employment in high-contact occupations and part-time work schedules, 
and low wages. Part-time workers made up an estimated 70 percent of the increase in net year-to-year 
employment-to-retirement transitions during the first year of the pandemic.22 
 
At earlier ages, vulnerable older workers retired sooner. The share of retired workers among adults aged 
55–64 rose 5 percent for those without a college education but fell 4 percent for those with a college 
degree. Black workers without a college degree experienced the highest increase in the share who are 
retired before age 65. This rate rose 1.5 percentage points, from 16.4 percent to 17.9 percent between 
2019 and 2021.  
 
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in November 2021, the average expected 
likelihood of working beyond age 62 declined to 49.3 percent, a new series low, from 50.1 percent in 
July. The average expected likelihood of working beyond age 67 also declined to a new series low of 
31.1 percent, from 32.4 percent in July.23 At the same time, reservation wages—or the lowest wage 
workers would be willing to accept for a new job—has begun to diverge for older workers, a concerning 
development.24  
 
 
Workers With Weak Pensions And Low Pay Claim Social Security While Working, 
Forgoing Higher Benefits  
 
Older workers with low pay often claim Social Security early, which lowers their lifetime Social 
Security benefits. Reduced benefits weaken their fallback position, which in turn lowers their bargaining 
power. More than half of workers ages 62 or older claim Social Security benefits while working. 
Though workers who are financially unprepared for retirement are often advised to work longer, 
research shows that the effect of work at older ages on financial preparedness for retirement has been far 
smaller than predicted. Since most older workers combine work with Social Security benefit receipt, 
they forego the Delayed Retirement Credit. Older workers need to earn enough to be able to save for 
retirement and live without claiming benefits.25  
 
I am not accusing early claimers of making a non-financially literate mistake. It is the sensible thing to 
do for those with few assets and whose earnings fall short of the income they would receive if they 
    9  
 
     
 
 
 
retired. Three quarters of workers with labor market earnings that are lower than the retirement income 
they would receive have less than $20,000 financial wealth and have little choice but to tap Social 
Security to smooth consumption.  
 
Workers are caught in a cycle that reduces their choices and erodes bargaining power. 
 
 
III. The Negative Consequences of the Growth of Elder Labor with Low Bargaining Power 
 
Young people in families with fragile elders are hurt when retirement security is weak. So too is an 
economy in which jobs and workers aren't well matched and after a long career of hard work there is no 
well-ordered off-ramp to retirement. About the only sectors that aren’t negatively affected are those 
growing sectors whose business models depend on low-wage labor. On the aggregate demand side, these 
issues lead to less spending power in older communities.   
 
Profitable Sectors Depend on Low Paid Elders and Inadequate Pensions  
 
Older workers have been an important source of low-wage labor in large sectors with robust growth. 
Let's drill down on a few of the industries that are adding the most jobs over the coming years. In the 
home health and personal care sector, 56 percent of workers earn poverty wages and 31 percent of 
them—much higher than the national average of 23 percent—are workers 55 or older. What is shocking 
is that this sector is adding almost 10 percent (1.3 million) of the new jobs in the next eight years. Most 
of these workers are older women. Janitors and cleaners, the vast majority whom are older men, 
represent another fast-growing and low-wage occupation. Median annual earnings in that sector is 
$47,000, so 48 percent of workers in that sector are working poor. It is also among the oldest 
occupations, with 34 percent of workers 55 or older. 
 
The size and growth of the older workforce diminishes the pressure on employers in these sectors to 
improve jobs and subsidizes firms and industries with low productivity by providing them with cheap 
labor. It also comes at a cost to the overall economy, since with better policies, these workers could be 
employed in more productive sectors. See Figure 6.

Negative Impacts of Low Paid Elders and Inadequate Pensions on Younger Generations  
 
Policies that support the financial independence of older adults are also a direct help to the younger 
adults who support them. In the U.S., 30 percent of adults with at least one parent ages 65 or older say 
their aging parent or parents need help handling affairs or caring for themselves. Non-White households 
are more likely to provide support to aging parents. Older Americans in middle- and lower-
socioeconomic classes are disproportionately likely to rely upon the financial, time and emotional 
support of younger generations. Lower-income adults who provide care to an older adult also are least 
likely to be working full-time while providing that care. They are also less likely to have access to 
flexible working hours, time off, or paid leave to accommodate the time challenges of caring for an 
older relative.27 See Figure 7.

Brett Carneiro, 37, a father of a 7-year-old son, a 5-year-old-daughter and a 9-month-
old boy in Durham, N.H., said that he stayed self-employed as a digital marketing 
consultant in part because there was no way he could have cared for his children and 
his parents while keeping down a traditional job. “I would have had to resign,” he said. 
Working for himself was “the only way to control the money-making part of my life 
without being terminated.” He felt that he missed out on career advancement and 
made financial sacrifices to meet his parents’ needs, per the New York Times. 
 
 
Negative Impacts of Low Paid Elders and Inadequate Pensions on Communities and 
Neighborhoods  
 
Ever since the World Health Organization launched its campaign for Global Age-friendly Cities in 2005, 
mayors get celebrated when they make their cities “age-friendly.” 28,29 However, since inequalities in 
aging and retirement wealth create a “tale of two retirements” in America, even the most warm-hearted 
and progressive politician knows at some level that a rich elder is better for their district’s fiscal position 
than a lower income elder.  
 
Tempe, Arizona, welcomes elders of financial means to live near the vibrant Arizona State University 
campus at the Mirabella complex where the “buy-in” fee starts at over $370,000 and fees are over 
$4,000 a month.30 These elders are a net positive—in a purely fiscal sense—to the city’s budget and the 
regional economy. But these sorts of higher-income elder communities are the exception rather than the 
rule. 
 
The conventional “pension expenditure multipliers”—estimating how much $1 of pension spending 
generates—is a bit over $2.31 The multiplier means that paying a public employee $1 in pension 
payments multiplies to about $2 as the pensioner goes to the corner grocery store, pays the rent to their 
local landlord, and tips the worker who mows their lawn. This money reverberates through the local 
economy, increasing overall economic activity. Since retirement income, especially retirement income 
from Social Security and pension plans, is mostly unaffected by economic fluctuations and recessions, it 
can act as a stabilizer for local economies during periods of high unemployment.32  
 
This isn’t the only contribution of the retirement system to national and local economies. The “taxpayer 
investment factor,” devised by the National Institute for Retirement Security, measures the positive 
effects of retirement savings and the potential investment funded by these savings in boosting 
productivity, creating jobs, and expanding aggregate demand by generating investment income. This 
measure, more relevant to taxpayers, yields a whopping $8 to the economy for every dollar of pension 
contribution, mainly from compounding interest. This concept is worth lingering on.33  
 
On the flip side of the coin, another approach tallies all the direct costs to states and localities of aiding 
poor seniors in need. A community with a fragile elder population is a community that has hefty 
demands on its public revenues and tax dollars for elder housing and food programs. If a town or city 
picks up Medicaid costs like New York City does, then the Medicaid burden affects the entire 
community. In some states, up to one-third of the budget goes to cover Medicaid.34 Much of that goes to 
    12  
 
     
 
 
 
middle-class seniors who became poor while stuck in exorbitant nursing homes, or to those who don’t 
qualify for Medicare, or to those who are so poor they are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.  
 
Several studies have investigated the costs of insufficient retirement security on state budgets. In Utah, 
for example, nearly 10 percent of the newly retired qualify for more than $2,500 a year in direct 
government assistance, mostly because of inadequate pension income.35  The total cost to Utah’s 
taxpayers for new retirees will top $3.7 billion over the next 15 years—and 73 percent of these costs will 
be spent on one-third of the retiring population, amounting to two percent of the state’s annual budget. 
Looked at another way, if the bottom third of Utah’s elderly got a 10 percent increase in net worth, the 
state’s taxpayers would save millions through 2030.  
 
A study of New Jersey seniors by the AARP  found that between 2013 and 2030, a host of costs—
including Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance 
Program (SNAP), and expenses for state programs like the Property Tax Reimbursement Program and 
the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program—would increase by between $7.2 and $10 billion 
due to elder poverty.  
 
The lesson here is that if we can keep elders out of poverty and near-poverty, the fiscal burden from the 
retirement-age population falls. The opposite is true, too: well-off elderly people can help a community.  
 
Negative Impacts of Low Paid Elders And Inadequate Pensions on Productivity  
 
Older workers can be highly productive, especially if they want to keep working. They are experienced, 
knowledgeable, and committed to their jobs. However, their experience is often undervalued and not 
utilized where it could be most productive. Age discrimination is a factor in the declining rewards for 
experience. So too is an older worker’s declining value to employers who do not invest in training and 
retaining employees. While all older workers are exposed to the risks created by these practices, low 
earning older workers with less job security are more exposed to these risks. Owen Davis, a PhD student 
at The New School and a member of my research lab, also found that during the COVID-19 recession, 
those with lower earning levels were much more likely to lose their jobs and retire involuntarily after a 
period of unemployment.  
 
As previously discussed, older workers whose experiences and skills are undervalued but cannot afford 
to retire are often pushed to low-productivity and physically demanding jobs and claim Social Security 
early while still working to supplement their low wages. This process subsidizes firms and industries 
with low productivity by providing them with cheap labor. However, this is also a net loss for the 
economy, since with better policies, these workers could be employed in more productive sectors. 
 
Economist Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution found that between 1985 and 2010—and 
particularly in the 1980s—older workers with less education tended to retire earlier than those with more 
education, and that was good for the economy, at least as he measured it.36 His argument is strictly about 
average productivity, which he measured based on wages. In the time period Burtless studied, the less 
educated and least productive retirees were more likely to have defined benefit plans which allowed 
their earlier retirement at more stable incomes. I agree with Burtless on the general point—if low–
income elders in, say, retail drop out, and high-income professors stay working, then overall 
productivity is higher. But, at The New School, we concluded that this was hard on the least educated 
    13  
 
     
 
 
 
and created more gaps between the haves and the have nots. After all, less-educated workers tend to get 
paid less, accumulate less savings, and get worse (if any) pensions, so for them retiring early isn’t 
necessarily the boon it may seem to be. 
 
Another consideration, though more difficult to calculate, is that workforce morale and productivity may 
drop if less-educated older people work longer out of financial necessity.37 In 2010, University of 
Toronto, Prof. Heather Scott-Marshall found that work-related insecurity negatively affected all 
workers’ health, but that the effects were greater at older ages and for those with visible minority group 
status.38  
 
These negative effects on productivity are essential because productivity is the golden goose of any 
economy. When productivity increases, the economy can produce more with the same resources or 
produce the same with fewer resources. That means more opportunities and makes every public budget 
priority more affordable.  
 
IV. Policy Recommendations: Older Workers Bureau and Raising Bargaining Power  
 
Several policies would strengthen bargaining power among all older workers by helping older workers 
negotiate better pay and working conditions. Negotiators whose cost of “walking away” from the 
bargaining table are lower are in stronger positions. 
 
1.  An Older Workers Bureau  
 
As older workers make up an increasingly large part of the U.S. labor market, it is long past time that we 
form an Older Workers Bureau (OWB) to hear from older workers and their employers, investigate their 
needs, coordinate the vast resources of the U.S. government, and modernize age discrimination laws and 
worker training.  
 
An effective OWB fulfills three functions:  
 
•  identify and analyze issues of concern for older workers,  
•  devise innovative policies to address these issues  
•  engage in outreach and education.  
 
That last point is crucial: the OWB should play an empowerment role. One of the major issues facing 
older workers is age discrimination. As a recent AARP study found, about a quarter of older workers 
who are underemployed (for reasons other than health and family) cite age discrimination as a reason. 
Yet many older workers lack awareness of their rights regarding discrimination. Another recent AARP 
study found that while most older workers know age discrimination is illegal, shockingly few know the 
law applies to them.  
 
A related problem is that of worker training. Training programs often avoid older workers because they 
are more difficult to place, and training programs want to be evaluated favorably. Research shows older 
workers face barriers to entering retraining programs. An OWB could help empower older workers and 
rationalize the transition to full and partial retirement. No government body currently plays this role.

2.  Improved Retirement Security  
 
Older workers’ bargaining power would be improved by policies like higher Social Security benefits and 
expanded and improved pensions. In particular, we need a universal pension system. I have worked for 
over 35 years to expand pensions for all workers. My most recent proposal, a bipartisan proposal 
coauthored with former President Trump’s Council of Economic Advisors economist Kevin Hassett, 
presents a scaled-down version of a plan that I developed with private equity fund executive Tony 
James. 
 
TSP for MOST, the recent Hassett and Ghilarducci proposal, explores the potential wealth-building 
effects of giving disadvantaged workers access to a program modeled after the highly successful federal 
Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), which is currently available only to federal workers and members of the 
military. The TSP is a highly successful and closely studied program that features automatic enrollment 
for eligible workers, very low fee ratios, simple plan options, and matching federal contributions. 
Making such a program broadly available to workers who lack access to an employer sponsored plan 
would dramatically improve the ability of lower-income workers to build assets over the course of their 
careers, thereby ensuring a more secure retirement and the ability to pass on wealth to future 
generations. What’s more, it could be achieved at relatively little cost to the federal government while 
protecting Social Security and avoiding new financial burdens on small businesses.  
 
The pandemic and recession shattered open already growing gaps in economic opportunity. As the 
country rebuilds, we need new ideas to build wealth and financial security for working families. My 
coauthor and I agree that our collective future is better if we diminish wealth disparities. Our proposal 
would set more American families up for financial independence and help build intergenerational 
wealth.”39 
 
3.  Raise Compensation  
 
Raise the minimum wage  
The federal minimum wage is extremely low. It is therefore unsurprising that 20 percent of American 
workers earn poverty wages, and that 26 percent of older women workers are poor.  
 
According to a Brookings Institution report by Beth Truesdale, “In addition to making paid work more 
attractive and more stable for middle-aged and older workers, raising the minimum wage would have 
positive effects on Social Security’s long-term finances as well as on individuals’ Social Security 
benefits, thus improving retirement income for many lower-income retirees who depend entirely or 
almost entirely on Social Security.”40  
 
Unionization  
One of the most effective ways to improve older workers’ pay, conditions and retirement options is to 
expand unions. Across the board, unionization substantially improves workers’ access to, coverage in, 
and use of healthcare plans. Greater access to higher quality healthcare—a typical characteristic of 
unionized work—is especially important for older workers, for whom the prevention and treatment of 
chronic illnesses is critical. In addition, union safety values influence safety outcomes at workplace.41  
 
    15  
 
     
 
 
 
What’s more, research shows that unionized employees earn far more than their non-unionized 
counterparts, on average and provide important workplace protections. As a 2020 Brookings 
Institution report by Beth Truesdale of Harvard University explained, “In the absence of meaningful 
union representation, very low wages are deeply baked into the structure of many industries. … the 
decline of unions and the political erosion of worker protections during the past 40 years have produced 
a situation in which there are few checks on employers’ wage-setting power.”42 In another Brookings 
report that year, Seth Harris of Cornell University found that low union density can “deprive some older 
workers of important workplace protections against age discrimination.”43  
 
4.  Enforce Age Discrimination Laws 
 
Stricter anti-discrimination laws are necessary to help older workers find employment. Research has 
proven the effectiveness of anti-discrimination laws at both federal and state levels in combating age 
discrimination and increasing employment of older workers. However, a 2009 decision by the U.S. 
Supreme Court reduced the effectiveness of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), the 
federal act that protects against age discrimination. The ruling increased the worker’s burden of proof by 
requiring the worker to show that age was not just one of the factors the employer considered, but the 
deciding factor leading to the employer’s discriminatory decision. Congress could fix the ADEA and 
make any discrimination motivated by age illegal. 
 
5.  Make Medicare First Payer 
 
One of the biggest potential barriers to hiring older workers is the cost of providing health insurance. To 
alleviate this pressure, Medicare should be made first-payer, covering medical expenses before private 
insurance, to lower firms’ costs of providing older workers with health insurance. Easing the burden of 
hiring older workers would help prevent involuntary retirements while increasing older workers’ health 
coverage.  
 
 
IV. Policy Don’ts 
 
Don’t Raise The Retirement Age  
In the United States, access to time in retirement is unequally distributed.44 Increasing the Social 
Security Full Retirement Age (FRA) adversely affects all workers because an increase is equivalent to 
an across-the-board cut in benefits. Raising the FRA leaves workers with two bad choices: working 
longer or living on reduced monthly benefits for the rest of their lives. Working longer further penalizes 
Black workers and low-wage workers who are unlikely to be able to work until FRA because of health 
issues.45 Even if they can stay employed, these workers are less likely to live long enough to recoup 
payments foregone as a result of delayed claiming due to inequality in longevity. Instead of cutting 
Social Security benefits, policy makers should update and modernize the 401(k) and IRA systems to 
provide workers with better options.46 
 
 
 
 
    16  
 
     
 
 
 
Healthy Retirement Time Is Becoming More Unequal  
We could have equal retirement time if the people who die early get to retire sooner. But they don’t. 
People who die early are having to work more. 
As a rule of thumb, those in higher socio-economic classes work longer but their superior longevity 
gives them more retirement time. On the flip side Blacks workers, in comparison to White Workers with 
the same levels of education, are forced out of the labor force early. But their earlier retirement ages do 
not make up for their lower and falling life expectancy, so they get spend LESS time in retirement. 
Despite progress in racial and class disparities, race and class -based longevity gaps have grown over the 
past half century.47 In the past 20 years, all of our longevity gains as a society went to those in the upper 
half of the income distribution.48 The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing social 
inequalities and made the race-based longevity gap worse. 49 
Though women have more retirement time than men, they spend a larger proportion of their retirement 
sick or impaired—26 percent compared to 23 percent. Notably, Black women spend 38 percent of their 
retirement disabled while men and women with high economic status spend only 20 percent of their 
retirement disabled. Forcing elders to work to make up for eroding pensions could increase class- and 
race-based retirement quality gaps.  
 
In a parallel reality to who gets to retire, we ask—who doesn’t get to retire, ever? Who works until they 
drop? Working longer and living shorter gives men a higher risk of not spending any time in retirement. 
Strictly on gender lines, 14 percent of men die without ever retiring, while nine percent of women meet 
this grim fate. 
 
Equalizing healthy retirement times was an achievement Americans forgot to celebrate. The practical 
ability and social right to retire is becoming more contingent on whether a person is disabled or has 
saved enough. No one else, it seems, is deserving. One of the signature achievements of the post-WWII 
period—the democratization of who has control over the pace and content of their time after a lifetime 
of work—is being reversed.  
 
Making Americans work longer is especially harsh given that men and women in the U.S. already work 
more hours per day, more days per year, and more years per lifetime than their counterparts in any G7 
nation.  
 
Don’t Allow Premature Withdrawals 
 
Another policy error is to incentivize workers to drain their retirement accounts during economic 
shocks. This was the policy of the 2020 CARES Act, which eliminated penalties for 401(k) withdrawals 
at the start of the pandemic. But allowing withdrawals from retirement accounts in case of emergencies 
rather than providing support to those affected by economic crisis and natural disasters will only require 
vulnerable workers to choose between suffering today or experiencing downward mobility and poverty 
in retirement. It increases inequality in retirement because low-income workers with no emergency 
savings or liquid assets are more likely to tap into their retirement savings when facing economic 
shocks.50 Conversely, proposals to allow rainy-day funds may help reduce inequality.51

31 None of these multiplier studies are academically peer-reviewed and the data, methods, baseline assumptions 
and questions vary widely. Nor are the models dynamic. Studies taking the positive approach estimate the 
multiplier effects of pension benefits using a regional economic modeling software called IMPLAN. These 
studies require assumptions regarding the composition of spending by pension beneficiaries, among other inputs. 
The results reflect direct, indirect, and induced effects of this spending (e.g., the purchases made by retirees, the 
jobs supported by these purchases, and the spending that comes out of these jobs).

47 In 1950, life expectancy for Black and white men at age 65 was equal, about 12.8 years. Now there is a two-
year difference in longevity for older men by race, and their probability of even surviving to age 65 is widely 
disparate. While 81 percent of white men make it to age 65, just 70 percent of Black men do.

8. 
49 After the ravages of 2020, life expectancy in the U.S. was projected to fall by 1.13 years49—but 
declines for Black and Latino people are three to four times higher than for whites. University of Southern 
California researchers found, “Consequently, COVID-19 is expected to reverse over 10 years of progress made in 
closing the Black-White gap in life expectancy and reduce the previous Latino mortality advantage by over 70%.” 
49 Once a person makes it to age 52, women in the highest education category live the longest at 84.4 years while 
men in the bottom education category live six years less at 75.9 years. (See Table 4.2 for more on this.) But high-
income men live longer than low-income women! We shouldn’t overestimate the role of gender in determining 
life expectancy—class matters a lot. In a 2015 study49 retirement time for the highest educated man was found to 
be 20 percent higher than for men with the least education.  Being Black is associated with many cumulative 
disadvantages over a lifetime——receiving lower pay, having a greater chance of living in poverty and in poor 
neighborhoods, and experiencing a lifetime of macro- and micro-aggression—race on its own does not produce a 
statistically significant effect on retirement duration when we control for socio-economic status and pension plan 
type. Black Americans can only get as much retirement time as whites with the same socio-economic status if they 
are able to retire early to make up for shorter life expectancies.

U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee Hearing: Building a Better Labor Market: Empowering Older 
Workers for a Stronger Economy 
Monique Morrissey 
Institute Economist 
Economic Policy Institute 
 
February 9, 2022 
Thank you, Chairman Beyer, Ranking Member Lee, and the distinguished members of the committee for 
inviting me to participate in this hearing. My name is Monique Morrissey and I am an economist at the 
Economic Policy Institute (EPI) in Washington, D.C. EPI is a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank created in 
1986 to include the needs of low- and middle-wage workers in economic policy discussions. EPI 
conducts research and analysis on the economic status of working America, proposes public policies that 
protect and improve the economic conditions of low- and middle-wage workers, and assesses policies 
with respect to how well they further those goals.  
My testimony addresses the following questions:  
•  How has the pandemic impacted older workers? What are some of the labor market exit and re-
entry trends for older workers that we have observed over the past two years?  How have they 
differed from pre-pandemic trends? 
•  What has the pandemic revealed as key gaps in the protections that older worker have in the 
labor market? What policies would improve the labor market experience of older workers? 
•  How has the experience of the pandemic differed among older workers, if we were to group 
them by age, sex, race, occupation, or socioeconomic status?  
An atypical recession and recovery 
The pandemic recession was unusual. Unlike most, it was not triggered by a financial crisis causing a 
drop in aggregate demand. Homeowners and 401(k) participants benefited from rising asset values, 
notwithstanding the recent drop in stock prices. The recession officially lasted two months in early 2020 
before the economy rebounded, though employment remains nearly 3 million below the pre-pandemic 
peak—or 4.5 million factoring in population growth. 
Labor supply and demand were both affected by social distancing in response to the pandemic. 
Layoffs were concentrated in services such as leisure and hospitality, while health and safety concerns 
and caregiving responsibilities loomed large in workers’ decisions to leave the workforce.  
Fear of contracting COVID—and workers actually contracting COVID—remain the biggest impediments 
to a full recovery. The omicron variant caused a record spike in the number of workers sidelined by 
illness in January—3.6 million in total (BLS 2022a)—a fact obscured by revisions to earlier employment 
estimates that resulted in strong reported employment growth for January. Though employment has 
undoubtedly grown rapidly over the past year, the timing of these gains was significantly revised in the 
January jobs report (BLS 2022b).1 The omicron variant also caused 6.0 million workers to be sidelined in 
January because their employer lost business or closed. Though infection rates are declining from their 
January peak, protecting workers from COVID with strong occupational safety and health standards 
remains an urgent priority for workers, their families, and the broader economy. 
Female-dominated service occupations, including care work, saw large initial job losses. This is in 
contrast to typical recessions, where male-dominated durable goods manufacturing and construction 
are among the hardest hit as consumers and investors lose confidence and delay major purchases and 
investments.  
As demand for goods has remained high in the pandemic while demand for services has suffered, 
global supply chain bottlenecks have reduced the supply of certain goods, driving up prices in the U.S. 
and other countries. While some workers are seeing overdue wage gains, there is no evidence of a 
wage-price spiral, as wage gains are concentrated in certain service industries, such as hospitality, while 
price inflation is concentrated in certain goods-producing industries, such as automobiles (Bivens 2021; 
Politano 2021).  
The “Great Resignation” has received much attention, but so far appears to have mostly benefited 
younger, more mobile, workers. The Federal Reserve of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker, which tracks 
individual workers’ annual wage growth to strip out the effect of changes in the composition of the 
workforce, shows that only workers ages 16-24 have seen accelerated wage gains in the pandemic, 
while wages for workers ages 55 and older decelerated during much of the pandemic and continue to 
grow much more slowly than wages of prime-age (25-54) or younger (16-24) workers. 
In the recession, workers ages 55 and older saw employment declines (-15.0%) similar to those for 
prime-age workers ages 25-64 (-14.4%). In most recessions, including the Great Recession, older 
workers are less likely than younger and prime-age workers to lose their jobs due to seniority. The 
unusually high employment decline for older workers in the pandemic happened even though older 
workers were less likely to be in occupations and industries most affected by the pandemic, such as 
leisure and hospitality. However, older workers face much greater health risks from COVID, so declines 
in employment for older workers were steeper in occupations characterized by high physical proximity 
to others (Davis 2021). 
The robust federal response to the recession was also atypical. Adequate fiscal support, including relief 
checks and expanded unemployment benefits, brought about a strong and rapid recovery despite the 
pandemic’s persistence and global supply chain issues. This stands in sharp contrast to the slow recovery 
                                                             
1 Revisions to employment estimates were due in part to adjusting population controls to reflect 900,000 COVID 
deaths, of which the vast majority—roughly 800,000—were ages 55 and older. The U.S. Census Bureau resets 
population controls once a year in January, which in turn affects employment estimates based on employment 
rates for different age groups. Other survey-related challenges, including ambiguity in how workers sidelined by 
COVID are coded and higher non-response rates, have added to the noisiness of employment estimates during the 
pandemic.  
after the Great Recession, which caused lasting damage to vulnerable workers and their families, 
including many older workers. As a result of actions taken to shore up household finances and expand 
unemployment eligibility and benefits, low-wage workers were less likely to experience large income 
losses during the pandemic recession than before the pandemic (Larrimore, Mortenson, and Splinter 
2021). However, most relief measures have ended and vulnerable workers, including unemployed older 
workers, face greater challenges ahead. 
Employment rates for some age groups, but not older workers, are now approaching pre-pandemic 
rates. Employment rebounded more quickly among younger (16-24) and prime age (25-54) workers 
than older workers (55+), so older workers account for a disproportionate share of the remaining jobs 
gap. Older workers (55+) were 24% of the workforce in November and December of 2019 but accounted 
for 41% of missing jobs in November 2021 and 35% in December 2021 based on age-adjusted 
employment projections. Put another way, over 1 million of the 3 million workers “missing” in 
December according to this conservative estimate2 are older workers. Including hard-hit middle-aged 
workers aged 50-54 would show employment losses skewing even more toward older workers. (Unless 
otherwise noted, statistics are based on my analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Survey 
microdata (IPUMS-CPS).)  
Which older workers were most affected? 
Among older workers, women, non-college workers, workers of color, and part-time workers were 
more likely to lose their jobs or quit during the pandemic recession. Among workers ages 55 and older, 
employment in the recession fell by -12% for men versus -16% for women; by -28% for part-time 
workers versus -9% for full-time workers; by -17% for workers without bachelor’s degrees versus -8% for 
those with bachelor’s degrees; and by -15% for non-Hispanic Black workers, -17% for Hispanic workers, 
and -21% for Asian/other workers versus -12% for non-Hispanic white workers.  
With some exceptions, vulnerable groups are still lagging behind. Despite a strong rebound in 
employment after April 2020, employment in December 2021 was further behind pre-pandemic levels 
for older women (-3%) than for older men (-1%); and for older Black non-Hispanic workers (-6%) than for 
older white non-Hispanic workers (-3%). However, employment of older Hispanic workers was slightly 
above pre-pandemic levels (+2%), and employment of older Asian/other workers was unchanged (0%). 
Employment of older workers without bachelor’s degrees remained significantly below pre-pandemic 
levels (-5%), while that of older workers with bachelor’s degrees slightly increased (+2%). These 
                                                             
2 This is a conservative estimate because it ignores an upward trend in labor force participation by older workers 
and simply assumes age-adjusted employment rates would have been the same in 2021 as in 2019 absent the 
pandemic. Age adjustment is based on five-year age groups except for the youngest (ages 16-24) and oldest (ages 
75+) groups. An important caveat is that population estimates in 2021 CPS data were not adjusted for high COVID 
mortality among older age groups. Adjustments were made in January, but January microdata is not yet publicly 
available. 
estimates do not account for changes in population size that vary by group nor for seasonal variations, 
though patterns appeared broadly similar in November.3  
Part-time work accounts for most of the employment loss among older workers. Among older 
workers, part-time employment remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels in December (-8%), 
while full-time employment appeared essentially unchanged (0%). Though these measures are sensitive 
to seasonal and demographic changes, especially as the large Baby Boomer cohort aged into older ages 
where part-time work is more common, there is little doubt that part-time work accounts for most of 
the employment loss among older workers, especially those age 65 and older. Davis (2021) for example, 
estimated that part-time workers accounted for 70% of the increase in retirements in the first year of 
the pandemic.   
Middle-aged workers ages 55 to 64 and workers ages 65 and older experienced the pandemic 
differently. Estimates for smaller sub-groups can be noisy and hard to pin down. However, it is clear that 
declines among the oldest subgroup, workers 65 years and older, account for most of the persistent 
employment losses. The oldest workers who left were more likely to be highly educated than their 
middle-aged counterparts and better prepared for retirement. Among middle-aged workers ages 55 to 
64 who left the workforce, the most concerning are declines among workers without bachelor’s degrees 
(-6%) and Black non-Hispanic workers (-8%), since these workers are less likely to be able to retire early 
without experiencing hardship. Research on older workers who left the workforce in the first year of the 
pandemic also found significant differences by age and income sub-groups, with retirements 
concentrated among workers ages 70 and older, especially higher-income workers, while employment 
losses among middle-aged workers skewing toward lower-income workers (Davis 2021; Quinby, 
Rutledge and Wettstein 2021).  
Unemployed older workers 
Despite important differences with previous recessions, one usual pattern has held true: older 
workers who lost their jobs in the pandemic were likely to stay unemployed longer than their younger 
counterparts. In December 2021, 43% of unemployed older workers (ages 55+) were unemployed for 6 
months or more compared with 30% of their younger counterparts (ages 16-54) (Schramm 2021). 
Older workers who lose their jobs face greater earnings losses than their younger counterparts. These 
earnings losses stem from longer unemployment duration and the fact that new jobs for unemployed 
older workers often pay significantly less than their old ones due to the loss of employer-specific skills 
and age discrimination (Johnson and Gosselin 2018).  
Age discrimination in hiring is rampant. A study published by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 
found that employers were less likely to contact older fictitious job applicants (ages 64-66) than their 
                                                             
3 Comparing employment-to-population rates is usually preferable to comparing employment levels, but the 
impact of COVID deaths on older populations may not be accurately reflected in 2021 CPS data. Population 
controls were adjusted in January 2022 to reflect COVID deaths, but these annual adjustments are not applied 
retroactively. 
middle-aged (49-51) or young (29-31) counterparts. Age discrimination was worse for women and 
unrelated to the physical demands of the job, as older women received roughly half as many callbacks 
for administrative positions as young women (Neumark, Burn, and Button 2017). Earlier studies have 
found similar results (see, for example, Lahey 2007). 
A multi-faceted approach is needed to combat discrimination. Better enforcement of the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act is necessary but not sufficient given the difficulty job applicants have 
in demonstrating that they were rejected for age-related reasons. Protections against wrongful 
termination may even discourage some employers from hiring older workers in the first place (Lahey 
2006). An Older Workers Bureau at the Department of Labor could be particularly useful in combating 
age discrimination in hiring based on mistaken assumptions about older job applicants, such as assuming 
that they are likely to retire soon. 
Older unemployed workers especially benefited from measures taken during the pandemic to extend 
the duration of unemployment benefits, increase benefit amounts, and expand eligibility to workers 
who normally fall through cracks in the system. These temporary measures not only assisted vulnerable 
jobless workers and their families, they also helped the economy recover quickly (Bivens and Banerjee 
2021). Despite federal aid, however, some states ended extended unemployment insurance (UI) early in 
response to unfounded complaints that generous unemployment benefits impeded employment growth 
(Dube 2021; Martinez Hickey and Cooper 2021; CBPP 2022). Before enactment of these temporary 
measures, 3 in 10 jobless workers did not meet states’ strict and outdated eligibility requirements, 
including many part-time workers and workers misclassified as contractors. Income replacement rates in 
many states are also abysmally low, another reason we need comprehensive UI reform (Bivens et al. 
2021).  
Extended benefits also help workers and the economy by improving job matching. Exploring 
differences in UI eligibility by state during the Great Recession, Farooq, Kugler and Muratori (2020) 
found that extended UI benefits allowed jobless workers to find higher-paying jobs that better matched 
their skills and training. The economy benefits when workers are matched to jobs that employ their skills 
rather than being forced to take the first available job. Low-road employers who are competitive only 
because they pay low wages and provide few benefits are enabled by workers’ inertia and poor 
knowledge of better options (Jäger et al. 2021).  
Work sharing holds promise as an alternative to traditional unemployment benefits. Work sharing, 
also known as short-term compensation, encourages employers to reduce hours rather than lay off 
workers during recessions by providing benefits to compensate workers for lost wages (Herzenberg 
2020). Though some states already had work sharing programs in place before the pandemic and 
temporary funding for work sharing was included in the CARES Act, many employers were not aware of 
this option, which has been successful in reducing layoffs in countries like Belgium and Germany. 
Maintaining employment relationships is especially important for older workers who face daunting 
challenges in being rehired after layoffs. 
How concerned should we be about pandemic retirements? 
Some excess retirements are less concerning than others. The impact on workers and their families 
depends on whether they are being pulled into retirement by rising net worth or pushed out of the 
workforce by layoffs or due to health and safety concerns. Davis (2021) found that excess pandemic 
retirements among 65- to 74-year-olds were concentrated among college-educated white workers who 
are likely better prepared than average for retirement, especially given gains in stock and housing 
values. On the other hand, employment declines among middle-aged workers ages 55 to 64 with lower 
earnings and less formal education are more concerning because these workers are not likely to be 
ready for retirement and are not yet eligible for Medicare and other benefits.  
Many seniors who left the workforce were already semi-retired. Their decision to exit could reflect 
rising net worth, health and safety concerns, pandemic disruptions, or all the above. A semi-retired 70-
year-old accountant with a few small business clients, for example, may have seen his 401(k) grow, his 
client list shrink, and his job made riskier by the pandemic. Many new retirees in the oldest age groups 
were likely receiving retirement benefits when they were working, partly explaining why we have not 
seen a parallel rise in Social Security take-up. 
Other factors that could explain a puzzling dip in Social Security applications may include relief 
payments and expanded unemployment benefits keeping unemployed older workers in the labor 
force, and the effect of Social Security office closings. While Social Security office closings during the 
pandemic have undoubtedly affected take-up of disability benefits (Stein and Weaver 2021), a lifeline 
for workers in poor health, the impact of office closings on applications for retirement benefits is less 
clear. Anecdotal evidence suggests that office staff often encourage people to apply for retirement 
benefits even when it could be in their interest to delay and receive higher monthly payments. Applying 
online may make it more likely that would-be applicants encounter advice from AARP, the National 
Academy of Social Insurance, and other organizations encouraging seniors to consider delaying. 
Even in the case of workers who exit the workforce for reasons unrelated to rising asset prices, it does 
not necessarily follow that we should try to lure them back—at least not until we solve the problems 
that caused them to leave in the first place. Many left the paid workforce due to health issues or 
caregiving responsibilities. A Brookings study estimated that 1.6 million full-time-equivalent workers 
might be missing from the workforce due to lingering COVID effects (Bach 2022), which could account 
for a third or more of missing jobs.  
Many sidelined workers, especially women, are caring for family members suffering from pandemic-
related health problems and making up for staffing shortages among paid caregivers. Pandemic-
related problems include patients with health issues other than COVID who delayed care or went 
without treatment due to COVID fears or staffing shortages. Health care employment is down by 
378,000 jobs (-2.3%) from its level in February 2020 (BLS 2022b), with nursing homes accounting for a 
disproportionate share of losses (AHCA/NCAL 2021). Chronic shortages in direct care occupations 
predated the pandemic and have only gotten worse (PHI 2017). Problems in this sector affect older 
workers who provide care to parents, spouses, and other loved ones, as well as older workers employed 
in these low-paid and often dangerous occupations.  
The Build Back Better Act would greatly improve the lives of older workers and enable some of them 
to return to the workforce. Build Back Better includes significant funding for home and community-
based services (HCBS) under Medicaid, helping people in poor health who prefer to live at home rather 
than in long-term care facilities and allowing some family caregivers to return to work. Build Back Better 
also creates a paid family and medical leave program to help family caregivers take time off to care for 
loved ones, and improves the pay and working conditions of paid caregivers, including through collective 
bargaining. 
The United States is one of the few countries that does not guarantee access to paid sick leave. This is 
bad enough under normal circumstances, but it is especially problematic to force individuals to bear the 
cost of staying home to protect coworkers and the public in a pandemic—or worse yet, give them a 
choice between working sick or losing their jobs. Two-thirds of low-wage workers lack access to paid sick 
leave (Gould 2021), including many home health aides and other frontline workers who have seen high 
rates of COVID infection. 
Impact on the economy 
Just as we need to differentiate between older workers who can retire comfortably from those for 
whom exiting the workforce creates hardship, employment losses can have a greater or lesser impact 
on the economy depending on the worker, the job, and the state of the economy. A full-time worker 
who exits the workforce years before he or she expected to retire has a greater impact on the economy 
than the loss of a semi-retired part-time worker who planned to retire soon regardless. Likewise, early 
retirements have less of an impact in an economy suffering from inadequate demand, when retirements 
can open up jobs for unemployed younger workers. However, this is not the situation we are in now. 
Early retirements affect a country’s productive capacity not just by reducing employment and work 
hours, but also from the loss of human capital. This is especially problematic when the affected workers 
are directly involved in caring for, educating, and protecting the current and future workforce and 
providing other critical services. We should therefore be very concerned about a wave of early 
retirements among educators, nurses, postal workers, and other public-sector workers. 
K-12 schools and other local government employers have shed an alarming number of jobs in the 
pandemic. Employment in this sector, which skews toward older workers, had never fully recovered 
from the Great Recession. The pandemic exacerbated preexisting problems, including a dwindling 
teacher pipeline. Though job losses in this sector include quits and retirements in addition to the impact 
of school closings and other pandemic disruptions, the education exodus reflects worsening conditions 
in jobs that already paid little or, in the case of highly-educated teachers, were grossly underpaid 
compared to similar workers in the private sector (Cooper and Martinez Hickey 2022). The job losses in 
this critical sector occurred despite federal aid to state and local governments, some of which has not 
been spent wisely or not spent at all. 
Conclusion 
My testimony has focused on pandemic-related effects and policies, but many challenges facing older 
workers predate the pandemic and require long-term solutions. Though some of these, such as an 
Older Workers Bureau, are targeted at older workers, most policies that would help older workers 
would also help other vulnerable workers, such as raising the minimum wage, strengthening collective 
bargaining rights, guaranteeing paid leave, addressing unpredictable and involuntary part-time 
schedules, combating employer misclassification of workers as independent contractors, and other 
policies that support good jobs with decent pay and benefits (EPI Policy Agenda).  "

Testimony of Jocelyn Frye 
President, National Partnership for Women & Families 
 
United States Joint Economic Committee 
 
Hearing: Building a Better Labor Market: Empowering Older Workers for a Stronger Economy 
February 9, 2022 
 
 
Good afternoon, Chairman Beyer, Ranking Member Lee and members of the Committee. Thank 
you for the opportunity to discuss the challenges facing older workers. 
 
My name is Jocelyn Frye and I am the president of the National Partnership for Women & Families 
(National Partnership). The National Partnership is a nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy organization 
based in Washington, D.C. We promote fairness in the workplace, reproductive health and rights, 
access to quality, affordable health care, and policies that help all people, especially women, meet 
the dual demands of work and family. Over the last five decades, we have focused specifically on 
tackling gender-based barriers, often rooted in longstanding stereotypes and biases, used to limit 
the opportunities available to women, men, gender minorities, and all those deemed to be out of 
step with assumptions about so-called proper gender norms or roles. We believe that it is essential 
to prioritize equity – in health care and health care systems, in our economy, in our workplaces – 
to create environments fully capable of responding to the diverse needs of patients, workers, and 
indeed all people regardless of their background or resources. Our goal is to create a society that 
is free, fair and just, where nobody has to experience discrimination, all workplaces are family 
friendly, and every family has access to quality, affordable health care and real economic security. 
 
Older workers are vital to their families, to our communities and to our economy. But all too often, 
older workers, particularly older women workers, are missing from public conversations about 
how to support workers, improve workplaces, and strengthen our economy. In the instances when 
older workers are mentioned, their stories are frequently over-simplified and incomplete with the 
diverse, divergent experiences of older workers reduced to a single, rosy soundbite about rising 
stock and housing values – on average – that supposedly lead to comfortable retirements that last 
forever. But this under-inclusive narrative misses the mark and has the effect of ignoring the 
experiences of too many workers. There is no average older worker. They do not all experience 
the same economic opportunities, working conditions, family caregiving needs, or societal drivers 
of health such as whether they are exposed to the stress of racism and sexism, they live in an 
economically distressed community, or their neighborhood lacks safe air and water.  
 
It is essential to elevate accurate narratives about who older workers are, what their employment 
experiences  are,  and  how  their  work  lives  are  interconnected  with  their  health  and  family 
 
1 
 
caregiving needs, especially for women. These narratives are even more important given the 
persistence of the coronavirus pandemic that continues to wreak havoc across the country, 
worsening the economic and health challenges that many older workers often confront. Millions 
of older workers face significant barriers to their ability to work and save during what should be 
peak earning years, and to retire with dignity when they choose to do so. These barriers can be 
especially acute for workers who face multiple forms of bias, such as older women of color 
workers who confront the intersecting effects of race, gender, and age bias. Many have been 
economically scarred by discrimination in the workplace and job market, poor-quality jobs 
stemming from low wages and few benefits, resume gaps necessitated by family caregiving, or the 
lack of support to address their own care needs. The early evidence indicates the pandemic has 
only exacerbated these issues for many, particularly the Black women, Latinas, and Asian and 
Pacific  Islander  women  whose  employment  has  been  disproportionately  harmed  since  the 
pandemic’s onset and has yet to fully recover.

Three decades have passed since the landmark federal Glass Ceiling Commission (Commission) 
took on the task of understanding the barriers to women’s advancement in the workplace, and 
identifying  where  and  how  women’s  economic  progress  had  slowed.  The  creation  of  the 
 
2 
 
Commission, established by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, was intended to take a comprehensive 
look at the diverse experiences of women workers and generate concrete solutions to expand their 
job and advancement opportunities. Those decades brought important progress: the passage of the 
Family and Medical Leave Act, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, advances for women’s health in 
the Affordable Care Act. But progress on other indicators, like labor force participation rates, has 
been uneven – and even reversed during the pandemic. And, longstanding gender- and race-based 
pay disparities continue to persist. At a moment of unprecedented challenges, it is important to 
take stock of where we are and recognize the need to reset our approach to women’s employment 
by  closely  examining  the  impact  of  the  pandemic,  including  on  the  earnings,  labor  force 
participation and experiences of older women workers. 
 
Policymakers can and must act now to support older women workers, and all workers, with policies 
to raise wages and improve jobs, to fight discrimination and other barriers to equitable participation 
in the economy and to ensure that all workers can manage their health and caregiving needs. 
 
I. Older Women Workers’ Families Depend on Them – But Many Are on Shaky Ground 
 
Families in the United States depend on women both as caregivers and as breadwinners. This is 
not only true of mothers of young children, but also of women workers in what ought to be their 
prime earning years – age 45 to 54 – and those nearing retirement age – 55 to 64. Many of the 
challenges and needs of older women workers are rooted in earlier life experiences, in particular 
those related to employment, parenting and family caregiving. 
 
Labor Market and Workplace Inequities Undercut Women of Color 
Gender-, race- and age-based discrimination and harassment continue to impede women and 
workers of color in the labor market and in workplaces, from hiring to salary and promotion 
decisions.1 Longstanding attitudes and stereotypes about the capabilities of older workers has led 
to persistent age discrimination – an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) report 
on age discrimination in employment notes that six in ten workers over the age of 45 state that 
they have seen or experienced age discrimination at work, with workers of color and women 
reporting these discrimination problems at even higher rates.2 At the same time, only a small 
percentage of older workers – an estimated 3 percent – have filed formal complaints about age 
discrimination, suggesting significant under-reporting about the scope of the problem.3 The last 
three decades have seen a steady rise in the number of women filing age discrimination charges 
with the EEOC. In 1990, men filed almost double the number of age discrimination charges as 
women, but by 2010 that trend had completely shifted, with women for the first time filing more 
charges than men. Data from 2017 reveal that this increase in charge filings by women has 
continued to outpace those filed by men and grown wider over time.4 Furthermore, as the 
workforce has become more diverse, age discrimination charges filed by workers of color and 
workers alleging age discrimination in combination with other forms of discrimination, such as 
 
3 
 
age and sex discrimination or age and disability discrimination, have also increased significantly 
over time.5 All of these dynamics also contribute to occupational segregation of women and 
workers of color into lower-paid positions, a major driver of gender and racial wage gaps.6 
Workers of color are more likely to experience racial and sexual harassment as well as other forms 
of retaliation, for example for speaking up about unsafe working conditions,7 which not only 
pushes talented workers out of jobs but also adds to lifetime stress and worsens their health. And 
workers of color are typically laid off first during economic downturns and tend to experience 
longer periods of unemployment due to discrimination in hiring. Women are also more likely to 
work in insecure jobs with low wages and few benefits, frequently referred to as “low-quality 
jobs”: women make up nearly two-thirds of workers in the forty lowest-paid jobs, with women of 
color especially overrepresented.8 
 
These factors mean that, compared with white men, women and workers of color tend to be paid 
less at each stage of their careers. In fact, the gender wage gap is larger for older women compared 
to younger women.9  
 
Median Earnings for Full Time, Year-Round Workers in 2020, by Age 
       25 - 34  35 - 44  45 - 54  55 - 64 
All men  $51,857  $67,372  $71,088  $69,625 
All women  $48,550  $55,172  $55,311  $53,365 
Wage ratio  $0.94  $0.82  $0.78  $0.77 
Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2021). Current Population Survey.  
 
In 2020, across all working age women, among women who hold full-time, year-round jobs in the 
United States, white, non-Hispanic women are typically paid 79 cents, Black women 64 cents, 
Native American women 60 cents, and Latina women just 57 cents.  Data from 2019 revealed that 
subpopulations of Asian American and Pacific Islander women earned as little as 52 cents, such 
as Burmese women, and AAPI women overall earned just 85 cents for every dollar paid to white, 
non-Hispanic men.10 
 
     Low-quality jobs deny workers the basic supports they need to be economically stable. In the 
private sector, about one in three workers does not have access to a retirement plan at work, nearly 
one in four does not have paid sick days, three in ten are not offered health insurance, nearly six 
in ten do not have paid medical leave through employer-provided temporary disability insurance, 
and nearly eight in ten do not have paid family leave. There are significant racial and ethnic 
inequities in access to these basic supports, and access is especially rare among the lowest-paid 
workers.11 In other words, those with the least extra income to save for an emergency – much less 
for retirement – are also least likely to have essential protections and supports to maintain their 
income and employment when a family crisis arises.

Lack of Caregiving Infrastructure Takes a Toll 
The need for caregiving and caregivers is essential and universal. Every family at some point will 
likely face a caregiving challenge or need caregiving support, whether to care for an ill parent or 
spouse, bond with a new child, or recover from a personal medical challenge. Yet, our nation has 
consistently fallen short in adopting the policies necessary to support workers and families when 
these  needs  arise.  Instead,  women  have  been  expected  to  shoulder  the  bulk  of  caregiving 
responsibilities, stemming in part from longstanding stereotypes and attitudes about women’s roles 
and duties. The United States’ longstanding lack of caregiving infrastructure is connected to the 
devaluation of caregiving and care workers that has been entrenched in our society for decades. 
Our unwillingness to invest in care is due, in part, to our unwillingness to treat care as “real work” 
and to treat care workers as “real workers” deserving of strong protections and supports. This is 
rooted in a history of racism and sexism harkening back to the nation’s earliest days, during which 
enslaved Black women were forced to work as caregivers for many white families, while being 
denied any legal right to care for their own loved ones.  
 
In more recent generations, caregiving has been stereotyped as feminine, relegated to the private 
space of the home rather than the public sphere where the “real” economic business of men took 
place. Viewed as a private responsibility, the problem of care is one that individual women and 
 
5 
 
families must solve on their own. In lower-income families, disproportionately families of color, 
this often meant impossible strains between jobs and family, patchwork systems of care from 
extended family or neighbors, and deep financial insecurity. Higher income families – more often 
white – have tended to outsource their care dilemmas, relying on an underpaid care workforce with 
few job protections and largely comprised of women of color.  
 
These policy failures have been on full display throughout the pandemic as families across the 
country have struggled to address their caregiving challenges on their own, without access to 
supports such as paid family and medical leave and quality, affordable child care. The absence of 
robust care policies has had outsized consequences for women workers in particular. The later 
working years are especially critical for women because of the toll taken on their earlier careers 
by systemic inequities and inadequate policies to our lack of caregiving infrastructure, particularly 
among mothers. The lack of paid family and medical leave and affordable child care leave families 
of young children scrambling to manage their caregiving needs, most often at the cost of women’s 
participation in the labor force. Resume gaps, reduced work hours, caregiver discrimination and 
other factors add up into a “motherhood penalty” of about 15 percent of income per child under 
age 5 on average – 18 percent for Latina mothers and 20 percent for Black and Native American 
mothers.12  
 
The lack of caregiving infrastructure not only robs women and their families of a strong start to 
their earning years. It also comes at a high cost to our economy. We have estimated that if women 
in the United States participated in the labor force at the same rate as in comparable countries with 
stronger caregiving supports, there would be up to 4.85 million more women in the U.S. workforce, 
and it would add $650 billion per year to GDP.13  
 
In theory, the later working years should be an opportunity for older women workers to catch up. 
Yet older women workers continue to provide essential care for their loved ones, as well as for 
their own health conditions, without adequate supports. Some are providing care for children: 7.0 
million grandparents live with grandchildren under 18, and 2.3 million grandparents (1.5 million 
of whom are women) are primary caregivers for their grandchildren.14  
 
Many others – more than one in five adults, and about three in ten adults in their forties and fifties 
– are caring for family members who are aging or who have serious health conditions.15 The need 
for family caregivers is only growing: between 2019 and 2040, the population of adults ages 65 
and older is expected to grow from 54 million people to more than 71 million people, comprising 
an estimated 19 percent of the U.S. population.16  
 
A majority of these family caregivers are women. Today, people who care for family members are 
increasingly providing more care that, in prior times, would have been provided by health 
professionals in  a hospital setting, such as managing and coordinating complex medication 
 
6 
 
regimens, administering injections and providing wound care for family members with physical, 
cognitive,  behavioral  health  and  substance  use  disorder  issues.17  Performing  these  more 
complicated tasks is particularly common among family caregivers of adults ages 50 and older – 
more than half (59 percent) of whom report assisting care recipients with medical and nursing 
tasks.18 For many low- and middle- income family caregivers, paid home care assistance is not an 
affordable option to help manage caregiving demands. 
 
Research drawn from an invaluable survey conducted by AARP and the National Alliance of 
Caregiving reveals that six in ten family caregivers report at least one significant impact on their 
employment, including cutting days short or taking time off (53 percent), reducing work hours (15 
percent), turning down a promotion (7 percent) or even giving up working (5 percent) or retiring 
early (4 percent).19 About one in five caregivers report high financial strain related to caregiving, 
and nearly half report at least one financial impact, including stopping saving money (28 percent), 
taking on more debt (23 percent) or using up short-term savings (22 percent). These negative 
impacts were more likely among caregivers with household incomes under $50,000 and caregivers 
age 50 to 64.20 
 
In terms of race and ethnicity, the survey data show that caregivers are similar to the population 
overall: About six in ten are white, 14 percent are Black, 17 percent Hispanic, and five percent 
Asian American. But the limited data available indicates that their experiences are not all alike. 
Caregivers of color tend to be younger on average, and a larger share of Black and Hispanic 
caregivers have incomes below $50,000, compared to white and Asian American caregivers.21 
Black and Hispanic caregivers also report more financial impacts of caregiving on average.22 More 
data is needed, for example, to better understand the experience of Native American caregivers 
and  other  caregiving  experiences  within  communities  of  color.  Greater  investments  in 
comprehensive, disaggregated data, collected more regularly would help policymakers better 
understand caregivers’ experiences and needs, and which communities are facing the most acute 
challenges.

Older Workers and Workers with Disabilities Need Better Jobs and Supports to Succeed 
Older workers, as well as younger workers with disabilities, are not only especially likely to be 
caregivers. They are also more likely than average to experience serious medical or health 
conditions – while also being an important part of our labor force. By 2030, one in four workers 
in the U.S. will be 55 or older,23 and an estimated six million people with disabilities are currently 
in the labor force.24 The right investments could not only help these workers keep and succeed in 
their jobs, but also make employment accessible to others who would like to work, and potentially 
help ease labor shortages without shortchanging workers.  
 
But job conditions and job quality matter immensely, particularly with respect to who is able to 
continue working into their later years. More than one in three older women workers (37.7 
percent), and just over half of older men workers (62.3 percent), hold jobs that are either physically 
demanding or have difficult work conditions. Older Black, Latino and Asian and Pacific Islander 
workers tend to be more likely than older white workers to work in such jobs.25 Many of these 
jobs, such as retail, janitorial and building cleaning, home health care and grounds maintenance, 
also tend to have low wages and few benefits. In other words, a significant share of older workers 
hold jobs that grow increasingly difficult to continue into older age – but that also leave them at a 
disadvantage when it comes to saving for retirement.

Paid medical leave and paid sick leave are essential to enabling older adults to maintain economic 
security in the event of illness or injury, and to continue working if they want to do so.26 In addition, 
older workers and workers with disabilities need robust enforcement of civil rights protections to 
address age- and disability-related discrimination. Improved health and safety standards, along 
with enforcement targeting high-risk occupations and industries, and empowering workers to 
collectively bargain and have a say in improving workplace safety, are also essential for the well-
being of older workers. 
 
Every person deserves to age with dignity and with care. Access to quality health care, meaningful 
retirement savings and other basic supports is critical – and so is the availability of caregivers to 
provide support when serious health needs arise. Without paid family and medical leave, flexible 
work schedules, and adequate investments in home- and community-based services, a significant 
share of older workers will continue to face increased financial and work strains that set them up 
for an insecure retirement. Their loved ones will struggle to find the care they need to live and age 
where they choose. And as the population ages – by 2030, one in four workers in the U.S. will be 
55 or older – employers and our economy will struggle if the older workers do not receive the 
supports they need to stay in the labor force.27 
 
Without Action, the Pandemic’s Long-Term Effects Will Be Long-Reaching 
The pandemic has been a once-in-a-century crisis in health and caregiving that continues to send 
shocks through our workplaces and economy. Workers of color and women make up large shares 
of those employed in frontline jobs – many of them low-wage – that have carried greater risk of 
exposure and potential infection. Increased exposure, compounded by adverse social determinants 
of health – unsafe working conditions, lack of access to health care, medical discrimination, racism 
in health care, even cramped living conditions caused by unaffordable housing – has meant that 
many of the same communities that faced preexisting health inequities have borne the highest 
caseloads and worst mortality from COVID-19.  
 
The economic fallout of the pandemic was concentrated in the same communities that were most 
exposed to the virus itself. People of color, particularly women, were disproportionately employed 
 
9 
 
in industries hit hard by pandemic-related closures, layoffs and reduced hours. At the same time, 
they  also  faced  increased  demands  for  family  caregiving.  These  factors,  combined  with 
longstanding economic vulnerabilities, combined to push millions into part-time work, out of jobs 
and even out of the workforce. Women of color felt the steepest employment losses and shifts to 
part-time work, and have been slowest to return to their pre-pandemic employment levels.

Much attention has understandably been paid to the impacts of pandemic caregiving on parents of 
young children, especially mothers. But older workers have also experienced notable declines in 
employment and labor force participation since 2019.

According to our analysis of U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey data, during the two 
weeks ending January 10, 2022, about 8.8 million adults were not working because they were 
either sick with or caring for a loved one with COVID-19, including about 2.9 million adults aged 
45-64. More than half were women.28 This data provides a snapshot in time, but indicates the 
substantial impact health and caregiving needs continue to have on women even two years into the 
pandemic.

We do not yet know the full long-term impact that these pandemic-driven losses will have on 
economic outcomes for women and their families, but without timely, smart investments in job 
quality and economic security the effects are likely to be severe and to ripple through several 
generations. A younger woman leaving the workforce for five years to care for a child or other 
loved one will see her lifetime earnings reduced by about 19 percent, or approximately $540,000 
over a career.29 On average, a woman 50 or older who leaves the workforce early for caregiving 
will lose an estimated $400,000 in lost income and retirement benefits.30 And neither of these 
figures account for additional pandemic-related effects. For older women workers hoping to retire 
 
11 
 
with dignity and security, and for their families, especially families of color, these are difficult 
losses to bear. 
 
II. Income and Wealth Gaps Leave Retirement Security Out of Reach  
 
Over a lifetime, employment inequities and our lack of support for caregivers lead to large gaps in 
retirement savings and other financial assets, as well as other forms of wealth such as housing 
equity. Common topline statistics such as average retirement savings can be deeply misleading 
because assets are increasingly concentrated among the wealthiest households, and can conceal 
deep and intersecting inequities related to race, gender and class. The wealthiest ten percent of 
households - which are nearly 90 percent white - hold more than three-quarters of all wealth in the 
United States, with a median net worth of more than $1.9 million. Among the bottom 20 percent, 
median net worth is just $9,300.31 
 
Among households headed by mid-career and older workers, between the ages of 39 and 54,      half      
have less than $32,000 in financial assets. Among Black households, half hold less than about 
$9,000; among Hispanic households, half hold less than $4,600.32 Forty-two percent of households 
headed by someone between the ages of 45 and 54 do not even have a retirement account.33 
 
Social Security remains the foundation of retirement security for these and all workers. But the 
structure of Social Security retirement benefits also echoes inequities that women and workers of 
color experience in their working years. Wage gaps mean that these workers tend to receive lower 
benefits, and time spent out of the workforce for caregiving undermines the ability of many 
workers, especially women, to earn credits toward retirement. And the growing problem of worker 
misclassification, including the advent of platform-based employment in driving, delivery and 
even health care, threatens to leave many workers – again, disproportionately workers of color34 – 
outside the protection of this bedrock system.

Early retirement may be getting headlines, but it is simply not an option for many, particularly 
low-income workers and workers of color. In fact, a recent analysis published by the St. Louis 
Federal Reserve Bank found that the uptick in retirements since early 2020 has been mainly among 
workers who were already at retirement age – 65 and older – while the retirement rate among 
workers 55 to 64 has not risen significantly. Demographic trends hint at a complex story, likely 
one in which more-advantaged workers have greater choice about whether to retire or continue 
working, while less-advantaged workers either must keep working longer – or are forced to retire 
when work become impossible or age discrimination pushes them out of the labor force.35 
 
III. Policy Supports for Older Women Workers Will Create a More Robust, Equitable 
Economy for All 
 
Two years into the coronavirus pandemic, women’s labor force participation is lower than it was 
in 1991 when the Glass Ceiling Commission was formed to examine women’s stalled progress in 
the economy (the labor force participation rate stood at 56.8 percent as of January 2022, compared 
to 57.3 percent in January 1991).36 The current moment calls for a reset of our narratives and our 
policies to focus on a comprehensive set of strategies to improve employment opportunities and 
outcomes for older women workers.  
 
Investing in the policies and supports that older women workers need will help them and their 
families thrive, and help our economy grow.  
 
 
13 
 
It is past time for the United States to invest in a robust care infrastructure that ensures a 
continuum of support across the lifespan, as was laid out in the House-passed Build Back Better 
Act.  
●  Enacting a comprehensive national paid family and medical leave program will improve 
gender and racial equity in caregiving and in workplaces, and will support the health and 
caregiving needs of all working people across their lifespans – including older women 
workers who are family caregivers. 
●  Investments in quality, affordable child care will help parents – especially mothers – enter 
and remain in the workforce while raising young children. Child care investments will also 
improve  job  quality  for  child  care  workers,  who  are  overwhelmingly  women  and 
disproportionately women of color. 
●  Adequate funding for home- and community-based services will improve care quality and 
support dignity and self-determination for older adults and people with disabilities, as well 
as improving job quality for our largely-female care workforce and reducing costs for 
families. 
 
Congress can take actions to improve job quality to raise incomes and improve economic 
security for working people and their families, in ways that advance gender and racial equity 
across our economy. 
●  Pass the Healthy Families Act to ensure that all workers are able to earn paid sick days, 
which will have significant public health as well as economic benefits. 
●  Pass the Raise the Wage Act to finally raise the federal minimum wage and phase out 
subminimum  wages  for  tipped  workers  and  workers  with  disabilities,  which  will 
disproportionately benefit women and Black and Latinx workers. 
●  Pass the Schedules That Work Act to improve the predictability and flexibility of workers 
in many low-wage occupations, better enabling them to manage health and caregiving 
needs and improving income stability. 
●  Pass the PRO Act to help more workers access the benefits of collective bargaining and 
have a voice in their workplaces. 
 
Congress should act to strengthen and support robust enforcement of our labor and civil rights 
laws to ensure older women and workers of color are paid fairly, treated justly and have truly equal 
opportunities to advance in their jobs. 
●  Pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to address persistent pregnancy discrimination that 
threatens the health and economic well-being of pregnant workers. 
●  Pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to prohibit employers from retaliating against employees 
who discuss their wages, close loopholes that make it easier for employers to rationalize 
discriminatory decisionmaking, and prohibit screening of job applicants based on their 
salary histories which holds down wages for women. 
 
14 
 
●  Significantly  increase  funding  for  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission, 
Department of Labor and Department of Justice to support increased enforcement of civil 
rights and employment discrimination laws, including increasing the number of corporate 
management reviews (often called “glass ceiling reviews”) conducted by the DOL-Office 
of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. 
●  Empower a commission or interagency working group to further investigate the factors 
holding back women in our economy, especially older women, develop a robust evidence 
base for future policy development, and recommend concrete action steps that should be 
taken in the short-term to improve employment opportunities for older women workers.

Chairman Don Beyer – Prepared Remarks 
 
“Building a Better Labor Market: Empowering Older Workers for 
a Stronger Economy” 
February 9, 2022
 
Recognitions 
This hearing will come to order. I would like to welcome everyone to 
the Joint Economic Committee’s hearing titled “Building a Better Labor 
Market: Empowering Older Workers for a Stronger Economy.” 
I want to thank each of our truly distinguished witnesses for sharing 
their expertise today. Now, I would like to turn to my opening statement. 
Opening statement 
Without question, older workers are vital to our collective prosperity.  
 
They support families and communities nationwide, and they bring 
decades of earned experience and wisdom to businesses and 
marketplaces, large and small.  
 
Prior to the pandemic, older Americans contributed 40% of the national 
economic output despite making up just 35% of the population. And 
over the last twenty years, the share of older workers has almost 
doubled—a trend that is set to continue even after the pandemic. 
 
 
As the United States continues its strong recovery, a primary task before 
us in Congress must be answering how we can build a stronger and more 
resilient economy, where the benefits from economic growth are broadly 
shared. Key to such an economy is a better labor market that ensures all 
workers, including older workers, have access to quality jobs that meet 
their needs and are free from discrimination. 
Over the past year, the U.S. economy has experienced record job 
growth, with over 6.6 million new jobs created in 2021, and almost half 
a million more in January alone.  
This robust labor market recovery, thought unimaginable in the spring of 
2020, when unemployment was nearing 15%, is a testament to the 
American Rescue Plan, other emergency pandemic relief, and the 
widespread availability of vaccines and testing. 
But even as we recognize the record-breaking economic 
accomplishments of the last year, we must also address the ways our 
recovery has not yet reached everyone—including older workers.   
 
Older workers have long faced unique challenges in the workforce, and 
these challenges were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Decades of diminished bargaining power, stagnant wage growth, 
diminishing returns from additional years of working, and increasingly 
strenuous and dangerous jobs have contributed to widespread economic 
insecurity among older workers and constricted broad-based economic 
growth. 
 
The pandemic has also shined new light on the inadequacy of our care 
infrastructure to help older workers navigate work and care 
responsibilities. This has been particularly harmful to older Black and 
Hispanic women, who shoulder significant caregiving responsibilities.  
 
For example, one-third of home health aides are aged 55 and older, yet 
care industry wages are low and care work is physically demanding. 
This creates an untenable situation for aging providers as they are 
simultaneously less physically able to continue their work but also 
financially unable to save and retire securely. 
 
Further, more than one in five workers aged 45 to 64 reports being a 
caregiver to a parent. Yet the United States does not guarantee any 
workers the right to paid leave, and older workers are even less likely 
than their younger counterparts to have access to paid sick days. This 
forces many older workers to make the impossible choice between 
caring for themselves or a loved one and getting a paycheck, which 
harms workers, businesses, and the broader economy. 
 
Today, we are seeing these decades-long trends impacting older workers 
come to a head. Just as companies have historically used downturns to 
prune workplaces of older workers, the same appears to be true of the 
coronavirus recession. At least 1.7 million more older workers than 
expected retired due to the pandemic recession, and the effects have 
been particularly harmful for older Black workers and those without a 
college degree. 
 
Despite media coverage of high-income older workers choosing 
retirement to spend more time on hobbies and with their families, 
evidence shows this is not the reality for many older workers.  
 
The reality is that over the course of the pandemic, many older workers 
have been forced out of jobs to live on insufficient retirement income. 
For the first time in 50 years, the unemployment rate for older workers 
was higher than that of mid-career workers, and while rates have 
stabilized, older workers remain overrepresented among those who are 
currently long-term unemployed. 
 
Because our retirement system has not kept up with the needs of the 
aging workforce, the typical worker in the United States has zero 
retirement savings—that’s right, no retirement savings at all. Among 
those that do, the amount is wholly insufficient to sustain a pre-
retirement standard of living.  
 
As those who have been forced into early retirement may look to be 
rehired, research shows they will experience significant barriers. 
Particularly in recessionary periods, older workers face discrimination 
and stigma from periods of long-term unemployment, both of which 
limit their re-employment opportunities.  
 
No worker should be forced into early retirement. And at the same time, 
no one should be forced to work long into their golden years because of 
insufficient retirement savings.  
 
As members of Congress, addressing these challenges in order to help 
build a better labor market for older workers and create a stronger 
economy is central to our work.  
 
I look forward to this discussion and learning from our witnesses today.

Opening Statement 
JEC Hearing on “Building a Better Labor Market: 
Empowering Older Workers for a Stronger Economy” 
Wednesday, February 9 at 2:30pm ET 
 
Older Americans are the bedrock of our communities. It's 
hard to overstate their role. We rely on our grandparents 
for everything, from helping to care for our children to 
building our churches and volunteering at our local 
charities.  
Increasingly, older Americans also make vital contributions 
in the workforce. More of America’s seniors are choosing 
to work because they find work to be a source of 
engagement and meaning in the transition to their golden 
years. 
Tad Greener is a fellow Utahn who was missing the social 
connections and professional satisfaction of work after 
being out of a job for the past two years due to his health. 
Like so many other older Americans, when he started 
looking for a job again, he thought he’d never get a leg up 
navigating the endless changes brought on by the 
pandemic.  
That’s when Tad saw a story about Return Utah—a new 
program created by Utah’s Lieutenant Governor Deidre 
Henderson to help Utahns who are looking for work after 
an extended absence. Tad applied and was surprised to 
1 
 
find that the Utah Office of Energy Development needed 
someone with his technical skills. Although the position 
was temporary, after just two months into the job, he was 
made a permanent team member and is now able to put 
his years of experience to use.  
Tad’s story is inspiring for the millions of American 
workers who are still on the sidelines, and it’s instructive 
for us today as we seek to understand the barriers older 
Americans face. As many choose to work longer, a strong 
labor market with rising wages for all is the most effective 
way to create new opportunities and support older 
Americans. 
The good news for us today is that older Americans are 
doing better than they ever have before. Thanks to 
improved health and less physically demanding jobs, 
many older Americans are remaining in the workforce 
longer, and more employers are benefiting from their 
reliability and experience.   
Older Americans who choose to retire are also better set 
up for economic security than ever before. Americans 
have never saved more for retirement or had higher 
incomes in their golden years. Poverty among seniors is 
lower than among any other age group, and the 
preliminary data indicate that those who left the workforce 
during the pandemic did so because they can better afford 
to retire.

Older workers are doing remarkably well. What older 
workers don’t need are new, special-interest programs 
and policies cooked up in Washington and delivered half-
baked by bureaucrats from thousands of miles away.  
First, let’s fix what’s broken.  
Government spending has stoked the highest inflation rate 
this country has seen in four decades, and it’s hurting all 
Americans, including our seniors—many of whom live on 
fixed incomes. Government programs intended to care for 
seniors often punish those who want to stay connected to 
the workforce longer. And the threat of vaccine mandates 
continues to hang over our country, cruelly forcing 
Americans to choose between the freedom to make their 
own health decisions and their jobs.  
Ultimately, a thriving, unencumbered economy is the best 
way to allow older Americans to make the choices best 
suited for themselves and their families—whether that’s 
spending more time with the kids and grandkids, 
volunteering in a local congregation, maintaining a long 
healthy working life, or all of the above. I look forward to 
hearing from our witnesses on how we can foster this type 
of prosperity. 
Thank you.
