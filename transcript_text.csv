Senate Appropriations Committee – February 1, 2022 – Written Testimony 
Written Statement of  
Gina M. Raimondo  
Secretary 
U.S. Department of Commerce  
 
Before the Senate Committee on Appropriations  
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies 
  
“Expanding Broadband Access: Department of Commerce Broadband Programs in the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act”  
February 1, 2022 
Chair Shaheen, Ranking Member Moran, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for 
the opportunity to discuss the broadband funding in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act, better known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  
Too many families can’t afford the cost of broadband service, and too many families live in 
areas where they can’t access high-speed internet. 
Gaps in access mean gaps in opportunity:  fewer opportunities to learn and work from home, 
remotely visit doctors, or stay connected with family and friends.  Achieving an equitable 
future means ensuring that all homes and businesses have high-quality connections at 
affordable prices, and that users have the devices and digital skills needed for meaningful use. 
Our economy cannot fully recover unless all Americans can fully participate. 
This is why President Biden set an ambitious goal when he entered office: connecting every 
American through affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband.  
I want to thank the many members of this committee – both Democrat and Republican – who 
worked with us to negotiate the broadband provisions of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 
specifically you, Madam Chair, Sen. Manchin, Sen. Collins, and Sen. Murkowski. 
I’m proud that the broadband provisions of the bill ultimately helped it to pass with significant 
bipartisan support. 
Thanks to your work, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $65 billion to deliver reliable, 
high-speed internet to every American, lower the price of internet service, and help close the 
digital divide. 
Of those funds, $48.2 billion is allocated to Commerce’s National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration.

Senate Appropriations Committee – February 1, 2022 – Written Testimony 
Specifically, the law provides:  
•  $42.45 billion for the Broadband Equity, Access & Deployment Program (BEAD). The 
program will award grants to states and territories to fund high-speed affordable 
broadband for households and businesses that currently lack access to such services.  
•  $2 billion for Tribal broadband grants, tripling the funding for NTIA’s existing Tribal 
Broadband Connectivity Program.  
•  $2.75 billion to fund the Digital Equity Act. This provides NTIA with funding for three 
grant programs to promote digital inclusion and equity for communities that lack the 
skills, technologies, and support needed to take advantage of broadband connections. 
•  $1 billion for middle-mile connections to build a high-speed backbone to help reduce 
the cost to serve households, businesses, and anchor institutions. 
Today, I’m grateful for the opportunity to update you on our progress as we prepare to launch 
these programs in a little more than 100 days. 
We want to ensure that broadband deployment is successful and affordable in every corner of 
the country, in every type of community, and for your constituents. 
Our goal at the Commerce Department is to make sure that every small business, farm, family, 
and student in America has access to affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband. 
We’re focused on getting this done right and giving states the flexibility they need to ensure 
this benefits everyone. 
In Rhode Island, where I come from the challenge there is less about physical broadband 
infrastructure and more about ensuring affordability.  It does no good to live in a location 
where broadband is available if you can’t afford to get it. 
Many rural communities, on the other hand, have no broadband. Our task ahead is to lay the 
infrastructure and ensure people in even the most rural corners of our country can get online. 
Essentially: it doesn’t make sense to address Kansas challenges with Rhode Island solutions. 
That’s why the law has built-in flexibility to address each states’ specific needs. 
Under the law, each state will get a minimum of $100 million, and the remaining money will be 
allocated by need, based primarily on the number of unserved households. 
States will be given initial planning funds that they can use to develop a five-year action plan, 
in collaboration with local and regional entities, to cover everyone in their state.

Senate Appropriations Committee – February 1, 2022 – Written Testimony 
We’re going to work with your states to fund projects that will make the greatest impact and 
achieve universal broadband access. 
This unprecedented investment in closing the digital divide also requires input from a wide 
range of voices to assist our design and implementation of the new grant programs.  
Stakeholder engagement is critical to getting this right. 
Over the past two months, NTIA has held three virtual, public listening sessions to help inform 
the development and implementation of the broadband programs in the law.  We’ve met with 
state and local governments, non-profit and civic organizations, higher education institutions, 
and industry.  
Last month, NTIA issued a request for comment to gain further input into the program design, 
policy issues, and other implementation considerations for the programs launching this year. 
Comments are due on February 4.  
This work builds on prior broadband programs, including the three grant programs funded by 
the bipartisan Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2021. 
The largest of these is the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program (TBCP), which will award 
nearly $1 billion to expand broadband access and adoption on Tribal lands.  
We received nearly 300 applications from across the country − from large infrastructure 
projects to small internet-adoption programs. The requests amount to more than $5 billion in 
funds -- a strong signal of the intense need for broadband investments in Native American, 
Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities. 
As I mentioned, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law appropriated an additional $2 billion for the 
TBCP. Last month, NTIA conducted a Tribal Consultation to receive input on this funding.  
The Connecting Minority Communities Pilot Program will direct $268 million toward expanding 
broadband access and connectivity to eligible Historically Black Colleges or Universities, Tribal 
Colleges or Universities, minority-serving institutions, and nearby anchor communities. 
NTIA has received over 200 applications, resulting in more than $833 million in funding 
requests for the purchase of broadband internet service and equipment, among other project 
goals. 
Finally, the Broadband Infrastructure Program will direct $288 million in grant funding toward 
the deployment of broadband infrastructure. 
NTIA received over 230 applications, totaling more than $2.5 billion in funding requests across 
49 states and U.S. territories.

Senate Appropriations Committee – February 1, 2022 – Written Testimony 
We expect to make the awards for this program later this month. 
Thanks to the historic and bipartisan investments you have made, we’re moving towards our 
goal of connecting all Americans to affordable, high-speed broadband. 
We know that for our economy, businesses, and workers to be competitive in the 21st century 
economy, we need to get this done.  
I’m eager to work with you in the months ahead and look forward to answering your questions 
about the vital work being done at the Department of Commerce to close the digital divide.  
Thank you.

STATEMENT OF  
MARTIN J. WALSH 
SECRETARY OF LABOR 
BEFORE THE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON LABOR, 
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES 
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
UNITED STATES SENATE 
 
July 14, 2021 
 
Chairwoman Murray, Ranking Member Blunt, and members of the Subcommittee, thank 
you for the invitation to testify today. I am pleased to appear before this Subcommittee for the 
first time and to outline the Biden Administration’s vision for the Department of Labor in Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2022 and beyond. I am honored and humbled to lead the Department in its critical 
work.  
 
The Department’s mission is to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage 
earners, job seekers, and retirees of the United States; improve working conditions; advance 
opportunities for profitable employment; and assure work-related benefits and rights. This 
mission is personal to me and my family’s story. My father’s participation in the Laborers 
Union, Local 223 in Boston, was the pathway to a fair wage, so my family was not worried about 
housing insecurity. My parents had a safe workplace, so I never knew the fear of them not 
returning from work. The job came with a pension, so my parents could retire with dignity. And 
the job included health insurance, so that when my parents experienced the worst nightmare of 
having a child diagnosed with cancer, they had health insurance so that I could be treated and 
recover.   
 
Years later, I followed my father into construction and joined the same union, and 
experienced those same benefits of having a safe workplace, health insurance, a fair wage, and a 
pension.  These are not abstract policies – these are life-changing rights. I have spent my career 
fighting for the rights of working people as a State Representative, as General Agent for the 
Metro Boston Building Trades Council, and as Mayor of Boston. I feel privileged to continue 
this work as the Secretary of Labor.  
 
American Rescue Plan 
 
As a former Mayor, I know that our communities – and our families – have been hit hard 
by the COVID-19 pandemic. That’s why it was so important that Congress worked with 
President Biden to pass the American Rescue Plan (ARP) to change the course of the pandemic 
and deliver immediate relief for American workers. In terms of jobs, not only did the ARP 
extend unemployment insurance benefits for our friends and neighbors who lost their jobs during 
this pandemic, but it also laid the groundwork for shoring up and modernizing our 
unemployment insurance system to help workers get the benefits they deserve when they need 
1 
 
them. The ARP also helps workers who lost their jobs or had their hours reduced pay for health 
insurance by fully subsidizing COBRA premiums for eligible individuals from April 1 through 
September 30 of this year. And it provides additional funding for the Department to help keep 
vulnerable workers healthy and safe. Finally, ARP also distributes more than $360 billion in 
emergency funding for state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments to ensure that they are in a 
position to keep front line public workers on the job and paid, while also effectively distributing 
the vaccine, scaling testing, reopening schools, and maintaining other vital services. We 
appreciate this landmark law, and we are working hard to ensure that this law is implemented in 
the way that Congress and the President intended to reopen our economy. 
 
American Jobs Plan 
 
As a former construction worker, I know a good job can change your life. One of the 
most important things we do at the Labor Department to improve the economy and strengthen 
the workforce is help people pursue training that leads to good jobs and helps close racial and 
gender equity gaps throughout the economy. The President’s American Jobs Plan is a historic 
investment in the working people of America. It will create millions of good paying, family 
sustaining jobs that rebuild the middle class by empowering our workers to build America’s 
future.  
 
The President’s plan provides funding for sector-based training programs focused on 
growing, high-demand sectors, such as clean energy, manufacturing, and caregiving, helping 
workers of all kinds to find good-quality jobs in an ever-changing economy. In addition, the plan 
provides for a new Dislocated Workers Program that provides comprehensive supports for 
workers who have lost jobs through no fault of their own, to ensure they are able to successfully 
participate in training that can prepare them for in-demand jobs. The plan will prioritize 
workforce development opportunities for underserved communities and ensure job opportunities 
are open to, and support, women, people of color, people with disabilities, and people impacted 
by the criminal justice system, among other disadvantaged groups. Further, subsidized jobs 
programs will support unemployed and underemployed workers who have faced significant 
barriers to employment to gain a key foothold in the labor market. Additional investments to 
establish more pathways to good jobs include creating up to two million new registered 
apprenticeship slots, while strengthening access for women, people of color, and individuals with 
disabilities; creating career pathway programs in middle and high schools, including those that 
increase access for underrepresented students to computer science and other STEM sectors; and 
supporting community college partnerships that build capacity to deliver job training programs 
that lead to good jobs. The plan also makes key investments in expanded career services and 
adult literacy programs to equip job seekers with the tools, information, and foundational skills 
they need to be successful in the labor market. 
 
The plan provides critical funding to strengthen the capacity of our labor enforcement 
agencies to prevent discrimination, protect wages and benefits, enforce health and safety rules, 
and strengthen health care and pension plans. In addition to these investments, the President is 
2 
 
calling for increased penalties when employers violate workplace safety and health rules, which 
have proven inadequate to address serious violations. 
 
FY 2022 Budget: Supporting America’s Workers through the Pandemic to Recovery 
 
Building on the American Rescue Plan and the American Jobs Plan, the Department’s FY 
2022 budget proposes investments in workers and in our country’s future: a future of opportunity 
and shared prosperity, a future of robust job growth and a thriving middle class, a future where 
workers nationwide get the skills and training that leads to jobs that pay a fair wage without 
risking their health or safety. The Department’s budget requests an investment of $14.2 billion in 
discretionary resources, which is a 14 percent increase above the FY 2021 enacted level.  
 
The budget includes resources to expand training opportunities, supporting workers and 
building a better future. There is no single path to a good-paying job, and the country’s future 
growth and prosperity depend, in part, on ensuring workers have multiple pathways to high-
quality, good-paying jobs. To that end, the budget requests $3.7 billion, a six-percent increase, 
for the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and Wagner Peyser state formula grants to 
make employment services and training available to more dislocated workers, low-income 
adults, and disadvantaged youth hurt by the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.    
 
The budget also invests additional resources in programs that serve marginalized groups, 
such as justice-involved individuals, at-risk youth, and vulnerable veterans. While higher-income 
earners have recovered many of the jobs lost, workers in low-wage industries have experienced 
persistent net loss. As seen in the June 2021 Employment Situation, disparities among workers 
continue, and over 5.7 million jobs that existed last February are yet to return. While the overall 
unemployment rate was 5.9 percent, the African American unemployment rate was 9.2 percent 
and the Hispanic rate was 7.4 percent, compared with 5.2 percent for Whites. For individuals 
with disabilities, the unemployment rate was 10.9 percent. Due in large part to the impact of the 
pandemic, there are roughly 3.4 million fewer women working now than there were in February 
2020 – and many women have had to reduce their hours, often in response to caregiving 
demands. Women, particularly women of color, continue to face barriers to good jobs with equal 
pay. The budget prioritizes investments in these communities of color, with a goal of increasing 
success for all groups, because systems that are failing these populations are failing us all.  
 
The Department will continue to invest in proven approaches, such as expanding the 
Registered Apprenticeship model by investing $285 million, an increase of $100 million, which 
will allow the Department to create a more balanced apprenticeship portfolio, support states’ 
efforts to implement a reauthorized National Apprenticeship Act, and further the development of 
youth apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship opportunities, all while increasing equity for under-
represented populations. Registered Apprenticeships provide a pathway to good-paying jobs, and 
as Secretary of Labor, I am committed to expanding these opportunities across the United States, 
in order to help rebuild the middle class and create millions of new opportunities for workers to 
enter into relevant, high quality training that both protects workers’ rights and propels workers 
3 
 
into career paths that provide a sufficient and fair wage. Registered Apprenticeships produce 
strong results for both employers and workers. The Department’s investments in Registered 
Apprenticeship will work to address the systemic disparities that have impacted women, people 
of color, and other under-served and under-represented populations. 
 
This last year has again demonstrated that Unemployment Insurance (UI) is an essential 
social insurance program and economic stabilizer, and it has been a lifeline to millions of 
workers and to the economy throughout the pandemic. Yet the pandemic uncovered longstanding 
problems in the UI system, including the challenges facing states’ administration of their UI 
systems. These systems, in part as a result of persistent underfunding and inadequate technology, 
have been plagued by delays and obstacles that disproportionately affect workers of color. When 
benefits are slow to reach workers who have lost their jobs, it delays both their recovery and 
negatively impacts the country. To address these challenges, the budget provides resources to 
ensure States can better handle higher volumes of claims and be better prepared for future crises 
or high unemployment levels. The budget request fully funds and updates the formula for 
determining the amount states receive to administer UI – the first comprehensive update in 
decades. In addition, the budget requests $100 million to support the development of information 
technology solutions that can be deployed in states to ensure timely and equitable access to 
benefits. The $100 million increase will further support and complement the resources the 
Department was appropriated under the American Rescue Plan to prevent fraud, promote 
equitable access, and ensure timely payment of benefits.  
 
The Biden-Harris Administration has taken stock of the challenges the unemployment 
system faces and developed a set of high-level principles that should guide future efforts to 
reform the UI system. Those principles include ensuring adequate benefit levels and duration for 
unemployed workers; ensuring the UI system can ramp up quickly and automatically in response 
to recessions; addressing the lack of access to UI for workers misclassified as independent 
contractors, low-income and part-time workers, and workers with non-traditional work histories; 
shoring up UI trust funds; and improving UI program access and integrity. 
 
The budget request includes $2.1 billion – a 17 percent increase in funding – for our 
worker protection agencies, enabling the Department to conduct the enforcement and regulatory 
work needed to ensure workers’ wages, benefits, and rights are protected, address the 
misclassification of workers as independent contractors, and improve workplace safety and 
health. These are the staff who recover back wages owed, help prevent fatalities and life-altering 
injuries or illnesses, respond to whistleblower complaints, reduce exposure to cancer-causing 
agents, help ensure retirees get their benefits, and address pay inequities.  
 
Over the past four years, the Department’s worker protection agencies have lost 14 
percent of their staff. A lack of enforcement makes workers more vulnerable to workplace 
violations. The President’s budget reverses this trend by proposing $304 million in additional 
funding for the Department’s worker protection agencies, including $73 million for the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, $67 million for the Mine Safety and Health 
4 
 
Administration, $35 million for the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, $31 
million for the Wage and Hour Division, and $37 million for the Employee Benefits Security 
Administration.  
The budget continues the President’s commitment to tackling the climate crisis. For the 
Department, the request includes an additional $100 million investment in an initiative as part of 
the new Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic 
Revitalization, aimed at reskilling and reemploying displaced workers in legacy energy 
communities. The request also includes $20 million for a new discretionary program, developed 
in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is focused on helping 
transitioning service members, veterans, and military spouses to pursue careers in clean energy, 
which will help combat climate change, while preparing this population for good-paying jobs.  
 
I know we will have a lot of conversations, as we collaborate on the American Jobs Plan 
and the FY 2022 Budget. I look forward to those collaborations and partnering with you all to 
invest in the nation’s economic recovery. The Department plays an important role in expanding 
opportunity.  
 
Madam Chairwoman, Ranking Member, thank you for the opportunity to testify. I look 
forward to discussing our budget request with the committee, and I am happy to respond to any 
questions you may have.

Inspector General, United States Postal Service 
 
A Hearing to Review the FY 2022 Budget Request for the USPS 
Office of Inspector General and USPS Service Issues 
 
July 13, 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Good afternoon Chairman Van Hollen, Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, and Members of 
the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me here today to discuss our budget and 
ongoing work to address the Postal Service’s delivery and service performance issues. 
 
Our mission, to ensure the efficiency, accountability, and integrity of our nation’s Postal 
Service, is something we take very seriously. While we receive our appropriation from 
Congress, the annual funding that enables us to do our work comes from the Postal 
Service, not the U.S. Treasury. We are one of the leanest IG offices, with about one 
OIG employee for every 640 Postal Service employees. Even with those limited 
resources, in FY 2020 we returned nearly $30 in impact for every $1 invested in our 
budget.  
 
Over the past ten years, our budget has not grown meaningfully and has not kept up 
with rising costs, including mandated increases to salary and FERS employer 
contributions. Without additional funding to support these increases, we have had to 
reduce the number of FTEs available to support our work by nearly 16 percent since 
2012. Because of these steadily declining resources, we have had less capacity to 
focus even on the highest priority work.  
 
Our Work  
Our oversight provides the Postal Service valuable insights into areas where it can save 
money, improve operations, and better serve postal customers. With USPS service 
issues foremost in the minds of customers and other stakeholders, we have significantly 
increased our focus in this area since early 2020. Our work has found that operational 
1 
 
changes implemented last summer, on top of employee absences, negatively impacted 
the quality and timeliness of mail delivery. We also identified areas where the Postal 
Service could improve communication and reporting, as well as cost saving 
opportunities such as reducing overtime and better management of late and extra trips.  
This work is vital to ensuring the American public has an efficient Postal Service. We 
have numerous ongoing projects related to service, discussed in more detail, below. 
 
We also conduct critical investigations in a variety of areas, including mail theft by postal 
employees and postal contractors, as well as healthcare and contract fraud. Over the 
past three years, we have committed significant resources to combatting the nationwide 
opioid epidemic and the trafficking of narcotics through the mail. The chart below shows 
some of our progress. Between FYs 2017 and 2020, we have increased the number of 
open cases by 133 percent, the number of arrests by 82 percent, and the number of 
convictions by 78 percent. We strategically placed special agents trained in narcotics 
investigations throughout the country, and this resulted in 427 new cases being initiated 
in FY 2020 alone. In the first half of FY 2021, we have initiated over 300 cases, putting 
us on track to have an almost 50 percent increase compared to FY 2020.  
 
 
We continue to leverage data analytics to increase the transparency of postal data. We 
recently launched a webpage that features an interactive map displaying quarterly data 
on the Postal Service’s performance around the country. Users can filter the information 
by geographic area, mail class, and fiscal quarter, as well as pivot between the Postal 
2 
 
Service’s former and newly lowered service performance targets. Stakeholders have 
reacted positively to this website, and we continue to look for new ways to provide 
similar transparency. Below is a snapshot of our page. 
 
 
 
We also utilize analytics to identify areas of focus for both audit and investigations. For 
example, we have a dashboard that provides a consolidated, holistic view of customer 
complaints and allegations related to missing, delayed, or undelivered mail. It pulls 
information from three data sources: (1) the Postal Service’s complaint system, (2) 
Informed Delivery, and (3) the OIG Hotline. This tool identifies trends in complaints from 
each system to identify areas of concern. Another analytics tool is our dashboard that 
utilizes specific delivery and route data to assess the probability that an entire route was 
not delivered. The tool provides insights to specific routes, facilities, districts, and areas 
where full routes may not be delivered for a single day or over a period of time, 
signifying an ongoing problem. We hope to use these types of analytics to identify hot 
spots and areas where service issues are occurring in almost real-time for both 
investigations and audits.

Our Budget 
The $263 million included in the President’s budget is based on our FY 2022 budget 
submission last fall. This was before the Postal Service announced its plans to make 
significant changes, including the following.  
  The Postal Service is dramatically modifying its large and complex network by 
creating postal facilities dedicated to parcel sortation. Other mail ― letters, flats, 
and containers ― will be processed in separate facilities. This constitutes a 
dramatic change that will require realigning facilities’ footprints around the 
country at the same time the Postal Service is processing the mail in its system.  
  To increase its focus on handling growing parcel volume, the Postal Service is 
adding around 46 annexes and spending almost $9 billion on new equipment, 
including new parcel sorting machines. An investment by the Postal Service of 
this significance requires careful oversight. 
  The Postal Service is moving a portion of its mail volume from air to surface 
transportation, including approximately 9 percent of First-Class Mail volume and 
31 percent of First-Class Package Services volume. The goal of this change is to 
increase service reliability and save costs, but these changes can only be made 
in conjunction with a reduction in service standards. Postal customers are 
concerned the Postal Service will neither reap the financial benefits nor enhance 
service reliability.  
These changes are complex and difficult, and there is a risk implementation could result 
in regional or widespread service issues. Our work has revealed that historically, when 
the Postal Service implements network changes, it has not always been able to improve 
service or realize the projected cost savings.1 Continuous monitoring and oversight of 
the announced network changes will allow the Postal Service to quickly fix issues, 
protecting postal customers. As a result of these significant upcoming changes, we plan 
to request an additional $17 million in our FY 2023 budget to increase the amount and 
timeliness of our oversight. With these funds we can expand our capacity to quickly 
respond to ongoing service challenges.  
 
These funds will partially restore our staffing by 83 employees and allow us to form an 
audit group dedicated to continuous monitoring of service across the country and 
providing quick, service-focused reports. We will build on the lessons learned last fall 
when we sent 500 OIG employees to over 2,000 postal facilities nationwide to monitor 
election mail. Using an OIG-created app, we were able to provide the Postal Service 
and Congress near real-time data on our daily observations. This allowed the Postal

Service to quickly resolve any issues we identified, such as ballots that had not been 
fully processed and cleared from the plant. While our effort was successful, it took 
significant resources and resulted in other investigative and audit projects being put on 
hold. Increased funding would allow us to provide this type of near real-time monitoring 
on a more frequent and national basis as the Postal Service implements network 
changes. This monitoring would enable increased transparency regarding service 
during the holiday mailing season and next year’s mid-term elections. 
 
Continuous near real-time monitoring and quick response reports allow the Postal 
Service to promptly fix the issues we identify, mitigating the negative impacts on postal 
customers. While the $17 million is requested for the FY 2023 budget, the sooner we 
get these additional funds, the sooner we can provide more effective and timely 
oversight. Because the Postal Service is moving quickly to implement some of the 
network changes, it is critical that our resources grow in tandem with these moves.  
 
The recent changes announced by the Postal Service are likely just the beginning. As 
these changes progress, judicious oversight is essential to ensuring timely, efficient, 
and equitable mail service to all areas of the country. 
Overview of Service Issues 
The pandemic brought service issues to the forefront, but even before last spring, the 
Postal Service’s processing network was not operating at optimal efficiency.2 In an 
attempt to meet service standards, the Postal Service utilized overtime, held trucks past 
their departure times, or paid for additional “late” transportation, leading to increased 
costs as well as more service issues down the line.  
 
In the beginning of the pandemic, the Postal Service began to face uncontrollable 
challenges, including employee absenteeism and significantly higher package volume. 
Early on, it was able to lessen the impact on service performance by using extraordinary 
measures, but these were unsustainable.3 Last summer, the Postal Service also 
introduced various operational and organizational changes. When deployed on top of 
employee absences, these changes negatively impacted the quality and timeliness of 
mail delivery.4

During the 2020 general election and subsequent run-offs, the Postal Service was able 
to prioritize the processing of Election Mail and provide timely delivery. However, during 
the holiday season, service worsened significantly. The combination of a lack of 
employee availability, a significant increase in parcels, and poor communication 
between the field and postal headquarters resulted in gridlock at several processing 
plants around the country. The Postal Service was unable to effectively process mail as 
it arrived, resulting in long wait times for truck drivers and protracted delays of mail and

While recently there have been some signs of improvement, concerns about service in 
various parts of the country remain. As a result, we have numerous projects related to 
broad service issues as well as in specific locations where we have received 
complaints. We have an entire team dedicated to examining delivery delays around the 
country, including in Chicago, Kansas City, and Baltimore. Another team is focusing on 
delayed mail at postal processing centers, and it has uncovered issues with how 
delayed mail is reported, adding to the difficulty in determining the causes.   
 
We have numerous other projects in progress related to service, including looking at 
performance in a number of low-performing districts across the country. We are 
evaluating the operational impacts of embargoes, where the Postal Service stopped 
accepting mail at certain overwhelmed facilities during the past holiday mailing season. 
The OIG will soon release a report that analyzes whether postal changes to collection 
box removals and temporary closures of post offices inadvertently impacted certain 
demographic groups disproportionately. 
    
We are analyzing service performance along the entire mail flow ― processing, 
transportation, and delivery ― to identify where failures commonly occur. In addition, we 
are evaluating the Postal Service’s preparedness for the upcoming holiday season, 
looking at whether it is acquiring enough facilities and deploying necessary equipment 
in response to anticipated volumes. 
Electric Vehicles 
The Postal Service has entered into a contract to purchase up to 165,000 next-
generation delivery vehicles over 10 years. The contract allows the Postal Service to 
choose the number of vehicles that will be electric. The Postal Service has said it can 
only commit to a small portion, perhaps as low as 10 percent, under its current budget. 
However, it has said it could electrify more of its fleet if it receives additional funds from 
Congress.

We support the Postal Service’s efforts to add electric vehicles to its fleet. In 2009, we 
found the use of electric vehicles for Postal Service deliveries was operationally feasible 
and could provide a valuable opportunity for the nation to test electric vehicles 
nationwide. Even at that time, we found the Postal Service would likely need 
government funds to purchase electric vehicles.5  We recently started a new project to 
identify the opportunities and challenges of the Postal Service’s transition to electric 
vehicles.  
 
We are proud of the work we have done to protect postal customers and help improve 
the efficiency and effectiveness of the Postal Service. Additional funds will allow us to 
expand our oversight role in alignment with upcoming and ongoing postal changes.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify and discuss our budget and our work. I am 
happy to answer any questions.

Testimony of 
 
Janet L. Yellen 
Secretary 
U.S. Department of the Treasury 
 
Before the 
Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government 
Committee on Appropriations 
United States Senate 
 
June 23, 2021 
 
 
   
Chairman Van Hollen, Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, thank you for inviting me to join you today. I 
look forward to your questions, but first, I want to briefly discuss the state of our economy and the 
state of the Treasury Department. Because I believe one depends on the other.  
When I took office back in January, the most urgent problem confronting our economy was 
obviously the pandemic: helping people make it to the other side of the crisis and ensuring they were 
met there by a robust recovery. Thanks to this Congress – and its passage of the American Rescue 
Plan – I believe we are well on our way toward that goal.  
However, the ARP and its predecessor legislation are not self-executing. As you know, in order for 
relief dollars to effectively reach their intended targets, we have to stand up and manage new federal 
programs.  
Treasury has been tasked with much of this work. We are proud to do it.  But our challenge is that 
while our portfolio has grown to match the urgency of this moment, our annual budget has not grown 
in tandem, and the funding provided to administer new programs is temporary.  
Not accounting for inflation, our annual budget is still at the same enacted level as 2010, and critical 
policy offices – like Domestic Finance, Economic Policy, and Tax Policy – have seen their budgets 
cut by as much as 20 percent since 2016.  
The mismatch is very stark when you take a moment to scan the new bodies of work we’ve 
undertaken.  
•  Treasury has built a $350 billion program to help state, local, and tribal governments start 
operating normally again.  
 
•  The CERTS program will provide $2 billion to bus and ferry companies.  
 
•  There are two separate multi-billion-dollar programs to help people pay their rent and mortgages.  
 
•  And of course, Treasury administers economic impact payments. The IRS entered the pandemic 
as an agency that processes tax filings and returns once a year – and managed to marshal its 
forces to disburse more than 460 million payments totaling approximately $800 billion across 
three separate tranches.  
 
•  Now, the IRS is preparing to make monthly payments of the expanded child tax credit to families 
of more than 88% of American children.  
 
Our team has done valiant work implementing these programs with the resources at our disposal. But 
we cannot continue to be good stewards of this recovery – and tackle the new bodies of work that 
Congress assigns to us in the years beyond – with a budget that was designed for 2010.  
Our Administration has released its formal budget, and there are several critical areas where funding 
is needed.  
For instance, the Financial Crimes and Enforcement Network – FinCEN – is tasked with building a 
massive database that collects and secures beneficial ownership information, but Congress has not 
yet provided any funding to do it.  
Then there are the Community Development Financial Institutions. Congress has dramatically 
expanded funding for CDFIs with supplemental appropriations – and rightly so. These institutions 
are very effective at injecting capital into areas the financial sector hasn’t traditionally served well.  
However, it is challenging for the CDFI Fund to distribute greater resources and scale these programs 
without additional administrative funding.  
The IRS is in need of additional resources, too.  Over the next ten years, the American people could 
see roughly $7 trillion dollars fall through the cracks of our tax system. Why? Because many of the 
country’s wealthiest taxpayers do not pay their full tax bill, and the IRS is not nearly staffed up 
enough to ensure compliance. Today, the IRS has fewer auditors than at any time since World War II.  
Our proposal would give the IRS the funding it needs. For FY 2022, it includes $13.2 billion from 
discretionary appropriations, plus $417 million for the first year of a program integrity allocation 
adjustment as part of the multi-year American Families Plan. 
Let me just say one final word about the IRS: Many of you have expressed concern about the recent 
ProPublica report. I am deeply troubled by it, as well.  It is important to stress that an unauthorized 
disclosure of taxpayer information is a crime, and that it has been referred to the FBI, federal 
prosecutors, and Treasury Department oversight authorities. We don’t yet know what occurred—but 
all is being done to get to the bottom of this criminal activity. And we will be sure to update you as 
we learn more.  
 
With that, I’m happy to take your questions.

________________________________________________ 
 
 
Good morning, Chairwoman Shaheen, Ranking Member Moran, and Members of the 
Subcommittee.  I am honored to be here, representing the men and women of the FBI.  Our 
people — nearly 37,000 of them — are the heart of the Bureau.  I am proud of their service and 
their commitment to our mission.  Every day, they tackle their jobs with perseverance, 
professionalism, and integrity – sometimes at the greatest of costs.  
 
Earlier this year, two of our agents made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.  
Special Agents Dan Alfin and Laura Schwartzenberger left home to carry out the mission they 
signed up for – to keep the American people safe.  They were executing a federal court-ordered 
search warrant in a violent crimes against children investigation in Sunrise, Florida, when they 
were shot and killed.  Three other agents were also wounded that day.  We’ll be forever grateful 
for their commitment and their dedication – for their last full measure of devotion to the people 
they served and defended.  We will always honor their sacrifice.  
   
           Despite the many challenges our FBI workforce has faced, I am immensely proud of 
their dedication to protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.  Our country 
has faced unimaginable challenges this past year.  Yet, through it all, whether it was coming to 
the aid of our partners during the Capitol siege and committing all of our resources to ensuring 
that those involved in that brutal assault on our Democracy are brought to justice, the 
proliferation of terrorist violence moving at the speed of social media, abhorrent hate crimes, 
COVID-19 related fraud and misinformation, the increasing threat of cyber intrusions and state-
sponsored economic espionage, malign foreign influence and interference, the scourge of opioid 
trafficking and abuse, or human trafficking and crimes against children, the women and men of 
the FBI have unwaveringly stood at the ready and taken it upon themselves to tackle any and all 
challenges thrown their way.   
 
 
 
 
  Today, I appear before you on behalf of the men and women who tackle these threats 
and challenges every day. I am extremely proud of their service and commitment to the FBI’s 
mission and to ensuring the safety and security of communities throughout our nation. On their 
behalf, I would like to express my appreciation for the support you have given them in the past, 
ask for your continued support in the future, and pledge to be the best possible stewards of the 
resources you provide. I would like to begin by providing a brief overview of the FBI’s FY 
2022 budget request, and then follow with a short discussion of key threats and challenges that 
we face, both as a nation and as an organization. 
 
 
FY 2022 Budget Overview 
 
The FY 2022 budget request proposes a total of $10.28 billion in direct budget authority to 
carry out the FBI’s national security, criminal law enforcement, and criminal justice services 
missions. The request includes a total of $10.21 billion for Salaries and Expenses, which will 
support 36,149 positions (13,414 Special Agents, 3,216 Intelligence Analysts, and 19,519 
professional staff), and $61.9 million for Construction. The request includes six program 
enhancements totaling $160.73 million. These enhancements are proposed to meet critical 
requirements and close gaps in operational capabilities, including: $45.0 million for additional 
personnel and tools to investigate the threat posed by Domestic Violent Extremists (“DVEs”), 
receive and process tips from the public, and perform watchlisting and screening activities; 
$40.0 million to enhance cyber investigative capabilities; $18.8 million to mitigate threats from 
foreign intelligence services; $25.5 million to support the expansion of Federal jurisdiction for 
crimes committed on tribal lands in response to the McGirt Supreme Court case; $6.2 million to 
support infrastructure needs related to Federal Task Force Officer (“TFO”) use of Body Worn 
Cameras; $15.23 million to enhance the FBI’s cybersecurity posture and protect internal 
networks; and $10.0 million to maintain facilities on the FBI’s Quantico campus.  
 
 
Key Threats and Challenges 
 
This Committee has provided critical resources for the FBI to become what it is today 
— a threat-focused, intelligence-driven organization. Our nation continues to face a multitude 
of serious and evolving threats ranging from homegrown violent extremists to hostile foreign 
intelligence services and operatives; from sophisticated cyber-based attacks to internet-
facilitated sexual exploitation of children; from violent gangs and criminal organizations to 
public corruption and corporate fraud. Keeping pace with these threats is a significant challenge 
for the FBI. As an organization, we must be able to stay current with constantly evolving 
technologies. Our adversaries — terrorists, foreign intelligence services, and criminals — take 
advantage of modern technology, including the Internet and social media, to facilitate illegal 
activities, recruit followers, encourage terrorist attacks and other illicit actions, and to disperse 
information on building improvised explosive devices and other means to attack the U.S. The 
breadth of these threats and challenges are as complex as any time in our history. And the 
 
- 2 -  
 
 
consequences of not responding to and countering threats and challenges have never been 
greater.  
 
The support of this Committee in helping the FBI do its part in facing and thwarting 
these threats and challenges is greatly appreciated. That support is allowing us to establish 
strong capabilities and capacities for assessing threats, sharing intelligence, leveraging key 
technologies, and — in some respects, most importantly — hiring some of the best to serve as 
Special Agents, Intelligence Analysts, and professional staff. We have built and are 
continuously enhancing a workforce that possesses the skills and knowledge to deal with the 
complex threats and challenges we face today — and tomorrow. We are building a leadership 
cadre that views change and transformation as a positive tool for keeping the FBI focused on the 
key threats facing our nation.  
 
Today’s FBI is a national security and law enforcement organization that uses, collects, 
and shares intelligence in everything we do. Each FBI employee understands that, to defeat the 
key threats facing our nation, we must constantly strive to be more efficient and more effective. 
Just as our adversaries continue to evolve, so, too, must the FBI. We live in a time of acute and 
persistent terrorist and criminal threats to our national security, our economy, and indeed our 
communities. These diverse threats underscore the complexity and breadth of the FBI’s 
mission: to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States. 
 
 
National Security 
 
Capitol Violence 
 
  First and foremost, I want to assure you, your staff, and the American people that the 
FBI has deployed our full investigative resources and is working closely with our federal, State, 
local, Tribal, and territorial partners to aggressively pursue those involved in criminal activity 
during the events of January 6, 2021.  We are working closely with our federal, state, and local 
law enforcement partners, as well as private sector partners, to identify those responsible for the 
violence and destruction of property at the U.S. Capitol building who showed blatant and 
appalling disregard for our institutions of government and the orderly administration of the 
democratic process. 
  
  FBI Special Agents, Intelligence Analysts, and professional staff have been hard at work 
gathering evidence, sharing intelligence, and working with federal prosecutors to bring charges 
against the individuals involved.  As we have said consistently, we do not and will not tolerate 
violent extremists who use the guise of First Amendment-protected activity to engage in violent 
criminal activity.  Thus far, the FBI has arrested hundreds of individuals with regards to rioting, 
assault on a federal officer, property crimes violations, and conspiracy charges, and the work 
continues.   
 
 
- 3 -  
 
 
  Overall, the FBI assesses that the January 6th siege of the Capitol Complex 
demonstrates a willingness by some to use violence against the government in furtherance of 
their political and social goals.  This ideologically motivated violence underscores the symbolic 
nature of the National Capital Region and the willingness of some Domestic Violent Extremists 
to travel to events in this area and violently engage law enforcement and their perceived 
adversaries.  The American people should rest assured that we will continue to work to hold 
accountable those individuals who participated in the violent breach of the Capitol on January 
6th, and any others who attempt to use violence to intimidate, coerce, or influence the American 
people or affect the conduct of our government.  
 
Top Terrorism Threats 
 
  As has been stated multiple times in the past, preventing terrorist attacks, from any 
place, by any actor, remains the FBI’s top priority.  The nature of the threat posed by terrorism 
– both international terrorism (“IT”) and domestic terrorism (“DT”) – continues to evolve. 
 
  The greatest terrorism threat to our Homeland is posed by lone actors or small cells who 
typically radicalize online and look to attack soft targets with easily accessible weapons.  We 
see these threats manifested within both Domestic Violent Extremists (“DVEs”) and 
Homegrown Violent Extremists (“HVEs”), two distinct threats, both of which are located 
primarily in the United States and typically radicalize and mobilize to violence on their own.  
Individuals who commit violent criminal acts in furtherance of social or political goals 
stemming from domestic influences – some of which include racial or ethnic bias, or anti-
government or anti-authority sentiments – are described as DVEs, whereas HVEs are 
individuals who are inspired primarily by global jihad but are not receiving individualized 
direction from Foreign Terrorist Organizations (“FTOs”). 
 
Domestic and Homegrown Violent Extremists are often motivated and inspired by a mix 
of socio-political, ideological, and personal grievances against their targets, and more recently 
have focused on accessible targets to include civilians, law enforcement and the military, 
symbols or members of the U.S. Government, houses of worship, retail locations, and mass 
public gatherings.  Selecting these types of soft targets, in addition to the insular nature of their 
radicalization and mobilization to violence and limited discussions with others regarding their 
plans, increases the challenge faced by law enforcement to detect and disrupt the activities of 
lone actors before they occur. 
 
The top threat we face from DVEs continues to be from those we categorize as Racially 
or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists (“RMVEs”), largely those who advocate for the 
superiority of the white race, who were the primary source of lethal attacks perpetrated by 
DVEs in 2018 and 2019.  It is important to note that we have also recently seen an increase in 
fatal DVE attacks perpetrated by Anti-Government or Anti-Authority Violent Extremists, 
specifically Militia Violent Extremists and Anarchist Violent Extremists.  Anti-Government or 
Anti-Authority Violent Extremists were responsible for three of the four lethal DVE attacks in 
 
- 4 -  
 
 
2020.  Also, in 2020, we saw the first lethal attack committed by an Anarchist Violent Extremist 
in over 20 years.  
 
  Consistent with our mission, the FBI does not investigate First Amendment-protected 
speech or association, peaceful protests, or political activity.  The FBI holds sacred the rights of 
individuals to peacefully exercise their First Amendment freedoms.  Non-violent protests are 
signs of a healthy democracy, not an ailing one.  Regardless of their specific ideology, the FBI 
will aggressively pursue those who seek to hijack legitimate First Amendment-protected 
activity by engaging in violent criminal activity such as the destruction of property and violent 
assaults on law enforcement officers that we witnessed on January 6th and during protests 
throughout the U.S. during the summer of 2020 and beyond.  In other words, we will actively 
pursue the opening of FBI investigations when an individual uses – or threatens the use of – 
force, violence, or coercion, in violation of federal law and in the furtherance of social or 
political goals. 
 
The FBI assesses HVEs are the greatest, most immediate IT threat to the Homeland.  As 
I have described, HVEs are located in and radicalized primarily in the United States, who are 
not receiving individualized direction from global jihad-inspired FTOs but are inspired largely 
by the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (“ISIS”) and al-Qa’ida to commit violence.  An 
HVE’s lack of a direct connection with an FTO, ability to rapidly mobilize without detection, 
and use of encrypted communications pose significant challenges to our ability to proactively 
identify and disrupt them.  
 
  The FBI remains concerned that FTOs, such as ISIS and al-Qa’ida, intend to carry out or 
inspire large-scale attacks in the United States.  Despite its loss of physical territory in Iraq and 
Syria, ISIS remains relentless in its campaign of violence against the United States and our 
partners – both here at home and overseas.  To this day, ISIS continues to aggressively promote 
its hate-fueled rhetoric and attract like-minded violent extremists with a willingness to conduct 
attacks against the United States and our interests abroad.  ISIS’ successful use of social media 
and messaging applications to attract individuals seeking a sense of belonging is of continued 
concern to us.  Like other foreign terrorist groups, ISIS advocates for lone offender attacks in 
the United States and Western countries via videos and other English language propaganda that 
have at times specifically advocated for attacks against civilians, the military, law enforcement 
and intelligence community personnel. 
 
  Al-Qa’ida maintains its desire to both conduct and inspire large-scale, spectacular 
attacks.  Because continued pressure has degraded some of the group’s senior leadership, in the 
near term, we assess al-Qa’ida is more likely to continue to focus on cultivating its international 
affiliates and supporting small-scale, readily achievable attacks in regions such as East and 
West Africa.  Over the past year, propaganda from al-Qa’ida leaders continued to seek to inspire 
individuals to conduct their own attacks in the United States and other Western nations.  
 
Iran and its global proxies and partners, including Iraqi Shia militant groups, continue to 
attack and plot against the United States and our allies throughout the Middle East in response 
 
- 5 -  
 
 
to U.S. pressure.  Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (“IRGC-QF”) 
continues to provide support to militant resistance groups and terrorist organizations.  Iran also 
continues to support Lebanese Hizballah and other terrorist groups.  Lebanese Hizballah has 
sent operatives to build terrorist infrastructures worldwide.  The arrests of individuals in the 
United States allegedly linked to Lebanese Hizballah’s main overseas terrorist arm, and their 
intelligence collection and procurement efforts, demonstrate Lebanese Hizballah’s interest in 
long-term contingency planning activities here in the Homeland.  Lebanese Hizballah Secretary-
General Hasan Nasrallah also has threatened retaliation for the death of IRGC-QF Commander 
Qassem Soleimani. 
 
  As an organization, we continually adapt and rely heavily on the strength of our federal, 
state, local, Tribal, territorial, and international partnerships to combat all terrorist threats to the 
United States and our interests.  To that end, we use all available lawful investigative techniques 
and methods to combat these threats while continuing to collect, analyze, and share intelligence 
concerning the threat posed by violent extremists, in all their forms, who desire to harm 
Americans and U.S. interests.  We will continue to share information and encourage the sharing 
of information among our numerous partners via our Joint Terrorism Task Forces across the 
country, and our Legal Attaché offices around the world. The FBI’s FY 2022 Request includes 
179 positions (including 80 Special Agents, 43 Intelligence Analysts, and 56 professional staff) 
and $45.0 million to counter terrorism and the increasing acts of domestic terrorism occurring 
across the United States. 
 
 
Lawful Access  
 
The problems caused by law enforcement agencies’ inability to access electronic 
evidence continue to grow.  Increasingly, commercial device manufacturers have employed 
encryption in such a manner that only the device users can access the content of the devices.  
This is commonly referred to as “user-only-access” device encryption.  Similarly, more and 
more communications service providers are designing their platforms and apps such that only 
the parties to the communication can access the content.  This is generally known as “end-to-
end” encryption.  The proliferation of end-to-end and user-only-access encryption is a serious 
issue that increasingly limits law enforcement’s ability, even after obtaining a lawful warrant or 
court order, to access critical evidence and information needed to disrupt threats, protect the 
public, and bring perpetrators to justice. 
 
The FBI remains a strong advocate for the wide and consistent use of responsibly-
managed encryption – encryption that providers can decrypt and provide to law enforcement 
when served with a legal order.  Protecting data and privacy in a digitally connected world is a 
top priority for the FBI and the U.S. government, and we believe that promoting encryption is a 
vital part of that mission.  But we have seen that the broad application of end-to-end and user-
only-access encryption adds negligible security advantages.  It does have a negative effect on 
law enforcement’s ability to protect the public.  What we mean when we talk about lawful 
access is putting providers who manage encrypted data in a position to decrypt it and provide it 
 
- 6 -  
 
 
to us in response to legal process.  We are not asking for, and do not want, any “backdoor,” that 
is, for encryption to be weakened or compromised so that it can be defeated from the outside by 
law enforcement or anyone else.  Unfortunately, too much of the debate over lawful access has 
revolved around discussions of this “backdoor” straw man instead of what we really want and 
need. 
 
We are deeply concerned with the threat end-to-end and user-only-access encryption 
pose to our ability to fulfill the FBI’s duty of protecting the American people from every 
manner of federal crime, from cyber-attacks and violence against children to drug trafficking 
and organized crime.  We believe Americans deserve security in every walk of life – in their 
data, their streets, their businesses, and their communities. 
 
End-to-end and user-only-access encryption erode that security against every danger the 
FBI combats.  For example, even with our substantial resources, accessing the content of known 
or suspected terrorists’ data pursuant to court-authorized legal process is increasingly difficult.  
The often-online nature of the terrorist radicalization process, along with the insular nature of 
most of today’s attack plotters, leaves fewer dots for investigators to connect in time to stop an 
attack – and end-to-end and user-only-access encryption increasingly hide even those often 
precious few and fleeting dots.   
 
In one instance, while planning and right up until the eve of the December 6, 2019, 
shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola that killed three U.S. sailors and severely wounded 
eight other Americans, deceased terrorist Mohammed Saeed Al-Shamrani communicated 
undetected with overseas al-Qa’ida terrorists using an end-to-end encrypted app.  Then, after the 
attack, user-only-access encryption prevented the FBI from accessing information contained in 
his phones for several months.  As a result, during the critical time period immediately 
following the shooting and despite obtaining search warrants for the deceased killer’s devices, 
the FBI could not access the information on those phones to identify co-conspirators or 
determine whether they may have been plotting additional attacks.   
 
This problem spans international and domestic terrorism threats.  Like Al-Shamrani, the 
plotters who sought to kidnap the Governor of Michigan late last year used end-to-end 
encrypted apps to hide their communications from law enforcement.  Their plot was only 
disrupted by well-timed human source reporting and the resulting undercover operation.  
Subjects of our investigation into the January 6 Capitol siege used end-to-end encrypted 
communications as well.   
 
We face the same problem in protecting children against violent sexual exploitation.  
End-to-end and user-only-access encryption frequently prevent us from discovering and 
searching for victims.  In particular, providers can send us vital tips that can lead to the rescue 
of a child only when those providers themselves are able to detect and report child exploitation 
being facilitated on their platforms and services.  They cannot do that when their platforms are 
end-to-end encrypted.  For example, while Facebook Messenger and Apple iMessage each 
boasts over one billion users, in 2020, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children 
 
- 7 -  
 
 
(“NCMEC”) received over 20 million tips from Facebook,1 compared to 265 tips from Apple, 
according to NCMEC data and publicly available information.  Apple’s use of end-to-end 
encryption, which blinds it to child sexual abuse material being transmitted through its services, 
likely plays a role in the disparities in reporting between the two companies.  We do not know 
how many children are being harmed across the country as a result of this under-reporting by 
Apple and other end-to-end providers.   
 
When we are able to open investigations, end-to-end and user-only-access encryption 
makes it much more difficult to bring perpetrators to justice.  Much evidence of crimes against 
children, just like many other kinds of crime today, exists primarily in electronic form.  If we 
cannot obtain that critical electronic evidence, our efforts are frequently hamstrung. 
This problem is not just limited to federal investigations.  Our State and local law 
enforcement partners have been consistently advising the FBI that they, too, are experiencing 
similar end-to-end and user-only-access encryption challenges, which are now being felt across 
the full range of State and local criminal law enforcement.  Many report that even relatively 
unsophisticated criminal groups, like street gangs, are frequently using user-only-access 
encrypted smartphones and end-to-end encrypted communications apps to shield their activities 
from detection or disruption.  As this problem becomes more and more acute for State and local 
law enforcement, the advanced technical resources needed to address even a single investigation 
involving end-to-end and user-only-access encryption will continue to diminish and ultimately 
overwhelm State and local capacity to investigate even common crimes. 
 
Cyber 
 
In 2020, nation-state and criminal cyber actors took advantage of people and networks 
made more vulnerable by the sudden shift of our personal and professional lives online due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, targeting those searching for personal protective equipment, worried 
about stimulus checks, and conducting vaccine research. 
 
Throughout the last year, the FBI has seen a wider-than-ever range of cyber actors 
threaten Americans’ safety, security, and confidence in our digitally connected world.  But these 
threats will not disappear when the pandemic ends.  Cyber-criminal syndicates and nation-states 
keep innovating ways to compromise our networks and maximize the reach and impact of their 
operations, such as by selling malware as a service or by targeting vendors as a way to access 
scores of victims by hacking just one provider. 
 
These criminals and nation-states believe that they can compromise our networks, steal 
our property, and hold our critical infrastructure at risk without incurring any risk themselves.  
In the last year alone, we have seen – and have publicly called out – China, North Korea, and 
Russia for using cyber operations to target U.S. COVID-19 vaccines and research.  We have 
seen the far-reaching disruptive impact a serious supply-chain compromise can have through the

SolarWinds intrusions, conducted by the Russian SVR.  We have seen China working to obtain 
controlled defense technology and developing the ability to use cyber means to complement any 
future real-world conflict.  We have seen Iran use cyber means to try to sow divisions and 
undermine our elections, targeting voters before the November election and threatening election 
officials after.  
 
As dangerous as nation-states are, we do not have the luxury of focusing on them alone.  
In the past year, we also have seen cyber criminals target hospitals, medical centers, and 
educational institutions for theft or ransomware.  Such incidents affecting medical centers have 
led to the interruption of computer networks and systems that put patients’ lives at an increased 
risk at a time when America faces its most dire public health crisis in generations. And we have 
seen criminal groups targeting critical infrastructure for ransom, causing massive disruption to 
our daily lives. 
 
We are also seeing dark web vendors who sell capabilities in exchange for 
cryptocurrency increase the difficulty of stopping what would once have been less dangerous 
offenders.  What was once a ring of unsophisticated criminals now has the tools to paralyze 
entire hospitals, police departments, and businesses with ransomware.  It is not that individual 
hackers alone have necessarily become much more sophisticated, but — unlike previously — 
they are able to rent sophisticated capabilities. 
 
We have to make it harder and more painful for hackers and criminals to do what they 
are doing.  That is why I announced a new FBI cyber strategy last year, using the FBI’s role as 
the lead federal agency with law enforcement and intelligence responsibilities to not only 
pursue our own actions, but to work seamlessly with our domestic and international partners to 
defend their networks, attribute malicious activity, sanction bad behavior, and take the fight to 
our adversaries overseas.  We must impose consequences on cyber adversaries and use our 
collective law enforcement and intelligence capabilities to do so through joint and enabled 
operations sequenced for maximum impact.  And we must continue to work with the 
Department of State and other key agencies to ensure that our foreign partners are able and 
willing to cooperate in our efforts to bring the perpetrators of cybercrime to justice. 
 
An example of this approach is the international takedown in January 2021 of the 
Emotet botnet, which enabled a network of cyber criminals to cause hundreds of millions of 
dollars in damages to government, educational, and corporate networks.  The FBI used 
sophisticated techniques, our unique legal authorities, and, most importantly, our worldwide 
partnerships to significantly disrupt the malware.   
 
A few months ago, cybersecurity companies including Microsoft disclosed that hackers 
were using previously unknown vulnerabilities related to Microsoft Exchange software to 
access email servers that companies physically keep on their premises rather than in the cloud. 
These “zero day” vulnerabilities allowed the actors to potentially exploit victim networks, 
engaging in activities such as grabbing login credentials, installing malicious programs to send 
commands to the victim network, and stealing emails in bulk. The FBI first put out a joint 
 
- 9 -  
 
 
advisory in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) to give network defenders the technical information 
they needed to mitigate the vulnerability.  However, while many infected system owners 
successfully removed the web shells others were not able to do so. That left many systems 
vulnerable to adversaries who could continue to steal information, encrypt data for ransom, or 
potentially even execute a destructive attack.  In response, through a court-authorized operation 
in partnership with the private sector, we were able to copy and remove malicious web shells 
from hundreds of vulnerable computers in the U.S. running Microsoft Exchange Server 
software. This is another example of how the FBI used its unique authorities, in this case, court-
issued legal process, and its partnerships with the private sector to have tangible, real-world 
impact on the problem. 
 
We took upwards of 1,100 actions against cyber adversaries last year, including arrests, 
criminal charges, convictions, dismantlements, and disruptions, and enabled many more actions 
through our dedicated partnerships with the private sector, foreign partners, and at the federal, 
State, and local entities. 
 
We have been putting a lot of energy and resources into all of those partnerships, 
especially with the private sector.  We are working hard to push important threat information to 
network defenders, but we have also been making it as easy as possible for the private sector to 
share important information with us.  For example, we are emphasizing to the private sector 
how we keep our presence unobtrusive in the wake of a breach; how we protect information that 
companies, and universities share with us, and commit to providing useful feedback; and how 
we coordinate with our government partners so that we are speaking with one voice.  But we 
need the private sector to do its part, too.  We need the private sector to come forward to warn 
us — and warn us quickly — when they see malicious cyber activity.  We also need the private 
sector to work with us when we warn them that they are being targeted.  The recent examples of 
significant cyber incident — SolarWinds, HAFNIUM, the pipeline incident — only emphasize 
what I have been saying for a long time:  The government cannot protect against cyber threats 
on its own.  We need a whole-of-society approach that matches the scope of the danger.  There 
is really no other option for defending a country where nearly all of our critical infrastructure, 
personal data, intellectual property, and network infrastructure sits in private hands. 
 
In summary, the FBI is engaged in a myriad of efforts to combat cyber threats, from 
improving threat identification and information sharing inside and outside of the government to 
developing and retaining new talent, to examining the way we operate to disrupt and defeat 
these threats. We take all potential threats to public and private sector systems seriously and will 
continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace. The FY 
2022 Request includes 155 positions (including 52 Special Agents, 57 Intelligence Analysts, 
and 46 Professional Staff) and $40.0 million to enhance cyber information-sharing abilities and 
increase cyber tools and capacities.  The Request also includes 22 positions and $15.23 million 
to help protect internal FBI networks.

Foreign Influence 
 
Our nation is confronting multifaceted foreign threats seeking to both influence our 
national policies and public opinion, and cause harm to our national dialogue.  The FBI and our 
interagency partners remain concerned about, and focused on, the covert and overt influence 
measures used by certain adversaries in their attempts to sway U.S. voters’ preferences and 
perspectives, shift U.S. policies, increase discord in the United States, and undermine the 
American people’s confidence in our democratic processes.  
 
Foreign influence operations — which include subversive, undeclared, coercive, and 
criminal actions by foreign governments to influence U.S. political sentiment or public 
discourse or interfere in our processes themselves — are not a new problem.  But the 
interconnectedness of the modern world, combined with the anonymity of the Internet, have 
changed the nature of the threat and how the FBI and its partners must address it.  Foreign 
influence operations have taken many forms and used many tactics over the years.  Most widely 
reported these days are attempts by adversaries — hoping to reach a wide swath of Americans 
covertly from outside the United States — to use false personas and fabricated stories on social 
media platforms to discredit U.S. individuals and institutions.  
 
The FBI is the lead federal agency responsible for investigating foreign influence 
operations.  In the fall of 2017, we established the Foreign Influence Task Force (“FITF”) to 
identify and counteract malign foreign influence operations targeting the United States.  The 
FITF is led by the Counterintelligence Division and is comprised of agents, analysts, and 
professional staff from the Counterintelligence, Cyber, Counterterrorism, and Criminal 
Investigative Divisions.  It is specifically charged with identifying and combating foreign 
influence operations targeting democratic institutions and values inside the United States.  In all 
instances, the FITF strives to protect democratic institutions; develop a common operating 
picture; raise adversaries’ costs; and reduce their overall asymmetric advantage.  
 
The FITF brings the FBI’s national security and traditional criminal investigative 
expertise under one umbrella to prevent foreign influence in our elections.  This better enables 
us to frame the threat, to identify connections across programs, to aggressively investigate as 
appropriate, and — importantly — to be more agile.  Coordinating closely with our partners and 
leveraging relationships we have developed in the technology sector, we had several instances 
where we were able to quickly relay threat indicators that those companies used to take swift 
action, blocking budding abuse of their platforms. 
 
        Following the 2018 midterm elections, we reviewed the threat and the effectiveness of 
our coordination and outreach.  As a result of this review, we further expanded the scope of the 
FITF.  Previously, our efforts to combat malign foreign influence focused solely on the threat 
posed by Russia.  Utilizing lessons learned since 2018, the FITF widened its aperture to 
confront malign foreign operations of China, Iran, and other global adversaries.  To address this 
expanding focus and wider set of adversaries and influence efforts, we have also added 
resources to maintain permanent “surge” capability on election and foreign influence threats. 
 
- 11 -  
 
 
 
These additional resources were also devoted to working with U.S. Government partners 
on two documents regarding the U.S. Government’s analysis of foreign efforts to influence or 
interfere with the 2020 Election.  The reports are separate but complementary.  The first report 
— referred to as the 1a report and authored by the Office of the Director of National 
Intelligence — outlines the intentions of foreign adversaries with regard to influencing and 
interfering in the election but does not evaluate impact.  The second report — referred to as the 
1b report and authored by the Department of Justice, including the FBI, and Department of 
Homeland Security, including the CISA — evaluates the impact of foreign government activity 
on the security or integrity of election infrastructure or infrastructure pertaining to political 
organizations, candidates, or campaigns.2 
 
The main takeaway from both reports is there is no evidence — not through intelligence 
collection on the foreign actors themselves, not through physical security and cybersecurity 
monitoring of voting systems across the country, not through post-election audits, and not 
through any other means — that a foreign government or other actors compromised election 
infrastructure to manipulate election results. 
 
While the 2020 election is over, the FBI will not stop working with our partners to 
impose costs on adversaries who have or are seeking to influence or interfere in our elections.   
 
The FY 2022 Request includes 28 positions (including 7 Special Agents, 4 Intelligence 
Analysts, and 17 Professional Staff) and $18.8 million to help combat the threats posed by 
foreign, and potentially hostile, intelligence services and other foreign government actors. 
 
 
Criminal Threats 
 
We face many criminal threats, from complex white-collar fraud in the financial, health 
care, and housing sectors to transnational and regional organized criminal enterprises to violent 
crime and public corruption. Criminal organizations — domestic and international — and 
individual criminal activity represent a significant threat to our security and safety in 
communities across the Nation. 
 
 
Violent Crime 
 
Violent crimes and gang activities exact a high toll on individuals and communities. 
Many of today’s gangs are sophisticated and well organized, and use violence to control 
neighborhoods and boost their illegal money-making activities, which include robbery, drug and 
gun trafficking, fraud, extortion, and prostitution rings. These gangs do not limit their illegal 
activities to single jurisdictions or communities. The FBI is able to work across such lines, 
 
2These reports are required by sections 1(a) and 1(b) of Executive Order 13,848. 
 
- 12 -  
 
 
which is vital to the fight against violent crime in big cities and small towns across the Nation. 
Every day, FBI special agents work in partnership with federal, State, local, and Tribal officers 
and deputies on joint task forces and individual investigations.  
 
Similar to the FBI’s work combatting gangs, the FBI also investigates the most serious 
crimes in Indian Country—such as murder, child sexual and physical abuse, violent assaults, 
drug trafficking, public corruption, financial crimes, and Indian gaming violations. As you are 
aware, there are 574 federally recognized American Indian Tribes in the United States, and the 
FBI has federal law enforcement responsibility on nearly 200 Indian reservations. This federal 
jurisdiction is shared concurrently with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (“BIA”), Office of Justice 
Services; the FBI works very closely with BIA and other Federal, state, and tribal partners 
across the United States on crimes in Indian Country.   
 
Recently, the FBI’s work in Indian Country in Oklahoma increased significantly due to 
the July 9, 2020, Supreme Court ruling in McGirt v. Oklahoma, which determined that the 
territorial boundaries of the Muscogee Creek Nation (“MCN”) fall under federal Indian Country 
jurisdiction, making the FBI the responsible law enforcement agency for offenses committed by 
or victimizing a tribal member.  The principles of the McGirt decision also apply to the status of 
the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole tribal territories in Oklahoma.  Combined, all 
five reservation territories encompass approximately 32,000 square miles, or 45 percent of the 
State of Oklahoma.  The total population within the combined borders is roughly 1.9 million, of 
which approximately 420,000 are enrolled tribal members.    
 
This increase in FBI jurisdiction poses significant and long-term operational and public 
safety risks given the challenges associated with the increased number of violent criminal cases 
now under federal jurisdiction within Oklahoma’s IC territory. Since this decision, the FBI’s 
Oklahoma City Field Office (“OC”) has seen a drastic increase in the total number of Indian 
Country investigations and now has the FBI’s largest investigative responsibility.  From July 9, 
2020 to March 23, 2021, FBI OC opened nearly 1,000 Indian Country investigations (most of 
them adopted from previous State actions), prioritizing cases involving the most violent 
offenders who pose the most serious risk to the public. As a point of comparison, the FBI’s 
other 55 Field Offices opened a combined total of 1,255 IC investigations during the same 
period, with FBI Minneapolis, the next largest Indian Country office behind FBI OC, opening 
over 300 cases. This workload data primarily represents the cases from the MCN reservation 
alone; this workload is expected to increase substantially given the additions of the Cherokee 
and Chickasaw reservations in mid-March and the Choctaw and Seminole reservations in April. 
The FBI is anticipating 2,500 new cases next year and approximately 5,000 adopted cases from 
previously adjudicated in Oklahoma state courts which were overturned either by McGirt or 
subsequent Oklahoma court decisions applying McGirt.   
 
To effectively conduct these investigations, the FBI has conducted temporary duty 
(“TDY”) rotations of 140 Special Agents, Investigative Analysts, Victims Specialists and other 
professional staff to the Muskogee and Tulsa RAs, the offices most impacted by the decision. 
The FBI has also expanded State, local, and tribal participation on task forces to 230 Task Force 
 
- 13 -  
 
 
Officers from 32 agencies to assist with initial response and investigative efforts. The U.S. 
Attorney’s Offices in the Eastern District of Oklahoma and the Northern District of Oklahoma 
also increased their staffing.  In order to support the U.S. Attorneys’ effective prosecution of 
these crimes, the FBI must have the capability to sustain an enhanced presence in FBI OC.  As 
such, the FY 2022 Request includes $25.5 million to support the surge in personnel to meet the 
immediate need, as the situation on the ground continues to evolve.  In addition, the FY 2022 
Request includes $6.2 million to fulfill the Department of Justice’s October 2020, policy on Use 
of Body-Worn Cameras by Federally Deputized Task Force Officers.   
 
 
Conclusion  
 
Finally, the strength of any organization is its people.  The threats we face as a nation 
have never been greater or more diverse and the expectations placed on the FBI have never been 
higher.  Our fellow citizens look to the FBI to protect the United States from all of those threats, 
and the men and women of the FBI continue to meet and exceed those expectations, every day.  
I want to thank them for their dedicated service. 
 
Chairwoman Shaheen, Ranking Member Moran, and Members of the Subcommittee, 
thank you for the opportunity to testify today.  I am happy to answer any questions you might

COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, VETERANS AFFAIRS, AND 
RELATE AGENCIES 
UNITED STATES SENATE 
 
A REVIEW OF THE FY 2022 BUDGET AND FY 2023 ADVANCE APPROPRIATIONS 
REQUESTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 
 
JUNE 23, 2021 
 
Chairman Heinrich, Senator Boozman, and distinguished Members of the 
Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today in support of the 
President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 Budget and FY 2023 Advance Appropriations 
Request for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and for your longstanding support 
of Veterans and their families. I am accompanied by Mr. Jon Rychalski, Assistant 
Secretary for Management and Chief Financial Officer. 
 
President Biden defined our country’s most sacred obligation as preparing and 
equipping the troops we send into harm’s way and then caring for them and their 
families when they return. It is the honor of my lifetime to join the dedicated, highly 
skilled professionals who constitute the VA workforce—many of them Veterans 
themselves. VA employees are committed to serving Veterans, their families, caregivers 
and survivors. The President’s FY 2022 Budget Request reflects this commitment. This 
budget request will ensure VA is moving swiftly and smartly into the future, with much-
needed monetary investments in our most successful and vital programs.  This Budget 
ensures all Veterans, including women Veterans, Veterans of color, and LGBTQ+ 
Veterans, receive the care and benefits they have earned and prioritizes Veteran 
homelessness, suicide prevention outreach and caregiver support. 
 
VA faces critical challenges, many of them made even more complex by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Getting our Veterans through this pandemic continues to be one 
of our department’s highest priorities. As our country re-opens after 14 months of 
closures and necessary restrictions on some activities, all of us at VA remain focused 
on the robust clinical response to COVID-19. Our efforts include expanding COVID-19 
vaccinations; ensuring Veterans stay connected to longitudinal care through telehealth 
and in person care where necessary; keeping employees safe; and, planning how to 
address the pandemic’s future impacts on Veterans and our workforce in the health 
care, benefits and cemetery systems. VA has demonstrated resiliency through this crisis 
by providing continuous services in line with national policy, and we continue to update 
our safety guidelines in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) guidance. 
 
 
 
We encourage every Veteran to be vaccinated as soon as possible. That is why 
we thank Congress for providing additional authorities and we have expanded our 
efforts to include vaccinations for all Veterans, regardless of whether they are enrolled 
or eligible to enroll in VA health care, for Veterans’ spouses, and for Veterans’ 
caregivers, and, most recently, for some 12- to 17-year-olds, including those serving as 
Veteran caregivers and those who qualify as beneficiaries under VA’s Civilian Health 
and Medical Program.  
 
As of June 11, VA has fully vaccinated more than 3 million Veterans, family 
members, caregivers, employees, and federal partners. We are seeing the positive 
results of those efforts. I am honored and delighted to report that VA recorded zero 
deaths from COVID-19 in our facilities on May 24 for the first time in more than a year. 
That is a critically important indicator of significant progress in fighting this pandemic. As 
we prepared for Memorial Day, a time of special significance for us and our Veteran 
communities, we followed CDC guidance and relaxed restrictions at our National 
Cemeteries which allowed us to remember our fallen heroes in person again this year. 
We are seeking input from VA employees about how we can safely and confidently 
bring our teams back to work in a manner consistent with CDC guidance and data-
driven facts. We look forward to our continued return to normal operations, while 
recognizing that this pandemic has had an impact on every aspect of daily life for 
Veterans, their families, and all Americans.   
 
Fiscal Year 2022 Budget and 2023 Advance Appropriations 
 
The President’s FY 2022 Budget Request includes $269.9 billion (with medical 
collections), a 10.0% increase above 2021. This includes a discretionary budget request 
of $117.2 billion (with medical collections). The request includes $101.5 billion (with 
collections) for VA medical care, $8.7 billion or 9.4% above the 2021 enacted level. The 
2022 mandatory funding request totals $152.7 billion, an increase of $14.9 billion or 
10.8% above 2021. This funding is in addition to the substantial resources provided in 
the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.  
 
The 2023 Medical Care Advance Appropriations Request includes a 
discretionary funding request of $115.5 billion (with medical care collections). The 2023 
mandatory Advance Appropriations request is $156.6 billion for Veterans benefits 
programs (Compensation and Pensions, Readjustment Benefits, and Veterans 
Insurance and Indemnities).  
 
Strategic Focus 
 
To fulfill our country’s most sacred obligation, every decision I make will be 
determined by whether it increases Veterans’ access to care and benefits and improves 
outcomes for them. I will work tirelessly to rebuild trust and restore VA as the premier 
agency for ensuring the well-being of America’s Veterans through a persistent focus on 
the three core responsibilities of the Department:  
Page 2 of 15 
 
 
 
1.  Providing our Veterans with timely world-class health care; 
2.  Ensuring our Veterans and their families have timely access to their 
benefits; and 
3.  Honoring our Veterans with their final resting place and lasting tributes to 
their service. 
 
Under my leadership, the Department will make it a priority to implement 
management reforms to improve accountability and ensure Veterans receive the care 
and benefits they have earned. In addition to the funding for medical care, this Budget 
includes $3.4 billion for the General Operating Expenses - Veterans Benefits 
Administration (VBA) account, including funds to hire 429 new disability compensation 
claims processors, and $394 million for the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). 
The Budget fully funds operation of the largest integrated health care system in the 
United States, with over 9.2 million enrolled Veterans, provides disability compensation 
benefits to nearly 6 million Veterans and their survivors and administers pension 
benefits for over 350,000 Veterans and their survivors. 
 
In addition to focusing on these three core responsibilities, President Biden also 
tasked me with:  
 
1.  Getting our Veterans through this COVID-19 pandemic;  
2.  Helping our Veterans build civilian lives of opportunity with the education 
and jobs worthy of their skills and talents; 
3.  Ensuring VA welcomes all our Veterans, including women Veterans, 
Veterans of color, and LGBTQ+ Veterans; and Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion are woven into the fabric of the Department;  
4.  Working to eliminate Veteran homelessness and prevent suicide; and 
5.  Keeping faith with our families and caregivers. 
 
Key Challenges:  
 
As VA addresses the numerous challenges brought on or exacerbated by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, we also will need to tackle other longstanding issues that are 
essential to the Department’s ability to sustainably and effectively execute its mission, 
including (1) establishing the right balance of direct care and purchased care, (2) 
delivering timely access to high-quality mental health care, including substance use 
disorder care, and preventing Veteran suicide, (3) increasing support to families and 
caregivers, (4) increasing support for the growing number of women Veterans who 
utilize VA services, (5) providing a whole of government solution to drive progress to 
eliminate Veteran homelessness, (6) improving support for transitioning 
servicemembers through improvements to the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), 
education and job training programs, and (7) addressing an aging medical 
infrastructure.

Establishing the Right Balance of VA and Community Care  
 
Providing Veterans with timely access to high quality health care is essential. VA 
remains committed to a strong, thriving direct VA health care system, augmented by a 
robust and high-quality community care network. We will continue to expand access, 
innovate, and leverage our research and education missions to push the boundaries of 
what is possible in serving our Nation’s Veterans. In short, we will lead – empowering 
each Veteran with the confidence that their trusted system will lead with sustained 
excellence on their behalf and on behalf of future generations of Veterans.  For the 
Veterans listening today: VA is here as a welcoming, steady force ready to help you 
grow your health and well-being with the excellence you expect from us.  
 
Access to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention  
 
VA has made suicide prevention a top clinical priority and is implementing a 
comprehensive public health approach to reach all Veterans. The 2022 Budget Request 
includes $598 million, nearly $287 million above the 2021 enacted level, for existing 
programs dedicated to suicide prevention outreach and related activities, including 
funding to increase the capacity of the Veterans Crisis Line. Funding for mental health 
in total grows to $13.5 billion in 2022, up from $12.0 billion in 2021. Our commitment to 
a proactive, Veteran-centered Whole Health approach is integral to our mental health 
care efforts and includes online and telehealth access strategies. Whole Health can 
help Veterans reconnect with their mission and purpose in life as part of our 
comprehensive approach to reducing risk. Suicide is a complex issue with no single 
cause. Maintaining the integrity of VA’s mental health care system is vitally important, 
but it is not enough. We know some Veterans may not receive any health care services 
from VA, which highlights VA alone cannot end Veteran suicide. This requires a 
nationwide effort. 
 
VA developed the National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide (2018),1 
which laid the foundation for VA’s approach to suicide. This national vision for 
preventing Veteran suicide is grounded in three major tenets in which we firmly believe: 
(1) suicide is preventable, (2) suicide requires a public health approach, combining 
community-based and clinical approaches and (3) everyone has a role to play in suicide 
prevention. While the development of the National Strategy was groundbreaking in 
defining the vision of reaching and serving Veterans within and outside Veterans Health 
Administration (VHA) clinical care, VA moved to translate the vision of the 10-year 
National Strategy into operational plans of actions in: Suicide Prevention 2.0 (SP 2.0) 
combined with the Suicide Prevention Now initiative. 
 
My promise to Veterans remains the same: (1) to promote, preserve and restore 
Veterans’ health and well-being, (2) to empower and equip them to achieve their life

goals using a whole health approach and (3) to provide state-of-the-art clinical 
treatments. We will continue to invest and share resources with community 
organizations in the fight against Veteran suicide. We understand Veterans possess 
unique characteristics and experiences related to their military service that may 
increase their risk of suicide. Additionally, Veterans also tend to possess skills and 
protective factors, like resilience and a strong sense of belonging to a group. 
 
Supporting Caregivers 
 
The 2022 request includes $1.4 billion, an increase of $350 million above 2021, 
in funding dedicated to the Caregiver Support Program (CSP). The CSP empowers 
caregivers to provide care and support to Veterans with a wide range of resources 
through the Program of General Caregiver Support Services (PGCSS) and the Program 
of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC). As a result of the John 
S. McCain III, Daniel Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems 
and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018, or the VA MISSION Act of 
2018, VA began a major expansion of PCAFC. 
 
PCAFC expansion rolls out in two phases. The first phase, which began on 
October 1, 2020, expands PCAFC eligibility to include eligible Veterans who incurred or 
aggravated a serious injury in the line of duty on or before May 7, 1975. Effective 
October 1, 2022, the second phase will expand PCAFC eligibility to include eligible 
Veterans who incurred or aggravated a serious injury in the line of duty between May 7, 
1975, and September 11, 2001.  
 
Expansion of this Program was contingent upon the implementation and 
certification of the new IT system, Caregiver Record Management Application 
(CARMA). CARMA automates manual processes and integrates with other VA systems, 
increasing efficiencies and effectiveness, and allowing for more effective monitoring and 
management of the program for caregivers and VA staff.  
 
CARMA supports consistency through systematic calculations of monthly stipend 
payments and provides a mechanism for CARMA users to identify upcoming 
reassessments of PCAFC participants, among other key functions. A new digital version 
of VA FORM 10-10CG allows online PCAFC applications.  
 
VA also expedited the hiring of key staff with clinical qualifications and 
organizational skills to support program needs, provide a strong infrastructure and 
standardize application processing and adjudication, ensuring consistent eligibility 
decision-making. The expansion funded by this request will support providing training 
and education to over 1,900 field-based staff dedicated to the caregiver program.  CSP 
has already expanded to approximately 1,800 staff. These changes will help ensure 
Veterans and caregivers receive timely, accurate assessments and eligibility 
determinations, as well as an improved customer experience.

Improving Support for Women Veterans 
 
As the number of women Veterans enrolling in VA health care continues to 
increase, VA must be prepared to meet their needs. Women make up 16.5% of today’s 
Active Duty military forces and 19% of National Guard and Reserves. Based on the 
trend, the expected number of women Veterans using VA health care will rise rapidly. 
More women are choosing VA for their health care than ever before, with women 
accounting for over 30% of the increase in Veterans enrolled over the past 5 years. The 
number of women Veterans using VA health care services has more than tripled since 
2001, growing from 159,810 to more than 550,000 today. To support the growing 
number of women Veterans, VA will increase total planned obligations from all funding 
sources for gender-specific care from $630 million in 2021 to $706 million in 2022, an 
increase of $76 million, or 12%.   
 
To address the needs of the growing number of women Veterans who are 
eligible for VA health care, VA is strategically enhancing services and access for women 
Veterans by hiring women’s health personnel nationally to fill any gaps in capacity to 
provide gender specific care — this includes hiring primary care providers, 
gynecologists, mental health care providers and care coordinators across all VISNS so 
that VA is able to fulfill the mission of caring for those we serve. Funds also are 
available for programs such as pelvic floor physical therapy or lactation support. These 
efforts will be sustained by the 2022 request, which includes $105 million for the Office 
of Women’s Health. 
 
Each of the 171 VA medical centers across the United States now has a full-time 
Women Veterans Program Manager tasked with advocating for the health care needs of 
women Veterans. Mini residencies in women’s health with didactic and practicum 
components have been implemented to enhance clinician proficiency. Since 2008, more 
than 7,600 health care providers and nurses have been trained in the local and national 
mini-residency programs and even more have participated in monthly webinars and 
Talent Management System (TMS) trainings, not only developing women’s health 
experts, but also enhancing competency of all clinicians across the system.   
 
Under a new collaboration with the Office of Rural Health, we established a 
pathway for accelerating access to women’s health training for rural primary care 
providers. VHA actively recruits providers with experience in women’s health care to join 
its care team. VHA has launched numerous initiatives to improve access to state-of-the-
art reproductive health services, mental health services and emergency services for 
women Veterans, as well as focusing on enhancing care coordination through 
technological innovations such as registries and mobile applications. 
 
To provide the highest quality of care to women Veterans, VA offers women 
Veterans trained and experienced designated Women’s Health Primary Care Providers 
(WH-PCP). National VA satisfaction and quality data indicate women who are assigned 
to WH-PCPs have higher satisfaction and higher quality of gender specific care than 
Page 6 of 15 
 
 
those assigned to other providers. Importantly, we also find women assigned to WH-
PCPs are twice as likely to choose to stay in VA health care over time. Designated WH-
PCPs are available across all VA Health Care Systems, and VA is actively recruiting 
additional new providers with even more enhanced proficiency in women’s health care. 
VA provides full services to meet specific needs of women Veterans, such as 
gynecology, maternity care, infertility services, reproductive mental health services and 
military sexual trauma assistance. 
 
Eliminating Veteran Homelessness 
 
VA remains committed to ending Veteran homelessness. The 2022 Budget 
Request includes $2.2 billion for Veteran homelessness programs, an increase of 8.4% 
over the 2021 enacted level (base funding only). In addition, VA will obligate $486 
million in ARP funding in 2022, for a total of $2.6 billion dedicated to reducing Veteran 
homelessness in 2022. The goal is to ensure every Veteran has permanent, sustainable 
housing with access to high-quality health care and other supportive services to prevent 
Veteran homelessness. VA has partnered closely with other Federal agencies and with 
State and local programs across the country to: 
•  Identify all Veterans experiencing homelessness; 
•  Provide shelter immediately to any Veteran experiencing unsheltered 
homelessness; 
•  Provide service-intensive transitional housing to Veterans who prefer and choose 
such a program; 
•  Move Veterans swiftly into permanent housing; and 
•  Have resources, plans, partnerships and system capacity in place should any 
Veteran become homeless or be at risk of homelessness. 
 
VA has made significant progress to prevent and end Veteran homelessness. 
The number of Veterans experiencing homelessness in the United States has declined 
by nearly half since 2010. On any given night in January 2020, an estimated 37,252 
Veterans were experiencing homelessness. Since 2010, over 850,000 Veterans and 
their family members have been permanently housed or prevented from becoming 
homeless. Efforts to end Veteran homelessness have resulted in an expansion of 
services available to permanently house homeless Veterans and the implementation of 
new programs aimed at prevention, including low-threshold care/engagement strategies 
and monitoring homeless outcomes. VA offers a wide array of interventions designed to 
find Veterans experiencing homelessness, engage them in services, find pathways to 
permanent housing and prevent homelessness from reoccurring. 
 
Economic Opportunity 
 
As an overall group, Veterans fare better economically than the average 
American. However, Veterans and their spouses still face economic challenges. Helping 
Veterans build civilian lives of opportunity with the education and jobs worthy of their 
skills and talents is a critical priority. The budget request supports this commitment by 
making key investments in VBA, including an increase of $81.5 million to support the 
Page 7 of 15 
 
 
Digital GI Bill Modernization effort, as well as an increase of $5 million for the Veterans’ 
Clean Energy Job Training program in conjunction with the Department of Labor, and 
$3.6 million for the VA Disability Employment Pilot Project to assist Veterans with 
service-connected disabilities seeking employment opportunities. 
 
VA military-to-civilian transition programs are designed to give transitioning 
Service members the best possible start to their post-military lives. The VA Benefits and 
Services course, as part of the interagency Transition Assistance Program (TAP), helps 
Service members and their spouses understand how to access the VA benefits and 
services they have earned. VA TAP provides resources and tools Service members 
need to achieve emotional and physical health, attain economic stability in civilian life 
and become career ready. Although TAP has evolved significantly over the years, we 
continue to assess its effectiveness and evolve where appropriate to promote 
meaningful and economically enriching lives for Veterans and their families. 
 
Addressing an Aging Infrastructure  
 
The 2022 request includes $2.2 billion, a 26.8% increase over 2021, for Major 
and Minor Construction. The Major Construction request includes funding for 12 medical 
facility and two cemetery expansion projects. Additionally, the President requests $18 
billion in mandatory funding in the American Jobs Plan (AJP) to modernize VA health 
care facilities with $3 billion to address immediate infrastructure needs within VA health 
care facilities and the remaining $15 billion to fully modernize or replace outdated 
medical centers with state-of-the-art facilities. We look forward to working with Congress 
to achieve our shared goal of addressing VA’s aging infrastructure.  
 
VA operates the largest integrated health care, member benefits and cemetery 
system in the Nation, with more than 1,700 hospitals, clinics and other health care 
facilities; a variety of benefits and service locations; and national cemeteries. The VA 
infrastructure portfolio consists of approximately 184 million owned and leased square 
feet—one of the largest in the Federal Government. The median age of U.S. private 
sector hospitals is 11 years; however, the median age of VA’s portfolio is 58 years, with 
69% of VA hospitals over the age of 50. With aging infrastructure comes operational 
disruption, risk and cost. VA estimates that between $49 and $59 billion in short- and 
medium-term investments will be needed to maintain our infrastructure using our annual 
Strategic Capital Investment Planning process. However, any effort to fully address the 
aging infrastructure portfolio needs would likely far exceed those estimates and occur 
over a significant timeline. 
 
VA’s market assessments have been on-going for nearly two years, allowing VA 
to gain significant insights into trends and needs in the VA health care delivery system – 
with enhancing Veteran access and outcomes at the core. The VA MISSION Act 
requires VA to continue construction, leasing, budgeting, and long-range capital 
planning activities while the market assessment and Asset and Infrastructure Review 
(AIR) Commission activities are occurring. The additional AJP investment would enable 
Page 8 of 15 
 
 
planning to start sooner to address facilities we know are not conducive to future health 
care delivery, while still being informed by outcomes of the AIR process. 
 
Health care innovation is occurring at an exponential pace and the comparative 
age between VA facilities and private sector facilities is informed by these trends. The 
architects who designed and constructed many VA facilities in the decades following 
World War II could not have anticipated the requirements of today’s medical technology 
and the key role infrastructure—and technological infrastructure—now plays in 
delivering safe and high-quality health care. As a result, many of VA’s facilities were not 
designed with these technology and infrastructure requirements, which limits our agility 
and ability to meet the evolving health care needs of Veterans. 
 
The experience of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic brought critical 
lessons. Uncertainty regarding the timing and location of the next surge or surges in 
cases across the country underscored the importance of portable capabilities (e.g., 24-
bed Intensive Care Unit that can be transported) for VA health care’s Fourth Mission 
role in future public health emergencies.  
 
Transforming VA health care to achieve a safer, sustainable, greener, person-
centered national health care model requires VA to leverage innovations in medical 
technology and clinical procedures. As technology-enabled trends in U.S. medicine 
bring health care closer to individuals and communities, there is less demand for 
prodigious, sprawling campuses and more demand for emphasis on ambulatory 
facilities and virtual care. Many surgical, medical and diagnostic procedures that once 
required a hospital stay now are performed safely in the outpatient setting, and 
telehealth and tele-service delivery bring expertise to a patient’s own home.  
 
This evolving landscape requires VA to rebalance and recapitalize its 
infrastructure to optimize the mix of traditional inpatient hospitals with outpatient 
hospitals, multi-specialty Community Based Outpatient Clinics, single specialty 
Community Based Outpatient Clinics and virtual care.   
 
Leveraging Technology to Support Service and Medical Care Delivery  
 
VA is undergoing one of the most comprehensive information technology (IT) 
infrastructure modernizations in the Federal government, which will support seamless 
transition of health care information throughout an individual’s journey from military 
service to Veteran status. The 2022 Budget Request includes $4.8 billion in 
appropriations for the Office of Information and Technology to pilot application 
transformation efforts, support cloud modernization, deliver efficient IT services and 
enhance customer service experience. Our three main transformative projects are the 
implementation of the Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM); the 
replacement of VA’s multiple, aging systems to manage its inventory and assets with 
the enterprise-wide inventory management system used by the Department of Defense 
(DoD)—the Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS); and the adoption of 
Page 9 of 15 
 
 
a new financial and acquisition management system—our Financial Management 
Business Transformation (FMBT). 
 
EHRM  
 
In October 2020, VA deployed a new electronic health record (EHR) system at 
the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington. This effort is one of 
the most complex and transformational enterprise-wide endeavors in the Department's 
history. The Budget includes $2.7 billion in FY 2022, which maintains a significant level 
of investment in FY 2022 and in future years and ensures necessary infrastructure 
upgrades are in place. This EHRM appropriation is in addition to the request for the 
central IT appropriation. The vision for the new EHR system is to empower Veterans, 
Service members and care teams with longitudinal health care information to enable the 
achievement of health and life goals from Service in the military to Veteran status. The 
new EHR system also presents the opportunity to achieve unprecedented 
interoperability with the DoD and functions as a catalyst for advancing VA's leadership 
of health care in the United States.  
 
In my first weeks in VA, I directed a 12-week strategic review of the EHRM 
program, which consists of a full assessment of ongoing activities in order to ensure the 
success of future EHR deployments. Based on opportunities identified at the first “go-
live” site in Mann-Grandstaff, the strategic review is focused on ensuring patient safety, 
identifying areas for additional productivity and clinical workflow optimization, change 
management and team-based training; and driving enhanced rigor into VA’s 
management of cost, schedule, and performance.  Additionally, we are conducting a 
human-centered design initiative to optimize the patient portal experience. We intend 
not only to get this right but to drive the industry forward alongside DoD. Furthermore, 
establishing strong, effective management of the EHRM program sets the tone for our 
other key efforts: modernizing supply chain management and enhancing financial and 
business transactions. 
 
VA Logistics Redesign (VALOR) 
 
VA’s response to COVID-19 highlighted the shortcomings of the software and 
business practices supporting VA procurement, logistics and infrastructure operations, 
including a 50-year-old inventory system, separate procurement system and multiple 
stand-alone systems to manage property accountability, distribution and transportation. 
VA also uses multiple, stand-alone systems for health care technology and facility 
management, which limit enterprise visibility of assets and their respective readiness 
conditions. VA is requesting $299 million in FY 2022, an increase of $103 million (53%) 
from FY 2021, to continue its efforts in replacing these systems. 
 
 
VHA is adopting DoD’s proven software platform implementing the Defense 
Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) information technology system to 
modernize and standardize our supply chain, property, health care technology and 
Page 10 of 15 
 
 
facility management business lines. This improvement will allow us to manage the VHA 
supply chain and support functions and operate like other integrated medical systems. 
In doing so, we will ensure clinicians have the supplies and equipment where and when 
needed to provide safe and high-quality care to our Veterans. VA completed the first 
DMLSS deployment at the James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in Chicago, 
Illinois, on September 21, 2020, and is continuing deployment on an accelerated 
schedule. We are grateful for the ARP funds that will help facilitate the continued 
modernization of VA’s badly antiquated supply chain system. 
 
By implementing DMLSS and standardizing our business practices, leaders at 
every level will be able to leverage new capabilities and capitalize on enterprise data to 
drive insights into operations and enable evidence-based decision-making. This 
implementation, too, offers significant opportunity for cost avoidance. 
 
Financial Management Business Transformation 
 
In support of VA fiscal stewardship, the Financial Management Business 
Transformation (FMBT) program is increasing the transparency, accuracy, timeliness 
and reliability of financial and acquisition activities across the Department. The 2022 
Budget includes $357 million for FMBT, a program that is improving fiscal accountability 
to taxpayers and enhancing mission outcomes for those who serve Veterans. Our 
recent roll-out of the new Integrated Financial and Acquisition Management System 
(iFAMS) at NCA and VBA has not been without challenges and has exposed the 
incredible complexities inherent in a financial and acquisition system implementation of 
this magnitude.  We are learning from these early deployments and adjusting our 
strategy accordingly.  Nonetheless, these implementations bring us one step closer to 
providing a modern, standardized and secure integrated solution that enables VA to 
meet its objectives and fully comply with financial management and acquisition 
legislation and directives. The next system rollout is Enterprise Acquisition for NCA, 
which is scheduled for April 2022. System rollouts will then continue across the 
remaining Administrations and Staff Offices until enterprise-wide implementation is 
complete. 
 
An Evolving Landscape Will Influence How VA Cares for Veterans  
 
As VA addresses challenges and longstanding issues, several long-term 
demographic and fiscal trends will shape VA’s ability to serve Veterans in the future. 
Although the U.S. Veteran population is aging and shrinking and simultaneously 
becoming more diverse, demand for VA services continues to increase. As the Veteran 
population continues to evolve, it also continues to use VA more—most likely the result 
of nearly 20 years of sustained conflict, longer average terms of service for military 
personnel and rising health care and educational costs that will incentivize more 
Veterans to use the VA benefits they have earned. U.S. health care is changing, too, 
from a hospital-centric model of care to dispersed (and even virtual) care that can be 
delivered through networks of direct and purchased-care providers.

Congressional Support  
 
Over the past several years, Congress has generously supported VA’s budget 
requests, which have enabled the Department to address new and growing challenges. 
More recently, Congress passed the ARP, which will, among other things:  
 
1.  Help ensure health care access for the 9.2 million enrolled Veterans who 
may have delayed care or have more complex health care needs because 
of the COVID-19 pandemic;  
2.  Forgive Veteran health care copayments and other cost shares and 
reimburse copays and other cost shares for care and prescriptions from 
April 6, 2020 through September 30, 2021; 
3.  Fund construction grants and payments to State Veterans Homes to 
greatly improve the living conditions of our most vulnerable Veterans; 
4.  Provide up to 12 months of training and employment assistance for 
unemployed Veterans to enter high demand occupations; and  
5.  Help reduce the backlog of disability compensation and pension claims, 
which has grown from 73,000 in March 2020 to 188,000 in May 2021. 
 
The Department is grateful for the ARP, which not only will enhance VA’s ability 
to deliver world class services to Veterans and their families, but also will ease 
thousands of Veterans’ worries by forgiving some debt, speed up VA disability 
compensation claims adjudication and provide much needed funding to retrain Veterans 
in high-demand occupations. We will work diligently to ensure these funds are 
effectively and efficiently used.  
 
New Statutory Authorities 
 
Over the past 3 years, Congress has passed into law numerous, far-reaching 
pieces of legislation, including the John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. 
Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside 
Networks Act of 2018 (VA MISSION Act of 2018), the Commander John Scott Hannon 
Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act of 2019, the Veterans Comprehensive 
Prevention, Access to Care, and Treatment Act of 2020 (Veterans COMPACT Act of 
2020), the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits 
Improvement Act of 2020 and the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal 
Year 2021. 
 
The 2022 Budget Request includes over $500 million within VA’s Medical Care 
accounts to begin implementing new and recently expanded health care programs for 
Veterans, including a new grant program for suicide prevention outreach, increased 
eligibility for emergency suicide prevention treatment, new investments in women’s 
health programs, expansion of homeless programs, and military sexual trauma services. 
Page 12 of 15 
 
 
The funding also will further support the Department’s efforts to address substance use 
disorders. 
 
Environmental Exposures 
 
For some medical conditions that develop after military service, the information 
needed to connect these conditions to military service may be incomplete. Information 
may be needed about specific in-service exposures or there may be incomplete 
scientific or medical evidence as to whether an exposure causes a particular condition. 
These issues loom large for all Veterans, represented currently by post-9/11 Veterans, 
whose exposures to airborne and other environmental hazards may result in unknown 
long-term health impacts. I am committed to a full review of how VA provides health 
care and benefits to Veterans exposed to environmental hazards to be responsive to 
the Veterans we serve. I believe it is possible to strike a balance between the needs of 
Veterans and the need for an evidentiary scientific basis for action. 
 
In 2019, Congress passed legislation expanding benefits to tens of thousands of 
Blue Water Navy (BWN) Vietnam Veterans. As of May 1, 2021, VA has completed more 
than 54,000 BWN claims and paid out nearly 900 million in retroactive benefits. More 
recently, VA added three new diseases to the Agent Orange presumptive conditions list 
in the FY 2021 NDAA. VA will begin implementing these provisions so that Vietnam 
Veterans will no longer wait for these earned benefits. As the Department harnesses its 
resources to execute these new requirements and ensure Veterans receive the benefits 
they have earned, I have also recommended initiation of rulemaking to establish a 
presumption of service connection for respiratory conditions related to exposure to 
particulate matter and other airborne hazards, which may conclude such conditions as 
asthma, rhinitis, and sinusitis for Gulf War Veterans. This decision was based on the 
first iteration of a newly formed internal VA process to review scientific evidence relating 
to exposures. VA will conduct broad outreach efforts to reach impacted Veterans and 
encourages them to participate in the rulemaking process. 
 
Research 
 
The Budget includes $882 million, the largest year-over-year increase in recent 
history, for medical and prosthetic research. This historic investment will advance the 
Department’s understanding of the impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and toxic 
exposure on long-term health outcomes while continuing to prioritize research focused 
on the needs of Veterans to include Mental Health and Suicide, Rare Cancers and 
Prosthetics as well as other disease areas. 
 
Increased TBI investment will enhance cutting-edge diagnostics and treatments 
such as investigating the role genomics plays in resilience and recovery from blast 
exposure, validating blast models, and studying the link between TBI and suicide. 
Further investment in environmental exposure includes the VA Military Exposures 
Research Program (MERP), capacity building with Federal partners, and expanding the 
workforce in military exposures research and training. 
Page 13 of 15 
 
 
 
VA will also invest additional resources, including from the American Rescue 
Plan, to advance the Department’s understanding of coronavirus related research and 
impacts. To remain on the cutting edge of technology, VA will focus on software-as-a-
service, cloud computing, and data security, and will continue to partner with the 
Department of Energy (DOE) to capitalize on DOE’s computing power and technical 
expertise to put Veteran data to work. 
 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  
 
Diversity, equity, and inclusiveness are standards fundamental to everything we 
do. We will welcome all Veterans, including women Veterans, Veterans of color, and 
LGBTQ+ Veterans. Every person entering a VA facility must feel safe, free of 
harassment and discrimination, and we will never accept discrimination, harassment or 
assault at any VA facility. We will provide a safe, inclusive environment for Veterans and 
VA employees.  
 
Diversity is a strength, never a weakness, among Veterans, VA employees and 
all of America. Leveraging diversity, equity and inclusiveness will produce the 
excellence in all our interactions with Veterans. I recently instructed my team to 
establish a 120-day task force on diversity, equity and inclusion. The task force’s goal is 
to offer concrete, actionable recommendations while building solidarity across the VA 
system on diversity, equity and inclusion. To support the Department’s commitment to 
strengthening VA’s diversity program and preventing and resolving discrimination at the 
early stages, the Office of Human Resources and Administration created the new Office 
of Resolution Management, Diversity, and Inclusion (ORMDI) by consolidating the 
Office of Diversity and Inclusion and with the Office of Resolution Management.  The 
budget for this combined office will increase by $12.9 million and 74 FTE.  These 
resources will also provide a robust harassment prevention program and counseling 
services while advancing equity for all who have been historically underserved.   
 
The Budget Request also furthers the commitment of the VHA Office of Health 
Equity to help eliminate health disparities based on race, gender, age, religion, socio-
economic status or disability by improving health outcomes for underserved Veteran 
populations. 
 
Empowering Leaders to Implement Positive Change 
 
I am mindful VA’s capabilities have not always risen to the needs of our 
Veterans. Consistent throughout many of these past shortcomings has been a theme of 
leadership inconsistency and cultural challenges. To rebuild trust and restore VA as the 
premier agency for ensuring the well-being of America’s Veterans, I am focusing on 
building a diverse team of professional, experienced leaders who bring a great breadth 
and depth of knowledge in government and Veterans issues. To that end, we recently 
stood up a commission to identify candidates to lead and manage VHA.  
 
Page 14 of 15 
 
 
At the same time, I also am working to retain the talented and hard-working 
leaders we currently have by empowering them to make decisions in a structure that 
allows them to do what’s right for Veterans. As an initial step in support of that effort, I 
recently signed a memo for VA employees emphasizing my intent to lead with VA’s 
ICARE Core Values—Integrity, Commitment, Advocacy, Respect and Excellence – and 
have been seeking opportunities to engage with leaders across the system to drive this 
point home. VA’s success as a team—our ability to deliver world-class care for our 
Veterans—also depends on how employees treat one another and Veterans. Our 
respect for our fellow VA employees and the Veterans we serve is critical to everything 
we do. 
 
Essential to ensuring a healthy and accountable culture at VA is the Office of 
Inspector General’s oversight. The 2022 Budget includes the OIG’s request of $239 
million for 1,100 FTE to support its programs and operations through independent 
audits, inspections, reviews, and investigations. The OIG’s efforts have a significant 
impact on the services and benefits provided to Veterans. This funding level is prudent 
to safeguard the significant investments in VA and to help improve services and benefits 
for Veterans and their families.  
 
I take full responsibility to ensure VA employees have everything they need to 
carry out the important work before us and we operate in a culture that celebrates and 
draws strength from our country’s great diversity. To ensure a welcoming environment 
for Veterans, we must foster fair and inclusive VA workplaces where the experiences 
and perspectives of our diverse employees are valued. The success of our mission 
depends on everyone being able to contribute their expertise, experience, talents, ideas 
and perspectives. I commit to advancing equity in VA and providing all employees with 
opportunities to reach their full potential. I commit to these principles and will make sure 
my senior leadership team reflects and embeds them in everything we do. 
 
At this moment when our country must come together, caring for our country’s 
Veterans and their families is a mission that can unite us all, and I look forward to 
working with this Committee, Congress as a whole and our many other partners to 
embrace our collective responsibility to serve Veterans. 
 
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Boozman, I look forward to working with you 
and this Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to 
discuss my priorities for the Department and how the President’s FY 2022 and FY 2023 
Advance Appropriations Request will serve our Nation’s Veterans.

NOT FOR PUBLICATION 
        UNTIL RELEASED BY THE COMMITTEE
Evolved Priorities 
  America’s Army remains prepared to compete globally and fight and win the 
Nation’s wars as a member of the Joint Force. As demonstrated repeatedly over the 
past year, we also remain the Nation’s principal response force to protect our country 
and communities in the face of unexpected crises. We thank Congress for the 
consistent, predictable, and sustained funding you have provided. This funding enabled 
us to deliver a ready Army that responded promptly and superbly to a dynamic and 
unpredictable security environment, like the COVID-19 pandemic, Middle East tensions, 
civil unrest, cyberattacks, and south-west border mission. Our priorities are well aligned 
with the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance: investing in people, sustaining 
readiness, divesting of legacy systems to reinvest in cutting edge technologies and 
capabilities, mitigating the impact of climate change, and strengthening our alliances 
and partnerships. 
Last October, the Army evolved its priorities to people, readiness, and 
modernization. This evolution reflects the achievements of a multi-year effort to rebuild 
readiness and accelerate modernization. Six years ago, we recognized that readiness 
had declined precipitously after years of reduced funding, uncertain budgets, and 
deferred modernization. We also recognized the need for new concepts, capabilities, 
and posture to compete aggressively in the Indo-Pacific and Europe. With your support, 
we rebuilt tactical readiness in our units and built strategic readiness in our power 
projection infrastructure. We deliberately executed internal reforms over the last four 
years by realigning over $35 billion within the Army budget to self-fund modernization 
priorities in support of joint all-domain operations.  
Thanks to your continued support for Army modernization, we are successfully 
pivoting from the incremental improvements of the past to fulfilling the robust Army 
Modernization Strategy that Congress prescribed in the 2018 National Defense 
Authorization Act. Because of this strategy, and new Congressional authorities to 
streamline the acquisitions process, we are already beginning to field new systems in 
long-range precision fires, air and missile defense, and soldier lethality, with more on 
the way in next generation combat vehicles, future vertical lift, and the Army network. 
With these modernization capabilities, we are able to deliver multi-domain concepts, 
capabilities, and formations that will give the Joint Force asymmetric, all-domain 
advantages against near-peer potential adversaries. Our gains are real, but fragile. With 
Congressional support, we established a deliberate achievable path to deliver a ready 
and modernized Army by 2028 and a transformed multi-domain Army by 2035. 
However, sustaining today’s readiness and modernizing for tomorrow’s readiness is 
only possible through your timely, adequate, predictable, and sustained funding.  
Strategic Environment 
  A dynamic global security landscape continues to challenge our nation. These 
challenges include: (1) borderless threats, like COVID, cyber, violent extremism, and 
climate change; (2) the global siege on democracy to include an increasingly contested 
information environment; and (3) the changing distribution of global power that draws 
new lines and value propositions for many of our allies and partners. These challenges 
require an agile, ready, modern, and multi-domain Army that works alongside strong 
allies and partners. Strategic competitors and regional actors are testing American 
norms, institutions, and alliances. China, our pacing threat, increases its global 
assertiveness, while Russia increases its disruptive behavior. Threats from Iran, North 
Korea, and violent extremism and terrorism remain. While America’s Army maintains a 
tenuous overmatch, it is fleeting. Future conflicts will manifest at longer range, across all 
domains, and at much greater speed, both physically and cognitively.  
  Climate change is altering the Army’s operational environment and adding new 
mission demands; mitigating these effects has been an ongoing priority for the Army for 
several years. Climate change impacts Army installations globally and opens the Arctic 
as a new geographic theater for competition. The Army must consider alternative 
energy sources, improved energy storage, fuel-efficient design, more robust power 
distribution, and new technologies, such as weather pattern and terrain stability 
modeling to better inform operations. 
The Army must also contend with threats from within. The harmful behaviors of 
sexual assault, sexual harassment, racism, and extremism hurt Soldiers and break trust 
with the American people. The Army is working diligently to solidify a culture of cohesion 
and intervention to protect our Soldiers, not only from the deliberate fratricide of these 
behaviors, but from the invisible danger of mental and behavioral health issues, and 
other stressors that can increase the risk of suicide.  
People First  
  Listening to Soldiers led to our very deliberate decision to re-align our priorities. 
The Army’s number one priority is now people. Our people are our Soldiers from the 
Active, Guard, and Reserve components, Army families, Army civilians, and retiree and 
veteran Soldiers for Life. At every echelon, the Army must promote and build cohesive 
teams (1) that are highly trained, disciplined, and fit, (2) that are ready to fight and win, 
and (3) in which each person is treated with dignity and respect. Cohesive teams are 
the foundation of all our people initiatives and how the Army can best sustain readiness 
and transform for the future. Three critical enablers from the 2019 Army People Strategy 
continue to set conditions for putting people first: Army Culture, Quality of Life initiatives, 
and a 21st Century Talent Management System. 
Army Culture 
Last December, the Army stood up the People First Task Force to address and 
implement the 70 Fort Hood Independent Review Committee recommendations, with 
the understanding that the issues identified are not unique to a single installation. Army 
leaders are stewards of a special bond of trust and confidence with the American 
people. We held accountable those leaders deemed to have broken that trust. We have 
fundamentally transformed our command selection process in order to improve the way 
we choose future leaders to assume positions with the most influence over Soldiers. We 
are piloting independent climate assessment teams of subject matter experts to identify 
unit climate trends early and respond before systemic problems emerge. We are 
listening to our people to learn and lead better. We conducted 96 listening sessions 
across 14 locations in addition to a special “Solarium” conference that asked junior- and 
mid-career leaders to develop solutions. The Army is now working to change policies 
and aspects of Army culture that impede prevention and response to harmful behaviors. 
The first policy change introduced “absent – unknown”, an additional duty status code 
which affords missing Soldiers oversight not present in ""Absent Without Leave 
(AWOL).""  
 “This is My Squad” is the foundational principle for Army culture. This initiative, 
led by the Sergeant Major of the Army, promotes cohesion by encouraging Soldiers to 
better know those around them, develop greater compassion, and intervene early to 
protect others. Implementation actions include increased non-commissioned officer 
professional military education, redistribution of experienced leaders, and better 
reception processes for integrating new Soldiers at each installation and unit.  
Project Inclusion is a holistic effort to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion 
across the force. As of March of this year, the Army had conducted 83 Project Inclusion 
listening sessions with over 4,700 attendees. Separately, the Army reviewed its policy 
on official photos and removed official photos from all promotion boards. The Army later 
redacted race, ethnicity, and gender data from Soldier Record Briefs in accordance with 
the Secretary of Defense’s direction. The Army is building relationships with influencers 
in diverse cities and communities to better acquire, develop, employ, and retain the best 
talent across the entire nation. 
Quality of Life (QoL) Initiatives 
  Putting people first also means creating a duty and installation environment that 
allows Soldiers to thrive. The Army continues to prioritize the QoL focus areas identified 
in 2019. The COVID era only reinforced how essential each of those initiatives is to the 
well-being and readiness of our Soldiers and their families. 
Housing and Barracks. We continue executing the Army Housing Campaign 
Plan to shape policies, procedures, and processes at every echelon. The Army 
implemented 14 of the 18 tenets of the Tenant Bill of Rights in its Residential 
Communities Initiatives (RCI) projects. We expect the remaining four (common tenant 
lease, 7-year maintenance history, dispute resolution and rent segregation) to be 
available at the majority of installations with privatized housing by June 1, 2021. We 
implemented mechanisms that hold privatized companies accountable to residents for 
proper maintenance and customer service, hired additional personnel to provide quality 
assurance oversight, and implemented 100 percent change of occupancy inspections 
and quality assurance checks. To address environmental hazards (mold and lead), we 
developed educational materials, a response registry, and policies for habitability and 
displaced residents. Through the RCI, we are committing over $1.8 billion and 
reinvesting another $1 billion to improve residential housing. Additionally, the Army is 
projected to invest over $10 billion in the next 10 years, in both Restoration & 
Modernization and Military Construction funds, which will renovate or replace more than 
1,200 barracks for all components and eliminate sub-standard barracks. 
  Healthcare. Army Medicine is partnering with the Defense Health Agency to 
deliver the best care for our beneficiaries across our installations. We are focusing on 
readiness as the Military Health System reforms. We will emphasize operationally 
oriented training, modernized capabilities, and innovative operational concepts. We are 
grateful to Congress for increases in Health Professional Officer special pay caps. This 
necessary investment ensures Army Medicine can recruit and retain the best quality 
healthcare professionals for the sustainability of the force.  
Childcare. Childcare professionals serve on the front line of the Army’s response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic as they allow mission essential personnel to maintain Army 
readiness. The Army has a multi-pronged strategy to maintain, and in some cases, 
increase access to care. With continued Congressional support, we plan to build 21 
additional Child Development Centers by FY30, adding approximately 4,000 spaces. 
We appreciate Congressional support for the three centers funded in FY21, two in 
Hawaii and one in Alaska. We continue to invest in these professionals, adjusting 
compensation to recruit and retain quality staff. We are incentivizing the family child 
care program, like a $1,000 bonus for new providers and for families that stay in the 
program after a move. We implemented revised DoD priorities for childcare to grant 
more access to military families. Finally, we continue to invest in fee assistance to buy 
down the cost of off-post care when on-post care is unavailable.  
Spouse Employment. With the support of Congress, the Army continues to 
make improvements in spouse employment. The Army reimburses up to $1,000 for 
professional licensing and certification in a new state, with Army Emergency Relief 
offering an additional $2,500. We thank Congress for its efforts to bolster the support of 
individual states in granting reciprocity. We streamlined the Home-Based Business 
application and approval system, improved policies for military spouse hiring 
preference, strengthened the Employment Readiness Program, and made the transfer 
of non-appropriated fund employees between installations easier. We continue to work 
with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to promote workforce development 
scholarships, improve state license reciprocity and professional license compacts, and 
reduce overseas employment barriers. 
Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Moves. Soldiers are now receiving PCS 
orders an average of 120 days before their report date, an improvement of 30 to 90 
days. Families can now claim 100 percent of their costs for reimbursement when 
conducting a personally procured move. Our development and launch of the “Army PCS 
Move” app and automation of several business processes, including the Smart Voucher 
program, are helping families research, book movers, track progress, and file claims, 
expediting reimbursement. Though COVID-19 heavily impacted last summer’s peak 
PCS season, we still executed over 70,000 moves with a 95 percent satisfaction rate. 
21st Century Talent Management System 
The Army continues to refine and implement its 21st Century Talent 
Management System in order to effectively acquire, develop, employ, and retain talent. 
We are maximizing the potential of each Soldier. We are evolving our marketing and 
recruiting with initiatives like Army Hiring Days and the “What’s Your Warrior?” 
campaign to bring in the best talent from across the country, including cities and 
communities with populations who may be unfamiliar with the opportunities military 
service affords. This year the Army launched cutting-edge digital talent initiatives. Our 
Army Artificial Intelligence Center partners with Carnegie Mellon University to grow data 
engineers and data technicians, while our Software Factory leverages the extraordinary 
existing talent in our Army to grow coders to solve Army problems.  
At the heart of the Army’s 21st Century Talent Management System are new 
approaches, systems, and processes that leverage deep data about unit needs and 
Soldier knowledge, skills, behaviors, and preferences. The Integrated Personnel and 
Pay System – Army (IPPS-A) is on track to go live across all three components by the 
end of this calendar year. Release 2 is complete, having brought IPPS-A to the Army 
National Guard across 54 states and territories. Release 3, currently in testing, will 
integrate the active and reserve forces and complete the Army’s transition to a single 
system across all components capable of identifying needed talent and managing 
Soldier careers from accession to transition.  
Talent management starts with having the right Army leaders at the battalion and 
brigade-level. These are the Army’s most consequential leadership positions in terms of 
affecting retention and attrition. In the biggest change to the Army’s command selection 
process in fifty years, the Army now uses a Commander Assessment Program to select 
future battalion and brigade commanders, as well as command sergeants major. This 
intensive five-day program evaluates individuals for their temperament, cognitive 
fitness, physical health, and leadership skills. We are also expanding to build a system 
to assess and select our Army Acquisition Corps civilians at the same echelons. We are 
putting the right people in the right place at the right time to remain ready today.  
Ready Today 
The Army stands ready today to compete globally and fight and win the Nation’s 
wars in support of the Joint Force. This is only because we recognized six years ago 
that readiness had declined precipitously after three years of reduced funding and 
uncertain budgets. Since then, and funding from Congress, we rebuilt tactical readiness 
and built strategic readiness. However, readiness is fragile. We require continued 
support to maintain it, in order to reliably meet the needs of combatant commands 
without overstressing our people.  
People are the Army’s most important weapon system. The Army represents 25 
percent of the Defense budget, 35 percent of the active force, and 45 percent of the 
active and reserve forces, but meets over half of global demands. Today, the Total 
Army supports the Joint Force by supplying Soldiers to combatant commanders in more 
than 140 countries. Over 69,000 Soldiers are in the Indo-Pacific, including over 25,000 
forward deployed on the Korean peninsula. Over 30,000 Soldiers are in Europe 
supporting NATO and the European Deterrence Initiative, including the forward 
command post of our newly reactivated V Corps. We remain dedicated to our 
counterterrorism and train, advise, assist missions, providing over 21,000 Soldiers in 
support of the U.S. Central Command theater. In our Nation’s Capital this year, over 
26,000 National Guard Soldiers mobilized from 28 states to assist with medical 
evacuation, communications, security, logistics and safety support. Last year, we 
executed 64 brigade-equivalent deployments and moved 45 thousand pieces of 
equipment through 55 ports of embarkation/debarkation in support of worldwide 
missions. 
This past year highlighted the need for the Army to defend the Nation at home as 
well as abroad. In response, the Army continually demonstrated its capability and 
capacity to provide timely and effective support in crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic 
expanded the Army’s existing mission set as DoD’s leader in protecting the warfighter 
from biological threats and investigating infectious diseases that threaten public health. 
Since last March, Army scientists, medical professionals, engineers, and logisticians 
from all components have deployed nationwide to aid COVID prevention and response 
efforts. For its vaccine development and distribution initiative, America turned to an 
Army logistician to lead operations. Our National Guard and Reserve units across 
America supported both neighbor and nation in an unprecedented level of mobilization, 
not only for COVID support, but in response to civil unrest, hurricanes, and wildfires, all 
while continuing to train for wartime missions.  
In 2020, the Army demonstrated strategic readiness through its series of 
DEFENDER exercises, despite the constraints of a pandemic environment. Strategic 
readiness involves installation capabilities to mobilize, train, and deploy formations and 
then sustain them from the homeland. DEFENDER-Pacific 2020 witnessed the 
deployment of combat credible forces across the breadth of the Indo-Pacific theater 
from Guam and Palau to the Aleutian Island chain and mainland Alaska. Under the 
command and control of U.S. Army Pacific, combined joint forces executed strategic 
readiness operations that included cargo delivery, forcible entry operations, rapid 
infiltration of High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), operational maneuver of 
Army watercraft, and fighter combat patrols. DEFENDER-Europe 2021 is currently 
underway with over 30,000 multinational forces from 27 nations conducting nearly 
simultaneous operations across 30 training areas. This year’s exercise will incorporate 
Security Force Assistance Brigades, the Army’s new V Corps, and U.S. Air Force and 
Navy assets. DEFENDER-Europe 21 is led by the Army’s newly consolidated U.S. Army 
Europe and Africa Command.  
The foundation of Army readiness is our people. The Army is moving to a 
foundational readiness model that prioritizes the training of individuals and small units at 
the company level and below. The best combat units in the world ensure their 
individuals and small units are masters of their craft. To foster individual readiness, the 
Army is also investing in holistic health and fitness. We continue to study the impact of 
the Army Combat Fitness Test in accordance with Congressional guidance in order to 
better connect individual fitness with combat readiness. A solid foundation of readiness 
enables unit agility and provides the greatest return on an investment of limited time and 
resources. We will continue to use the combat training centers to bring these highly 
trained, disciplined, and fit teams together for large-scale collective training that 
validates the combat effectiveness of our battalions and brigades. 
The Army must balance the continuous demand for current readiness from 
combatant command requirements with the imperative to secure future readiness, all 
without overly stressing our people or our equipment. To this end, the Army developed, 
tested, and rehearsed a new unit lifecycle model that will go into effect October 2021: 
the Regionally Aligned Readiness and Modernization Model (ReARMM). ReARMM will 
harmonize historically conflicting Army priorities. It will take care of people by reducing 
operational tempo and maximizing predictability and stability to commanders, Soldiers, 
and families. ReARMM will sustain readiness by carving out dedicated windows for 
building readiness at echelon while aligning units with primary regions and functions. 
Regional alignment provides units deep wells of knowledge on the terrain, culture, and 
people where their units are most likely to operate. Joint force commanders also gain by 
leveraging habitual, trusted relationships between Army formations and Allies and 
partners. Finally, ReARMM will facilitate modernization by giving units dedicated 
windows to integrate new equipment, reorganize formations, and train on new doctrine. 
Adopting this model transitions the Army from small, incremental, evolutionary 
modernization of platforms to large-step modernization of our formations. 
Army Modernization - Transforming for Tomorrow 
  The Army faces an inflection point that requires innovation, creativity, and 
entrepreneurship in the application of combat power. The battlefield is increasingly 
faster, more lethal, and more distributed. Overmatch will belong to the side that can 
make better decisions faster. To meet emerging challenges, the Army is transforming to 
provide the Joint Force with the speed, range, and convergence of cutting edge 
technologies that will generate the decision dominance and overmatch required to win 
the next fight. We are leading the way in developing and fielding advanced technology 
in support of the Joint Force. 
The Army’s materiel modernization transformation – what we fight with – is based 
on the six modernization priorities announced in 2018: Long Range Precision Fires, 
Next Generation Combat Vehicle, Future Vertical Lift, the Army Network, Air and Missile 
Defense, and Soldier Lethality. The Army’s conceptual transformation—how we fight—
begins with our Multi-Domain Operations concept, which we are currently turning into 
doctrine. The Army is using Project Convergence, our campaign of learning and annual 
capstone event, to shape future concepts and capabilities. By 2035, the Army will 
realize its vision of a multi-domain force. 
The Army is committed to seeing our signature materiel modernization efforts 
through to completion. Many are coming on line according to, or ahead of, our 
accelerated development schedule and being delivered to our Soldiers. Through 
continuous reform efforts, we have been able to redirect scarce resources to these key 
modernization efforts; however, we could not achieve this without Congressional 
support and authorities. Army Futures Command is providing unprecedented unity of 
effort across the modernization enterprise, having changed our business model and 
culture through public-private partnerships and a focus on Soldier-centered design. This 
allows us to gain immediate operator feedback, accelerating the development process 
and ensuring new systems are effective in operational environments. These reforms, 
combined with early experimentation through Project Convergence, are paying 
significant dividends. Judicious use of Middle Tier Acquisition and Other Transaction 
Authorities enable progress from characteristics to fielded capabilities in as short as 
three years, versus the five to seven years it took just to prescribe requirements in the 
past. 
Long Range Precision Fires 
Long range precision fires provide the capability to penetrate Anti-Access/Area 
Denial (A2/AD) environments, suppress air defenses and strike maritime targets at 
range from land, and establish our own A2/AD capability to open windows of opportunity 
for the Joint Force to exploit. In 2019, OSD directed the Army to develop a ground 
based long-range hypersonic weapon. In FY23, the Army will field the first Long Range 
Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) firing battery. The Army is also developing a ground-
launched, Mid-Range Capability that will complement the LRHW and the Precision 
Strike Missile (PrSM) capabilities. The PrSM is on schedule to conduct its maximum 
range test in 3QFY21 and deliver 30 missiles in FY23. It will provide greater range, 
lethality, and survivability at a lower cost per shot than ATACMS. The Extended Range 
Cannon Artillery remains on schedule for delivery in FY23. It will establish overmatch 
against peer adversaries in the close and deep operational maneuver areas with an 
extended range out to 70km. 
Next Generation Combat Vehicle 
Next generation combat vehicles will increase the firepower, speed, and 
survivability of land forces, allowing them to maneuver into positions of advantage in the 
future operational environment. After rebaselining the Optionally Manned Fighting 
Vehicle (OMFV) program last year, the Army issued the final request for proposal for the 
concept design phase on December 18, 2020. OMFV is an example of how our new 
acquisitions process enabled the Army to learn early and recover before programs 
become too big to fail. The Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) effort envisions an 
unmanned platform that provides decisive mobility, lethality, survivability, and increased 
situational awareness to formations. RCV will undergo increasingly rigorous 
experiments and capability demonstrations with a decision to procure by FY24. The 
Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is an adaptable and more survivable multi-
variant vehicle that replaces the 1960s era M113 Family of Vehicles. Mobile Protected 
Firepower (MPF) is an armored combat vehicle that will provide, large caliber, long-
range direct fires in support of Infantry Brigade Combat Teams. The first unit equipped 
with MPF will be in FY25. 
Future Vertical Lift 
Future Vertical Lift platforms and technologies increase the maneuverability, 
range, endurance, lethality, and survivability of Army aircraft, providing joint 
commanders with increased operational reach and effectiveness against near-peer 
competitors. Our new acquisitions process has put the onus on industry to innovate and 
invest early, allowing the Army to “fly before we buy.” The Future Armed 
Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) closes the gap left by retirement of the Vietnam-era 
Kiowa. Two prototypes will fly in FY23 followed by a year-long flight demonstration. The 
Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) will replace the UH60 Blackhawk with 
increased speed, range, payload, and endurance. We expect initial FLRAA prototypes 
in FY25. Future vertical lift will leverage advances in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) 
technology to develop Air Launched Effects (ALE) with a wide array of payloads and 
extended communication mesh networks with a fielding plan in FY24.  
Army Network 
The Army network modernization underpins Project Convergence as the Army’s 
contribution to Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control. It provides 
necessary information technology (IT) infrastructure to link the right sensors to the right 
shooters through the appropriate command and control node. In FY21, we will field 
more than 150 units with new technologies while simultaneously developing the next 
capability set of equipment. The Army is also modernizing current Global Position 
System (GPS) receivers to meet current and emerging threats by providing the Joint 
Force with advanced assured precision, navigation and timing (APNT) systems. 
Included are modernized receivers that meet congressional mandates to transition to M-
code GPS and integrate alternative APNT technologies for our ground combat 
platforms, dismounted Soldiers, precision weapons and munitions, and aviation 
systems. We are fielding the first generation mounted APNT systems to our forward 
deployed formations with a second generation ready not later than FY23. Additionally, 
the Army continues to invest in space-based technologies that close operational gaps in 
deep sensing and targeting activities. We are coordinating with partners in the 
Intelligence Community and private industry to enhance Army access to Low Earth Orbit 
(LEO) space-based sensing and link with national-level capabilities to provide tactical-
level sensor to shooter capability to combat formations. 
Air and Missile Defense 
Air and missile defense capabilities defend the Joint Force, allies, and partners 
against manned and unmanned air and missile threats. The Army’s integrated air and 
missile defense capabilities will protect joint forces from adversary aircraft, missiles, and 
drones to protect the force and enable operations. This includes both theater systems 
and tactical / short-range air defense like the Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (M-
SHORAD) which defeats aerial threats to the maneuver force with a mix of kinetic 
capabilities. The Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) is 
developing a Directed Energy (DE) M-SHORAD variant that utilizes a 50kW class laser. 
We will field four DE prototypes for experimentation and further development. Indirect 
Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) will defend fixed and semi-fixed assets primarily 
against cruise missiles and Unmanned Aircraft Systems as well as fixed and rotary wing 
aircraft. Based on the authorization in the 2021 NDAA, the Army is currently preparing 
two Iron Dome batteries for operational deployment at the end of FY22. This spring the 
Army will conduct a shoot-off to inform our decision on the enduring IFPC solution. 
RCCTO is also working on two IFPC variants, a High Energy Laser (HEL) and a High-
Powered Microwave (HPM). The IFPC-HEL uses a 300kW-class HEL to defeat Rocket, 
Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats and is on track for demonstration. The IFPC-High-
Powered Microwave is being developed with the Air Force to produce the Tactical High 
Power Microwave Operational Responder (THOR) in FY21 with a prototype expected in 
FY24. The Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) initial 
operational capability is 3QFY22 with fielding. IBCS is a revolutionary command-and-
control system that streamlines sensor to shooter linkages for air and missile defense 
engagements—and once fielded with enable optimized employment of the Patriot force. 
This enhanced tracking system delivers an unambiguous view of the operating 
environment, allowing commanders and air defenders to make critical decisions within 
seconds. The Lower-Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) will deliver the 
next generation sensor that leverages the capabilities of the Patriot Missile Segment 
Enhanced (MSE) interceptor and is fully integrated into IBCS.  
Soldier Lethality 
Soldier Lethality improvements to weapons, sensors, body armor, and training 
will deliver decision dominance and overmatch at the level where it matters most-, 
allowing individual Soldiers to quickly understand and react to emerging situations. With 
ReARMM, we are incorporating Guard and Reserve units into the fielding schedule 
much earlier and more broadly than in past modernization efforts. The Army seeks 
continued Congressional support for the rapid prototyping, development, and 
procurement of the Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) Rifle and Automatic Rifle, 
Enhanced Night Vision Goggles (ENVG), Integrated Visual Augmentation System 
(IVAS) - Heads-Up Display (HUD) 3.0, and the Synthetic Training Environment (STE). 
By 1QFY22, we’ll equip the first unit with IVAS. In 4QFY22, we will equip the first unit 
with the Next Gen Squad Weapon Rifle and Automatic Rifle, as well as General 
Purpose Ammo. STE efforts that complement IVAS include the Squad Immersive Virtual 
Trainer (as part of IVAS) and the STE Information System that includes: One World 
Terrain, Training Simulation Software, and Training Management Tools. 
In addition to our six priorities, the Army understands the need for considerable 
investment in long-term research to deliver science and technology solutions. The Army 
is aligning its laboratories towards modernization and partnering with over 250 research 
institutions. The Army’s priority research areas are: disruptive energetics, Radio 
Frequency (RF) electronic materials, quantum research, hypersonic flight, artificial 
intelligence, autonomy, synthetic biology, material by design, and advanced 
manufacturing. 
The Army is also investing in deep sensing and analysis to provide intelligence 
support to long range precision fires and commanders’ situational awareness during 
Joint All-Domain Operations. We will continue to drive intelligence modernization by 
acquiring capabilities and capacities across the Space, Aerial, Terrestrial, and 
Foundation Layers nested with and in support of the Army’s six modernization priorities. 
We will continue to leverage the Intelligence Community (IC), other Services’, and 
commercial partner enterprise-level Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance 
collection programs to provide timely, accurate, and relevant intelligence to support 
Army targeting efforts and enhance commanders’ decision making. 
The Army is not just modernizing concepts and materiel. We require continued 
budget support to modernize infrastructure and execute workload in our Organic 
Industrial Base (OIB) of depots, arsenals, and ammunition plants, along with our power 
projection and Mobilization Force Generation Installations to better project power from 
and into contested environments. We must be able to address the risk of new and 
emerging cyber, information, and physical threats that can thwart our ability to project 
power by disrupting installation operational capabilities and the supply chains 
supporting our forces, whether from malign actors or nature. Our installations must be 
resilient to disruption and modernized in support of the modernized Army force. The 
Army is investing significant time and resources to mitigate the effects of climate change 
on our installations. We are establishing energy and water resilience, efficiency, and 
affordability across our installation enterprise. In the past five years, energy programs, 
partnerships and initiatives recognized a cost avoidance or savings of more than 14 
percent, every installation has added a full-time energy manager position, and 16 of 26 
Army OIB depots, arsenals and ammunition plants have transitioned from fossil fuels to 
clean energy alternatives. We are also partnering with private industry to implement 
energy and utility savings contracts that maximize the latest technology to drive 
efficiency and reduced costs, with 99 agreements currently in execution. 
The Army is also not modernizing in a vacuum, but in partnership with our sister 
Services. We have completed two Army-Air Force Warfighter Talks and one Army-Air 
Force-Navy joint session to ensure the Army’s Project Convergence initiatives remains 
synchronized with the Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System and the Navy’s 
Project Overmatch to meet the unique needs of each Service. As we work to stand-up a 
Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) in Europe later this year, our Indo-Pacific aligned 
MDTF continues to synchronize effects with the Joint Force during multiple exercises. 
The MDTF’s All-Domain Operations Center enables Joint training, to include hosting 
Carrier Strike Group-3 for the Navy’s Fleet Synthetic Training – Joint exercise and 
connecting to the Navy’s Continuous Training Environment network. During 
INDOPACOM’s Pacific Fury 21, the MDTF validated its ability to virtually synchronize 
long range fires and effects with the Joint Force. The MDTF will participate in 
USINDOPACOM’s upcoming Northern Edge and Joint All Domain Command and 
Control (JADC2) Simulation Experiment (SIMEX) in May before rotating into the Indo-
Pacific later this summer to participate in joint exercises with PACAF, PACFLT, and 
MARFORPAC. 
Strengthening Alliances and Partnerships 
  America does not fight alone. Alliances and partnerships are among the greatest 
sources of our military strength. This global landpower network is DoD’s foundation for 
competition, creating inroads and maneuver space for Joint and whole-of-government 
strategic engagement. As a people organization, the Army is uniquely qualified to 
maintain and expand this vital network, especially given that partner militaries and their 
senior leaders are predominately land force-centric. Our roadmap for building and 
strengthening relationships spans a range of activities that include military and key 
leader engagements, education and training programs such as the Department of 
State’s International Military Education and Training (IMET) and International 
Professional Military Education (IPME), security assistance through Title 22 Foreign 
Military Sales, and advise and assist capabilities. Boots on the ground deter would-be 
adversaries, and small, scalable engagements with our Allies and partners open doors 
to the access and presence we need to compete effectively. The Army’s new Security 
Force Assistance Brigades (SFAB) demonstrate our commitment to alliances and 
partnerships and our capability to compete. 
Last year we completed the activation of all six SFABs, five in the Regular Army 
and one in the Army National Guard. Since then, 5th SFAB has already completed 
missions with multiple partners across the Indo-Pacific theater, including elements of 
the Thai, Indonesian, and Indian armies. Later this year, many of those partners will join 
their American counterparts in combined exercises at the National Training Center. 
Engagements such as these are vital, not only for interoperability, but in recognition that 
Cold War-era exclusive allegiance to a single great power no longer exists. Many if not 
all of our allies and partners maintain concurrent relationships with both the United 
States and our competitors and potential adversaries. We cannot take for granted these 
relationships and the vital access and presence they provide us. 
Closing 
The men and women of the United States Army are the greatest Soldiers in the 
world. The Army is cultivating cohesive teams, maximizing talent, sustaining tactical and 
strategic readiness, progressing through our greatest transformation in over 40 years, 
and strengthening our alliances and partnerships. We are leading the way in developing 
and fielding high technology for the Joint Force. We are opening operational and 
strategic doors in the Indo-Pacific and Europe. We are succeeding through calibrating 
our force posture around the globe to assure our partners and deter would-be 
adversaries. And we need your continued support. With timely, adequate, predictable, 
and sustained funding, we will remain ready to fight and win our Nation’s wars—now 
and into the future.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE LLOYD J. AUSTIN III 
PREPARED REMARKS BEFORE THE  
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE 
JUNE 17, 2021 
Introduction 
 
Chairman Leahy, Vice Chairman Shelby, Chairman Tester, distinguished members of the committee: 
thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of the President’s budget request for Fiscal Year (FY) 
2022. 
On behalf of myself, Deputy Secretary Hicks, the leadership of the Department of Defense, and the men 
and women of our Department and their families, let me also thank you for your continued support and 
partnership as we work to address the threats facing the United States of America today, and build the 
force that can address the challenges of tomorrow. I also want to thank the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, General Mark Milley, who is testifying alongside me and is a critical partner in realizing the 
Department’s priorities.  
The President’s $715 billion defense budget request for FY 2022 provides us with the capabilities we 
need most and drives investment in efforts that will help us advance our three key priorities: defending 
the nation, taking care of our people, and succeeding through teamwork. 
Today, the Department of Defense stands ready to deter conflict in any domain and, if necessary, to fight 
and win against any challenger. Since becoming Secretary of Defense, I have met with many of our 
service members and commanders in the field and have seen first-hand the dedication of the men and 
women of our Department. I can assure you that we continue to have the best joint fighting force on 
Earth and a civilian workforce fully dedicated to the many critical missions we face.  
We must maintain and improve this advantage on land, at sea, in the air, and in emerging domains, 
including space and cyberspace. I am confident that the President’s budget request helps us do that. The 
request is driven by our recognition that our competitors—especially China—continue to advance their 
capabilities. We must outpace those advances to remain a credible deterrent to conflict around the world.  
The President’s budget request represents my commitment to matching resources to strategy, strategy to 
policies, and policies to the will of the American people. This budget also reflects difficult funding 
decisions necessary to ensure that we have the right mix of capabilities that we need most. We have 
proposed cuts to systems and capabilities that no longer meet the challenges and requirements of the 
Department, making room for more advanced programs that do. In making these decisions, we were 
guided by the President’s Interim National Security Strategic Guidance and informed by a set of 
program reviews conducted by the Department early in this Administration.  
We are also undertaking a series of strategic reviews in the Department to ensure that our global force 
posture, and our nuclear and missile defense capabilities, are matched with the challenges that we face 
and aligned with the priorities of the President. The Global Posture Review will help inform my advice 
to the Commander-in-Chief about how best to allocate our forces around the world to advance our 
1 
 
national interests, and our nuclear and missile defense reviews will consider how we maintain our 
deterrent and defensive capabilities, within and across domains.  
I take very seriously the importance of being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and ensuring that we are 
transparent and honest with the American people about how their money is spent. This year, the 
President’s budget consolidates the Overseas Contingency Operations funding and the base budget, 
raising transparency of direct war costs to a level not seen in several years.  
We are also working to address our audit responsibilities as quickly and effectively as possible and 
move forward on reform to our business operations. This is not just about finding and reapplying 
savings to higher priorities, it is about improving organizational performance and efficiency. The best 
advocates for reform are those closest to the issues, so we will hold leaders appropriately accountable 
for a management improvement agenda within their respective components. Reform also requires a 
holistic approach—including concepts of operation, organizations, personnel, training, and modern 
systems—and must have a seat at the table in our deliberations over Department programs and priorities. 
The FY 2022 budget also reflects the President’s decision to retrograde in Afghanistan, following 20 
years of war in that theater. We are profoundly grateful to our uniformed service members and their 
families, and to our civilian workforce, who have served and sacrificed so much through combat 
deployments in the defense of our nation since the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001. 
We are now engaged in a deliberate, safe, and orderly withdrawal from Afghanistan following the 
President’s decision. 
Moving forward, we must continue to engage in a concerted effort to recruit, retain, and develop the 
finest talent available for the uniformed and civilian workforce, providing quality opportunities for 
personal and professional growth, advancement, and leadership to those in our charge.  
We owe it to them to build an environment that is safe, welcoming, and free of fear, harassment, or 
violence. That is why I have focused some of my earliest efforts on addressing sexual assault and 
harassment in the Department, identifying and addressing extremist behavior in the ranks, and ensuring 
that everyone is given a fair and equitable opportunity to serve this country. 
But we cannot do this work alone. Whether it is defending the nation, building a force of the future, 
growing our talent, or building an environment welcoming to all, we rely on teamwork that starts at the 
senior-most levels of the Department, filters down into our workforce, and extends across departments 
to our relationships with interagency colleagues, Congress, and our allies and partners.  
When called upon to protect and defend our nation, the Department of Defense will always answer, but 
diplomacy must be our first national security tool of choice. That is why the President’s FY 2022 budget 
helps fund a Department of Defense able to credibly back up the hard work of our diplomats through our 
deterrent capabilities and our force posture.  
As we look outward to our global security interests, we are focused on strengthening our relationships 
with our allies and partners. The investments in this budget demonstrate that the United States will 
continue to be a key guarantor of the peace, security, and the rules-based world order that we have 
helped foster for the past seven decades.  
2 
 
The FY 2022 budget request ensures that we will remain the best-trained and best-equipped military in 
the world and will have the resources to defend the nation, with the confidence to advance our priorities 
and build and sustain the force we need now and in the years ahead. 
Defending the Nation 
 
As the President has noted, the country finds itself at an inflection point. The rapid pace of development 
of capabilities by our competitors, and the changing character of conflict that comes with it, mean that 
we can no longer do things the way we always have and sustain our military edge.   
China has invested heavily in new technologies, with a stated intent to complete the modernization of its 
forces by 2035 and to field a “world-class military” by 2049.  Russia has shown that it is not afraid to 
target the United States in contested domains like cyberspace and still shows a continued interest in 
regional hegemony. Iran continues to advance its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and to support 
destabilizing proxy groups in the Middle East in an effort to threaten its regional neighbors. We also 
face challenges from North Korea, a country with the ambition to be capable of striking the U.S. 
homeland. 
We will continue to address violent extremist and transnational criminal organizations active in several 
theaters and to face unexpected but challenging tests of our resolve like the deadly spread of COVID-19. 
Climate change is a growing challenge, the effects of which are driving regional conflicts and instability, 
even as extreme weather caused by a changing planet threatens installations and readiness.    
As the character of conflict and competition changes and accelerates, our strategic competitors have 
watched our efforts in warzones over the last two decades, seeking to understand not only our 
capabilities but also our will to defend our interests abroad. They are watching us and learning from us. 
I have asked the Department to think through our capabilities and operational concepts and how we use 
cyber, space, and nuclear capabilities to create a more credible and resilient deterrent against our 
competitors, including China. What I have in mind are ways we can better use the capabilities we 
already have, including by integrating across domains, and determining the capabilities we need to 
address potential future conflict.  
This means investing in cutting edge technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. It 
also means ensuring that if an adversary attacks one system or domain—in cyberspace or Global 
Positioning System (GPS) satellites, for example—we are able and ready to respond through appropriate 
and separate means in other domains, as necessary.  
This is going to take a culture shift in the Department because it requires working across Military 
Services, domains, and regions in a way that we have not done before. It also requires deeper integration 
with our allies and partners, ensuring that their capabilities add value in deterrence and in conflict. 
The FY 2022 budget request will help us achieve this new vision of 21st-century deterrence, and we 
look forward to your support and partnership to help get it right.

Regional Challenges 
 
In the Indo-Pacific region, we are facing an increasingly assertive People’s Republic of China (PRC). 
Beijing’s regional ambitions have grown, as has its footprint around the world, drawing on significant 
economic influence to encourage and, in some cases, coerce countries into a deepening relationship with 
the PRC.  
But China’s ambitions are not only economic. It seeks to use its influence to shift rules and norms in the 
region, erode democratic values and human rights, and challenge a free and open Indo-Pacific region. 
The President’s Interim National Security Strategic Guidance identifies China as the only global 
competitor capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a 
sustained challenge to the international order.  
As the Department of Defense, our responsibility is to protect and defend our interests in the Indo-
Pacific region and to assure our allies and partners of our commitment to our shared goals. That requires 
keeping pace with the rapid military modernization of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and 
remaining sighted on the PLA’s advancements in the South and East China Seas, the Second Island 
Chain, and beyond.  
That is why I established the China Task Force early in my tenure. The Task Force’s mandate was to 
conduct a baseline assessment of Department policies, programs, and processes on China-related matters 
so that we might better meet the challenge posed by the PRC. The Task Force has now completed its 
work. Based on its recommendations, yesterday I issued internal guidance initiating major Department-
wide efforts to address China as the United States’ number one pacing challenge. 
Even as we address China’s growing military capability, we will remain focused on North Korea. 
Pyongyang continues to develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, posing an increasing threat to 
regional allies and partners and with ambitions to be able to strike the U.S. homeland. Leading with 
diplomacy, the United States will continue to work to mitigate North Korea’s destabilizing and 
provocative behavior and maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.  
In Europe, I am focused on strengthening our relationships with our allies and partners, bilaterally and in 
NATO. The Department will ensure that we are postured to deter aggression from Russia or any other 
power that seeks to challenge us in the region. Our alliance with NATO remains ironclad, and our allies 
remain a force multiplier for U.S. security around the world. We are encouraged that NATO defense 
spending has increased for the seventh straight year, demonstrating their commitment to the strength of 
the alliance. The FY 2022 budget supports efforts to grow the capability and capacity of our allies.  
Over the past 20 years, much of our effort as a Department has been focused on the threat posed by 
violent extremist organizations operating out of parts of the Middle East and South Asia. We remain 
committed to ensuring that no one launches an attack on the U.S. homeland, and we will maintain the 
capability to protect the United States and our interests in the region. That includes countering the 
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, al-Qa’ida, and associated terrorist networks that pose ongoing threats to 
the United States.  
4 
 
Meanwhile, Iran remains a destabilizing force as it seeks to advance its nuclear and ballistic missile 
programs, threaten freedom of navigation, and support proxy terrorist and militia groups. We will 
continue to maintain the capability to deter Iran in the Middle East. We will also continue to support our 
partners in the region, including by helping to ensure that Israel has the capability to defend itself 
effectively and maintain its qualitative military edge.  
In Afghanistan, the Department is working to conduct a deliberate, orderly, and safe withdrawal, as 
directed by the President. This is an important step in responsibly ending this two-decade-long conflict, 
and it offers us an opportunity to redirect our resources toward strategic competition.  
In Africa, the Department is focused on sustaining and improving the capabilities of our partners, 
particularly as we deter and disrupt terrorist attacks by al-Shabaab. The group remains an active threat to 
Somalis, their neighbors, our interests in Africa, and those of our allies and partners. Our partner-centric 
strategy has always been at the core of our counterterrorism mission, and we will continue to help 
regional partners strengthen their capabilities to counter shared threats. This is critical to stability and the 
opportunity for political and economic development in East Africa.  
To the north, the Department remains committed to preserving a free and open Arctic region, which is 
why we undertake annual Arctic exercises and operations, including with allies and partners, such as 
ARCTIC EDGE, ICEX, and NORTHERN EDGE. These exercises provide valuable experience and 
offer important lessons learned for conducting multi-domain operations in the High North.  
In the western hemisphere, our competitors seek to gain a foothold through economic and security 
investment and cooperation. We remain focused on building partner capacity and capability to ensure 
that the United States remains the partner of choice and to address transnational criminal and terrorist 
networks active in the region.  
Additionally, the Department supports interagency efforts to address the migration crisis. Although other 
departments and agencies appropriately lead efforts to respond to this challenge, DoD supports partner 
nations in addressing the security-related aspects of the root causes of migration. This includes 
providing limited humanitarian and medical assistance and participating in engagements to strengthen 
the professionalism of Central American militaries and defense institutions. 
Here in the United States, our men and women in uniform have supported our critical domestic 
missions. National Guard personnel provide support to our fellow Americans, including at Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) mass vaccination sites. National Guard personnel have also 
helped secure our national Capitol at various times over the past year, and thousands more have helped 
secure State capitals across the United States at the direction of State officials. We also continue to 
support law enforcement operations on our southern border by providing limited enabling capabilities. 
At the request of the Department of Health and Human Services, we are supporting its mission to shelter 
unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the border.  
COVID-19 
 
Tackling COVID-19 has been one of my highest and most urgent priorities. Since I became Secretary of 
Defense, the Department has received almost 500 FEMA mission assignments and 67 requests for 
5 
 
assistance from other Federal departments and agencies. As of June 15, more than 4,700 active-duty 
service members have deployed to 34 community vaccination centers in 28 States and territories. 
Additionally, more than 32,000 National Guard personnel have deployed, carrying out FEMA mission 
assignments issued to DoD to assist their local communities.  
In total, the Department has administered nearly 17 million vaccine doses to the American people, with 
more than 4.9 million delivered by active-duty personnel and more than 11.9 million supported by the 
National Guard. Within the Department, we have executed one of the most complex vaccination 
programs in the world, vaccinating millions of service members, beneficiaries, and Department 
personnel in 42 countries, including multiple combat zones. Internally, the Department has protected its 
force and families by administering more than 3.8 million vaccinations. 
We are also making investments in the Defense Health Agency to ensure that we have the resources 
needed for public-health surveillance and force protection. We continue to review and update our force 
health protection policies, and even as vaccinations increase, we remain committed to testing, which will 
expand our genomic sequencing efforts so that we can track variants and declining immunity. 
I am tremendously proud of our men and women in uniform who stepped up to join our whole-of-nation 
response. But this will not be the last time our nation and our world will face such a challenge. That is 
why our budget request also funds programs that support biological threat reduction, in cooperation with 
our global partners, emerging infectious-disease surveillance, biosafety and biosecurity, and medical 
countermeasure research and development. 
Climate Change 
 
We face a grave and growing climate crisis that is threatening our missions, plans, and capabilities. 
From increasing competition in the Arctic to mass migration in Africa and Central America, climate 
change is contributing to instability and driving us to new missions.  
At the same time, increasingly frequent extreme weather events degrade force readiness and drain 
resources. Recent DoD budgets have been forced to absorb recovery costs at battered bases such as 
Naval Air Station Pensacola, among others. Our military installations, and the mission-critical 
capabilities they support, must be made resilient to climate-induced extreme weather.   
Our mission objectives are aligned with our climate goals. The Department is investing in projects and 
capabilities that mitigate the impacts of climate change while improving the resilience of our facilities 
and operations to a range of threats. Our budget request also invests in initiatives to reduce operational 
energy demand to enhance capability, improve freedom of action in contested logistical environments, 
and reduce costs. Those investments are good for the climate, and they are critical for the mission.  
Additionally, this budget invests in power and energy research and development to improve installation 
and platform energy performance and optimize military capability. The Department can help lead by 
leveraging its buying power to deploy technologies such as energy storage and microgrids that support 
the mission while protecting the climate. 
6 
 
The Climate Working Group is coordinating the Department’s work implementing the President’s 
Executive Order on this crisis and building up climate expertise within DoD. It will also track the 
implementation of climate- and energy-related actions and progress toward future goals.  
Modernization and Innovation 
 
One of our chief priorities is to drive innovation across the Department and modernize our culture, 
people, systems, and processes to meet our future needs. It is critical to nearly everything we do. Even as 
we develop new capabilities, we will always adhere to our international humanitarian law obligations in 
the use of new weapons of war, as well as ensure the protection of civilians in all missions.  
This budget supports our efforts to: 
  Modernize the nuclear Triad to maintain a strong and effective strategic deterrent;  
  Make critical investments in advanced technologies such as microelectronics, fifth-generation 
network (5G), and artificial intelligence (AI);   
  Ensure access to precursors and key inputs by shoring up our critical supply chains; 
  Accelerate investments in cutting-edge capabilities that will define the future fight, such as 
hypersonics and long-range fires; and 
  Advance our joint warfighting concepts and commit to rapid experimentation and the fielding of 
emergent capabilities across warfighting domains. 
 
The nuclear Triad remains the bedrock of our national defense and strategic deterrence, ensuring that no 
adversary believes it can employ nuclear weapons against the United States or our allies without risking 
devastating consequences.  
But we must modernize our aging capabilities to ensure a credible deterrent for the future. As we do, we 
will review ongoing programs to assess their performance, schedule, risks, and projected costs. The FY 
2022 budget invests in nuclear modernization efforts, and the Department will always seek to balance 
the best capability with the most cost-effective solution. We are also launching a nuclear posture review 
to ensure that we have the right capabilities matched with the national nuclear strategy.  
Microelectronics enable many of today’s capabilities, such as GPS, radar, command and control, and 
communications. Advanced microelectronics are key to nearly all of the Department’s modernization 
efforts, from AI and hypersonic weapons systems to 5G wireless networks. The Department will 
continue to invest in programs to secure U.S. microelectronics interests; reverse the erosion of domestic 
innovation and supply; and establish a strong foundation for the next generation of microelectronics 
technology for DoD applications, while also sustaining current systems. 
The U.S. military must also utilize the connectivity provided by 5G to operate with the speed, precision, 
and efficiency required in the future. Countries that master advanced communications technologies and 
connectivity will have long-term military advantages; for example, tomorrow’s warfighters will be able 
to use local and expeditionary 5G networks to move considerable amounts of data to connect distant 
sensors and weapons into a dense, resilient battlefield network.  
7 
 
Similarly, the power of AI will help us modernize not only our warfighting decisions but also our 
business processes. We must be able to ingest, make sense of, and act on the vast amounts of 
information available to our warfighters on the battlefield and our decision-makers leading our 
Department. As I have said, we must understand faster, decide faster, and act faster. And we must do it 
all responsibly and at scale.  
To support many of these efforts, we recently launched the Innovation Steering Group. This entity, 
chaired by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, will advise me on science, 
technology, and technological transition. It will also empower efforts to make the changes to incentives, 
processes, and structures needed to truly innovate.  
However, our efforts are not just focused on buying the capabilities of the future. We must 
fundamentally shift the way we think and the way we do business. We have not yet made full use of our 
most agile acquisition authorities, and we remain too risk-averse as a Department to move decisively 
beyond the capabilities of today and prepare for the future.  
We also remain too reliant on critical minerals produced in or by China. To shore up our critical supply 
chains, we must focus on building our domestic production capabilities and growing our defense 
industrial base. That is why I am establishing the Supply Chain Risk Management Group, which will 
complement the work of the Industrial Base Council, both of which are chaired by the Under Secretary 
of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment. 
Tomorrow’s conflicts will be contests of speed within and across domains of conflict. The President’s 
budget request invests in the development and testing of hypersonic strike capabilities, while enhancing 
existing long-range strike weapons to bolster deterrence and improve survivability and response 
timelines. Long-range fires provide key offensive capabilities that are cost-effective and improve 
deterrence. By enabling power projection from standoff ranges, the risk to critical U.S. assets decreases 
while the defensive burden imposed on the enemy increases.  
The Department is also focused on developing enhanced joint warfighting concepts; expanding 
experimentation and fielding; shifting our budget and investment priorities to incentivize innovation; 
and improving acquisition systems while making use of more flexible ones to identify and deliver new 
capabilities at scale. These efforts will help build a force that is more resilient and integrated and that 
ensures decision advantage across all domains.  
Domain Challenges 
 
On land, the Army continues to invest in its six modernization priorities: long-range precision fires, 
future vertical lift, next-generation combat vehicle, air and missile defense, the network, and soldier 
lethality. To sustain the required funding levels for the development and procurement of next-generation 
capabilities, the Army reduced resources for several platforms as well as missiles, munitions, and 
conventional ammunition.  
At sea, delivering all-domain naval power that can defend the homeland, deter adversaries, control the 
seas, and project power ashore in a conflict requires the Navy to balance current operational demands 
with the need for modernization. Maintaining naval power is critical to reassuring allies and signaling 
8 
 
U.S. resolve to potential adversaries. The budget request proposes responsible investments in the Navy 
fleet. It also continues the recapitalization of our strategic ballistic-missile submarine fleet and invests in 
remotely-operated and autonomous systems and the next-generation attack submarine program.  
We also seek to divest of some platforms that do not contribute effectively to power-projection needs. 
The FY 2022 request reflects a strong commitment to continued U.S. naval dominance, including a 
properly sized and well-positioned defense industrial base. The health of the defense industrial base 
continues to be fundamental to achieving and sustaining our future fleet. Our shipbuilding and 
supporting vendor base constitute a national security imperative that must be steadily supported and 
grown to maintain a skilled workforce.  
In the air domain, the Air Force will shift away from certain platforms in favor of key weapons systems 
such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the F-15EX Eagle II, and the Next Generation Air Dominance 
aircraft to bolster the Air Force’s ability to provide air superiority. Meanwhile, we will drive down 
sustainment costs, the fleet’s average age, and inherent risk. At all times, we will work to ensure 
rigorous oversight of maintenance costs of the F-35. 
Additionally, Air Force investments in hypersonics, the Long-Range Standoff Weapon, the B-21 Raider, 
and the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent will allow the Department to conduct global strike operations 
with precise conventional and unconventional capabilities, delivered from both standoff capabilities and 
penetrating platforms. Meanwhile, the Navy is developing the “Air Wing of the Future” to deliver game-
changing lethality and survivability. These efforts include transforming Carrier Air Wings with the 
addition of the F-35C, E-2D, and CMV-22B aircraft and rapidly developing the MQ-25 Stingray.   
Unfettered access to space and the freedom to maneuver there enhances every aspect of American power 
and underwrites the design of the joint force. Competitors including China and Russia are seeking to 
challenge the United States’ advantage in space by developing weapons to deny or destroy U.S. space 
capabilities in conflict. The FY 2022 budget request strengthens our ability to deliver flexible 
capabilities and strategic options swiftly to outpace emerging threats in space. 
Priority areas in this budget include investment in a resilient architecture of capabilities for missile 
warning and missile tracking; modernization of all segments of GPS to ensure precision and availability; 
development of cyber-resilient space command-and-control capabilities that can integrate with Joint All-
Domain Command and Control; and investment in a broader base of domestic launch providers to 
further ensure our access to space.  
In cyberspace, the United States is facing increasingly aggressive activity, including strategic campaigns 
by competitors, other nation-states, and proxies seeking to undermine our national security and 
democracy. The FY 2022 budget invests in cybersecurity and cyberspace activities that build on the 
goals in DoD’s Cyber Strategy. The Cyber Operations portion of the budget supports U.S. Cyber 
Command’s operational element, the Cyber Mission Force, which performs cyberspace operations to 
defend the nation, support the joint force, and secure DoD infrastructure and networks.  
The budget also enhances our cybersecurity by mitigating key cyber deficiencies and strengthening our 
defensive capabilities to counter malicious attempts to exploit U.S. technology. Ultimately, we seek to 
improve joint force offensive capabilities to stay ahead of foreign threats.

Taking Care of Our People 
 
The dedicated men and women who make up the Department of Defense are the greatest strength and 
asset we have. That is why I have prioritized growing our talent, building resilience and readiness in the 
force, and ensuring appropriately accountable leadership as we address tough workforce issues.  
The FY 2022 budget request prioritizes improvements to recruiting, retention, training, and education, 
and support for military spouses, caregivers, survivors, and dependents. We are also intensely focused 
on ending sexual assault and harassment and identifying and addressing extremist behavior in the 
Department, two of my top priorities.   
 
We have established the Deputy’s Workforce Council, a senior-level governance forum co-chaired by 
the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is dedicated 
to addressing the most pressing people management, personnel policy, and total force requirements. This 
includes issues such as diversity, equity, and inclusion; military healthcare and childcare; sexual assault 
prevention and response; and more. This forum will ensure that workforce issues remain a critical 
priority for Department leadership, including the Secretaries of the Military Departments and our 
commanders, and will help bring the same vision and disciplined execution to workforce issues that the 
Department devotes to weapons systems and budgeting.    
 
Growing Our Talent 
 
We accomplish our mission far better when we look to the full range of talent that the United States has 
to offer. That means drawing on a diversity of experiences and backgrounds, which will help drive 
creative thinking and adaptation, innovation, and cultural understanding. These will be vital to meet the 
complex challenges of today and the future.  
Longstanding, systemic barriers for historically marginalized and underrepresented communities persist 
today. We must do all we can to ensure that we recruit and retain talent from the broadest pool of 
qualified, eligible candidates. 
This spring, we updated the Department’s policy on the open service of transgender people in the 
military. We welcome the recruitment, retention, and care of all qualified transgender individuals, and 
we look forward to their continued service with honor and dignity. The new policy reinforces that 
principle and also allows for a short implementation period for the Military Departments and Services to 
update their policies. 
We also must continually grow and develop our workforce and create new avenues for advancement to 
drive the promotion and retention of our outstanding next-generation leaders. That requires thinking 
about our critical skill sets with an eye to the future, in particular by recruiting and training individuals 
in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, and advanced technologies. 
Building Resilience and Readiness 
 
In building a resilient and ready force, we must recognize the key role that our military families play in 
supporting our personnel. The health and well-being of our service members and their families are 
inextricably linked to the readiness of our force, and we must do all we can to take care of them.   
10 
 
The effects of COVID-19 have been especially tough for our military families, putting a particular strain 
on those who have lost childcare or civilian employment. The FY 2022 budget expands our efforts to 
provide high-quality childcare to our military families, and we continue to provide virtual career support 
through Military OneSource.   
The budget also addresses efforts related to our military electronic health records, through which the 
Department is working to implement needed modernization most effectively. We must get military 
healthcare right for our service members and their families.   
We will also remain focused on addressing suicide and mental health issues in our joint force by 
enhancing services and support while seeking to reduce the stigma around seeking help.  
Ensuring Appropriately Accountable Leadership 
 
We must provide our workforce with a safe, secure, and welcoming environment that empowers them to 
do their best work and grow personally and professionally. At the most basic level, that means creating a 
workplace free of discrimination, hate, and harassment. It also means guaranteeing swift and clear 
accountability to anyone who does not live up to the highest standards of the Department. 
Sexual assault and harassment have no place in our country and no place in the Department of Defense. 
For too long, the Department’s leadership has tried to get a handle on this challenge, but we have not 
made significant progress. One case of sexual assault or harassment is too many, and we are losing the 
confidence of our junior enlisted personnel and officers because we have yet to make significant 
progress against this challenge.  
That is why, at the direction of the President, I established a 90-day Independent Review Commission 
(IRC) on sexual assault in the military. The IRC is responsible for reviewing DoD policies and processes 
related to sexual assault and harassment to determine where we can improve as a Department.  
The IRC will soon complete its work on all four lines of effort—accountability, prevention, climate and 
culture, and victim care and support. I recently received an initial set of recommendations from the IRC 
Chair and provided the Department the opportunity to review those recommendations. It is critically 
important that we get this right, and I am grateful for congressional partnership as we seek to do that.   
The vast majority of those who serve in uniform and their civilian colleagues do so with great honor and 
integrity. But extremism in our ranks can have an outsized impact on the Department, which will not be 
tolerated. The Department is focused on rooting out extremist behavior, and this fight is about our 
values, the Constitution, and the obligations in the Oath of Office we swear to uphold.  
Behavior that defies or degrades our core values erodes unit cohesion as well as good order and 
discipline. It can also damage the health, morale, and readiness of the workforce.  
I have moved immediately to meet this problem head-on. On February 5, I directed that within 60 days, 
commanding officers and supervisors at all levels conduct a one-day extremism stand-down to 
emphasize the importance of the Oath of Office we take, and to give military members and civilian 
employees the opportunity to participate in and continue to have this important conversation. 
11 
 
On April 9, I further directed several immediate actions to combat extremism, including reviews of what 
constitutes extremist activity, training for transitioning service members who may be targeted by 
extremist groups, and establishing the Countering Extremism Working Group to develop long-term 
recommendations to ensure all those who serve do so with honor and fealty to our values and our 
democracy. This must be a sustained effort, embraced by Department leadership. 
Succeeding Through Teamwork 
 
To accomplish anything we set out to do, the Department must operate as a unified team. That requires 
that we build unity among our leadership and ensure the right balance of civilian and military inputs to 
our decision-making and Department processes. In the last four months, we have made significant 
progress in rebuilding normal order in the Department to safeguard civilian oversight of the military.  
In particular, we have established several bodies aimed at supporting the efforts of our Deputy’s 
Management Action Group, the Department’s principal governance body for management actions, 
including resource management and planning, programming, budgeting, and execution.   
We have also established the Deputy’s Workforce Council to address the Department’s people 
management, personnel policy, and total force requirements, and task forces and working groups on 
COVID-19, China, climate change, and extremism.  
Protecting the United States requires teamwork at every level: state, local, tribal, territorial, and federal. 
It requires cooperation with all who have a stake in our national security, including Congress, private 
industry, civil society, and the American people. 
Our work to combat COVID-19 is a prime example of our commitment to working with our fellow 
Americans. Across the Executive Branch, DoD has worked closely with the Department of Homeland 
Security, including FEMA, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the State Department in 
efforts to end the pandemic. We are also investing in the defense industrial base to produce more 
personal protective equipment and test kits. And across the nation, we continue to work closely with the 
Department of Health and Human Services and State, local, tribal and territorial authorities to bring life-
saving vaccines to the American people. At all times, our support to the nation is reliant on our 
partnership with Congress, which plays an integral role in providing the authorities, appropriations, and 
leadership necessary to have the most effective Department of Defense.  
As part of our efforts to build teamwork into all we do, and in line with the President’s intent, we are 
also leading with diplomacy, our first national security tool of choice. I am committed to ensuring that 
the Department of Defense continues to field a credible force able to back up the hard work of our 
diplomats around the world. We are working in lock-step with the State Department and other 
departments and agencies, and I took my first trip as Secretary of Defense with Secretary Blinken to 
reassure our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region that this Administration is committed to our 
relationships there. Secretary Blinken and I also traveled to Europe to assure our allies and partners of 
our commitment to the region.  
When I traveled to NATO Headquarters earlier this spring, I shared a key message: we must consult 
together, decide together, and act together. Global crises, such as the pandemic, climate change, and 
12 
 
economic downturns, present significant dangers that span our borders. In many countries, internal 
strife, brought on by corruption, inequality and polarization, and transnational threats, such as violent 
extremism and criminal organizations, threaten stability around the alliance’s rim. In Afghanistan, we 
went in together and we will leave together, after a substantial consultative effort. Meanwhile, 
aggressive and coercive behaviors from emboldened strategic competitors such as China and Russia 
reinforce the importance of collective security.  
Conclusion 
 
The challenges we face are many, but the Department stands ready to defend the United States against 
any enemy, foreign or domestic, just as we always have. We remain resolute in our commitment to 
protect the nation and will not shy away from any challenge. 
The FY 2022 budget will help us fulfill that responsibility, and we are grateful for your support in 
working with us as we build the Department of the future. We need your help. 
We also remain grateful for the tremendous trust that the United States places in our soldiers, sailors, 
airmen, Marines, guardians, and DoD civilian employees, all of whom will continue to defend our 
democracy, our people, and our way of life. Thanks to them, we will always operate from a position of 
strength. Thank you.

TESTIMONY 
THE HONORABLE PETER BUTTIGIEG 
SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION 
BEFORE THE 
APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE ON 
TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING, AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND 
RELATED AGENCIES 
UNITED STATES SENATE 
June 16, 2021 
 
Chairman Schatz, Ranking Member Collins, and members of the 
Subcommittee: thank you for the opportunity to discuss the 
President’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget request for the Department 
of Transportation. I also want to thank the members of this 
subcommittee for your strong support of our Department and its 
programs, which help keep the American people safe every day. 
 
The Department of Transportation plays a crucial role in 
maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure that powers our 
economy and keeps us moving. Yet, as we’ve seen in recent 
months, such as with the I-40 bridge shutdown, much of our 
infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. In some cases, we are 
relying on roads, bridges, railroads, ports, and waterway 
infrastructure built a century ago. In addition, our transportation 
infrastructure and systems are not sufficiently designed to 
mitigate or be resilient to the impacts of climate change. If we 
want to grow our economy, remain competitive, and address the 
climate crisis, we need to take swift and bold action. 
 
     
 
     
 
At this moment of challenge and opportunity, President Biden’s 
first Fiscal Year 2022 budget request to Congress reflects that 
urgent need, as well as our values and priorities. The request 
includes $88 billion to support transportation priorities 
throughout the nation. These resources will enable the 
Department to continue funding its current portfolio of 
programs, while also revitalizing transit and rail, and making 
necessary improvements to our aviation infrastructure.  
 
The President’s proposal also includes a funding request for the 
American Jobs Plan: a once-in-a-generation investment in 
repairing and transforming our infrastructure, which will create 
millions of good-paying jobs and keep our economy moving 
forward for decades to come.  
 
It contains an additional $621 billion for long-overdue repairs 
and improvements for our highways, transit systems, rail, ports, 
aviation, and more.   
  
The details of the President’s budget request advance the vision 
of the American Jobs Plan, and underscore our commitment to 
key priorities: improving safety, building economic strength, 
addressing the climate crisis, advancing equity, and supporting 
innovation.   
  
Let me share some of the highlights of this budget request when 
it comes to transportation.   
     
 
     
 
 
As always, promoting safety for the hundreds of millions of 
Americans who rely on our transportation system is this 
Department’s “North Star.” And safety is embedded throughout 
this budget request.    
 
The President is requesting $18.5 billion for the Federal 
Aviation Administration, including $17.4 million to strengthen 
Aviation Safety Oversight and begin addressing the 
requirements of the Aircraft Certification Safety and 
Accountability Act.  
 
FAA will also receive $1 billion to improve the facilities that 
house the workforce and technology at the heart of our air traffic 
control system. Many of these facilities were built in the 1960s 
and are in dire need of replacement or repair. This funding will 
reduce the current backlog and help ensure our air traffic 
controllers have an efficient, modern workplace to carry out 
their mission of keeping the skies safe.  
 
The budget also includes $246 million—over a $50 million 
increase—for the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration’s Vehicle Safety Programs. These programs help 
advance safety innovations to keep pace with the rapid 
development of vehicle electronics and automated driving 
systems. This funding will also help to mitigate carbon 
pollution, by enforcing the highest achievable fuel-economy 
standards and ensuring that alternative fuel vehicles are safe.  
     
 
     
 
 
With respect to transit, the President’s request includes $2.5 
billion for Capital Investment Grants—a $459 million 
increase—to accelerate existing transit projects and support new 
ones. These increases will help us advance cleaner vehicles, 
while creating jobs that benefit our economy.  
 
The President’s budget includes $2.7 billion for Amtrak, 
representing a 35% increase. This support will accelerate track 
renewal, renovate aging stations, refresh the existing capital 
fleet, and help address maintenance backlogs throughout the 
system. Along with $625 million for a competitive new 
Passenger Rail Improvement, Modernization, and Expansion 
program—known as PRIME Grants—these investments will 
modernize passenger rail service and grow existing rail corridors 
throughout the country.   
 
To encourage innovative transportation projects that are tailored 
to fit local needs, the President’s request continues $1 billion in 
funding for the flexible and oversubscribed RAISE grants. This 
popular, competitive grant program provides much-needed 
federal funding to help localities that are working on innovative, 
modern infrastructure projects. 
 
Finally, I want to mention the $110 million requested for a new 
“Thriving Communities” program that will establish a new 
office to help communities eliminate transportation barriers and 
     
 
     
 
improve access to jobs, schools, and businesses. This program 
aims to ensure that all Americans have access to fair, equitable, 
affordable transportation options. 
 
These are just a few of the items in the President’s 2022 budget 
request, which, together with the American Jobs Plan, will help 
keep Americans safe and moving, make the necessary 
investments to tackle the climate crisis, and provide the 
foundation for economic prosperity.   
 
Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today.  
I look forward to answering your questions.

Fiscal Year 2022 Department of Defense Budget Request for  
Energy, Installations, and Environment Programs 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
June 16, 2021 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Chairman Heinrich, Ranking Member Boozman, and distinguished members of the 
Subcommittee: Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Department of Defense’s (DoD) 
posture as it relates to energy, installations, and environment in the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 
2022 budget request. 
 
Our installations remain one of our primary weapon systems. For nearly 80 years, we have been 
able to operate from our bases around the world with near-impunity, which has afforded us 
unprecedented power projection capabilities. However, the stark reality is that the homeland is 
no longer a sanctuary. Therefore, we must ensure that our installations are not only postured to 
support the Joint Force, but that they are resilient against the full range of man-made and natural 
threats. The FY2022 President’s Budget Request supports our efforts to address these resilience 
challenges, while also addressing mission requirements and ensuring Service members have a 
safe and resilient place to live and work.  
 
KEY AREAS OF CONCERN 
 
Before I review the details of the budget request, I would like to provide updates on two key 
issues, specifically climate change and the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI). 
 
Climate Change 
 
In the words of Secretary Austin, the Department faces a “growing climate crisis that is 
impacting our missions, plans, and capabilities and must be met by ambitious, immediate 
action.” Climate change will continue to amplify operational demands on the force, degrade 
installations and infrastructure, increase health risks to our service members, and require 
modifications to much of our existing and planned equipment. Extreme weather events are 
already costing the Department billions of dollars and those costs are likely to increase as climate 
change accelerates.  
 
As the Department’s Chief Sustainability Officer, ASD(Sustainment) oversaw the development 
of the DoD Climate Adaptation Plan (CAP), that was developed per Executive Order (EO) 
14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, and will be finalized later this month.  
The CAP identifies five lines of effort: Climate-Informed Decision-Making; Train, Test, and 
Equip a Climate-Ready Force; Resilient Built and Natural Infrastructure; Supply Chain 
Resilience and Innovation; and Enhance Adaptation and Resilience Through Collaboration. The 
four cross-cutting enablers for these lines of effort are continuous monitoring and data analytics, 
innovation, climate literacy, and environmental justice.  
 
To enhance the oversight and execution of these initiatives, the Department recently established 
the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Defense for Environment and Energy Resilience with 
OASD(Sustainment). Given the alignment between mission and climate priorities and the 
energy-related nature of climate initiatives, this integrated team is ideally positioned to review, 
prioritize, and oversee the Department’s holistic climate and energy portfolio. The FY2022 
President’s Budget request increases resources, staff, and expertise needed to achieve the goals 
of the Secretary of Defense and the President.  
 
1 
 
Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) 
 
Under the overall direction of the Chief Housing Officer, the Department has made significant 
progress implementing actions to enhance the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) 
program, consistent with our commitment to ensuring that MHPI projects provide safe, quality, 
well-maintained housing where our members and their families will want and choose to live.  
 
The Department continues to prioritize MHPI reform actions that will improve the tenant 
experience, rebuild tenant trust, and maintain MHPI housing project financial viability. This 
includes implementing MHPI reforms enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization 
Acts for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 and FY2021, including requirements for a Tenant Bill of Rights, 
a universal lease, a dispute resolution process, and other elements.  
 
Our initial phase has predominantly focused on implementing the MHPI Tenant Bill of Rights 
and the NDAA requirements imbedded in those rights, as a visible commitment to military 
members and their families. Based on our efforts to date, the Department has issued all policy 
guidance necessary to implement all rights at all MHPI housing projects.  
 
As Congress recognized in the FY2020 NDAA, retroactive application of the requirements at 
existing projects requires voluntary agreement by the respective MHPI company; the Department 
cannot unilaterally change the deal terms of the complex, public-private partnerships that 
established the MHPI projects. Nearly all of the MHPI companies have agreed to implement all 
eighteen tenant rights at their existing projects; however, the final right – standard documentation 
(focused on a universal lease framework) – is available at more than 30 installations with MHPI 
housing; with few exceptions, we expect all eighteen tenant rights to be fully available by the 
end of FY2021.  
 
The Department issued housing policies to reinforce and expand the Department’s programmatic 
oversight over MHPI housing projects, focusing on five key aspects that include: 1) senior leader 
engagement to collaborate internally and with MHPI companies on housing issues and necessary 
corrective actions; 2) rebuilding trust with military members and their families; 3) accountability 
at all levels within DoD and by MHPI companies to perform our oversight as originally intended 
at the outset of housing privatization; 4) transparency and more frequent communication with 
MHPI Tenants; and 5) ensuring the long-term financial viability of the MHPI projects and MHPI 
program. Further, the Department recently established a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense 
for Housing to enhance execution of the statutorily-defined Chief Housing Officer duties and 
responsibilities. 
 
Our priority going forward is to implement the remaining MHPI reform provisions that improve 
safety, quality, and maintenance of the privatized housing, and to ensure accountability at all 
levels within DoD and the MHPI companies to perform our oversight as originally intended at 
the outset of housing privatization.   
 
The Department of Defense understands that family is important and honors the sacrifice that 
military members and their families make to serve our nation. We recognize the environment 
where Service members (and their families) live impacts their quality of life, their ability to do 
their jobs, and the Department's ability to recruit and retain the force. We are committed to 
working closely with you and the committee staff to ensure the long-term success of the MHPI 
2 
 
program, and will continue to remain diligent in our oversight to ensure delivery of quality 
housing for military members and their families over the life of the projects. 
 
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND FAMILY HOUSING 
 
The President’s FY2022 budget requests $9.8 billion for the Military Construction (MilCon) and 
Family Housing appropriation. This represents a $2.0 billion or 26% increase from the FY2021 
budget request of $7.8 billion.  
 
The request reflects the Department’s priorities in supporting the Administration’s Interim 
National Security Strategy to address critical mission requirements and life, health, and safety 
concerns within the current fiscal environment. In addition to new construction needed to 
recapitalize the nuclear enterprise, this funding will be used to restore and modernize enduring 
facilities to enhance their resilience to climate events and promotes elimination of excess or 
obsolete facilities. The FY2022 MilCon request includes projects that directly support 
operations, training, maintenance, production, and projects to take care of our people and their 
families, such as medical treatment facilities, unaccompanied personnel housing, and schools. 
 
Military Construction 
 
We are requesting $8.4 billion in the budget for Military Construction across the Department, an 
increase of 30% from last year’s request, primarily due to infrastructure requirements for the 
beddown of the B-21 aircraft, investments in KC-46A depot maintenance facilities, recruit 
dormitories, F-35A facilities in the United Kingdom, continued Guam relocation efforts, 
investments in the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Program, and the inclusion of previously 
deferred Section 2808 projects (16 projects totaling $661 million). Slightly more than half of this 
request provides readiness improvements in facilities to support operations, training, 
maintenance and production, and supply. Another $1.1 billion funds medical facilities, troop 
housing, and community support, and $206 million funds DoD’s continued support to the NATO 
Security Investment Program.  
 
This request also includes $2 billion for the Defense-Wide Components, including  
  $192 million for dependent educational facilities 
  $110 million for fuel infrastructure; 
  $238 million for recapitalization of National Security Agency facilities;  
  $304 million to address new capabilities/mission, force structure growth, and 
infrastructure for Special Operations Forces;  
  $51 million for Washington Headquarters Services facilities; and  
  $247 million for the Energy Resilience and Conservation Investment Program. 
 
In addition, the Defense-Wide request contains $508 million for medical facility recapitalization 
including $153 million for the fifth increment (of a $695 million project) for the Walter Reed 
Medical Center Addition/Alteration; $160 million for the fourth increment (of a $381 million) 
for a new hospital at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri; $73 million for three veterinary treatment 
facilities; and $122 million for four smaller medical treatment facilities. These projects are 
critical for our continued delivery of the quality health care that our service members and their 
families deserve. 
 
3 
 
Facilities Sustainment and Recapitalization 
 
Facilities sustainment represents the Department’s largest category of facilities spending by 
providing for the regularly-scheduled maintenance and repair or replacement of facility 
components. These ongoing and predictable investments must be made throughout the service 
life of a facility to optimize its performance and support the safety, productivity, and quality of 
life of our personnel, while also reducing avoidable costs associated with premature 
deterioration.  
 
The Department’s FY2022 budget request includes $12.3 billion for the Military Services and 
the major Defense-wide organizations. This represents a sharp increase from the $11.3 billion in 
the FY2021 budget request but a slight decrease in the overall sustainment rate from 83 percent 
to 81 percent due to increased sustainment requirements resulting from a combination of higher 
sustainment costs, increased inventory, and the inclusion of costs for project design and 
standardized facility inspections.  
 
In addition to facilities sustainment funding, the Department relies upon its Restoration and 
Modernization (R&M) program funding to provide ongoing support to assigned missions by 
countering obsolescence and reversing degraded conditions of existing facilities. The 
Department’s FY2022 budget request includes $4.0 billion in Operations and Maintenance 
appropriations for facilities R&M, a slight decrease compared to our $4.3 billion FY2021 budget 
request. 
 
Family and Unaccompanied Housing 
 
One of the Department’s principal priorities is to support military personnel and their families 
and improve their quality of life by ensuring access to suitable, affordable housing. Service 
members are engaged in the front lines of protecting our national security and they deserve the 
best possible living and working conditions. Sustaining the quality of life of our people is crucial 
to recruitment, retention, readiness and morale.  
 
Our FY2022 budget request includes $1.4 billion to fund construction, operation, and 
maintenance of government-owned and leased family housing worldwide; provide housing 
referral services to assist military members in renting or buying private sector housing; and 
oversight of privatized family housing. The FY2022 request is $72 million (5.3%) higher than 
the FY2021 request, and $22 million (1.6%) higher than the FY2021 enacted amount to sustain 
our increased focus on ensuring the delivery and maintenance of quality housing for military 
families. The FY2022 request includes $293.2 million for construction and improvements to 
meet the Department’s goal to maintain at least 90 percent of the world-wide Family Housing 
inventory at Good and Fair condition levels, to include $92.3 million for construction of 130 
Army housing units at Vicenza, Italy. The O&M budget request of $1.12 billion represents a 
$38.4 million (3.5%) increase compared to the FY2021 request. This funding request supports 
more than 34,000 government-owned family housing units, most of which are on enduring bases 
in overseas locations, and approximately 5,800 government-leased family housing units where 
government-owned or privatized housing is unavailable. The requested funding will ensure that 
U.S. military personnel and their families continue to have suitable housing choices. 
 
4 
 
The Department’s FY2022 budget request demonstrates our continued commitment to modernize 
Unaccompanied Personnel Housing (UPH) to improve privacy and provide greater amenities. 
The FY2022 budget request includes more than $477 million for eight construction projects that 
will improve living conditions for permanent party personnel. This includes $81 million for an 
Army barracks complex at Fort Meade, Maryland; $172 million for two Air Force dormitory 
projects at Joint Base San Antonio, Texas, and $43 million for a Navy barracks project in Joint 
Region Marianas, Guam.   
 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS 
 
Installations are key platforms for our nation’s defense. We must maintain our ability to conduct 
realistic training and flexible operations. The Department’s environmental investments support 
this objective through activities ranging from managing critical habitat and avoiding training 
restrictions to addressing drinking water health advisories and making the best use of our cleanup 
dollars. The President’s FY2022 Budget requests $3.6 billion for environmental programs, 
keeping pace with our FY2021 request. 
 
Defense Environmental Restoration Programs 
 
We are requesting $1.3 billion to continue cleanup efforts at the remaining Installation 
Restoration Program (IRP) sites and Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP) sites. The 
IRP is focused on cleanup of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants, while the 
MMRP is focused on responding to unexploded ordnance and munition constituents at former 
military ranges. This includes $1.0 billion for “Environmental Restoration,” which encompasses 
active installations and Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS – sites that DoD transferred to other 
Federal agencies, States, local governments, or private landowners before October 17, 1986). 
The remaining $264 million is for “BRAC Environmental.” 
 
Progress Towards Cleanup Goals 
Goal: Achieve Response Complete at 90% and 95% of Active and BRAC IRP and MMRP 
sites, and FUDS IRP sites, by FY 2018 and FY2021, respectively 
 
Status as of the end  Status as of the end  Projected status at 
of FY2019  of FY2020  the end of FY2021 
Army  91%  91%  92% 
Navy  83%  83%  84% 
Air Force  88%  85%  86% 
DLA  84%  84%  85% 
FUDS  87%  88%  89% 
Total  88%  87%  88% 
 
By the end of FY2020, the Department, in cooperation with State agencies and the 
Environmental Protection Agency, completed cleanup activities at 87 percent of Active and 
BRAC IRP and MMRP sites, and FUDS IRP sites, and is now monitoring the results. During 
FY2020 alone, the Department completed cleanup at 312 sites. Of the roughly 40,000 restoration 
sites, more than 33,900 are now in monitoring status or have completed cleanup. 
 
Our focus remains on continuous improvement in the restoration program: minimizing overhead, 
adopting new technologies to reduce cost and accelerate cleanup, refining and standardizing our 
5 
 
cost estimating, and improving our relationships with State regulators through increased 
dialogue. All of these initiatives help ensure that we make the best use of our available resources 
to complete cleanup. 
 
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a top priority and may cause the DoD to reopen 
previously-made decisions, which could cause delays in achieving our goals. Additionally, some 
sites have no feasible solution for cleanup and, as a result, the Department is making significant 
investments in environmental technology to identify new potential remediation methods. 
 
Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances 
 
The presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the environment is a national 
issue due to its wide-spread use in many industrial and consumer products. The Department 
recognizes the importance of this issue and is committed to addressing PFAS in a deliberative, 
holistic, and transparent manner, as we continue to pursue a PFAS-free fire-fighting alternative 
and address our PFAS releases.  
 
The PFAS Task Force 
 
The Department established a PFAS Task Force in July 2019. This Task Force provides strategic 
leadership and direction to ensure a coordinated, aggressive, and holistic approach on DoD-wide 
efforts to address PFAS. The Task Force continues unchanged and is postured to be responsive 
to the direction of this Administration. The Task Force continues to focus on four main goals: 
  Mitigating and eliminating the use of the current aqueous film forming foam (AFFF); 
  Fulfilling our cleanup responsibilities, and 
  Understanding the impacts of PFAS on human health 
  Public outreach 
 
AFFF Replacement Research 
 
AFFF formulations in use by DoD today do not contain detectable amounts of PFOS or PFOA, 
but they still contain PFAS. We have an aggressive initiative to develop and demonstrate PFAS-
free alternatives for AFFF. We have identified a number of commercially-available and 
developmental PFAS-free alternative formulations that have acceptable fire extinguishment 
performance against jet fuel fires. Evaluation of the aging, materials compatibility, and toxicity 
of these formulations is underway. The Department is committed to finding an effective 
firefighting alternative that meets the life-saving performance standards of AFFF and does not 
have negative health or environmental effects. 
 
PFAS Cleanup and Drinking Water Mitigation 
 
DoD follows the existing federal cleanup law (Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)) and the long-standing EPA regulations for all 
chemicals in our cleanup program, including PFAS. The Defense Environmental Restoration 
Program statute provides authorities to DoD to perform and fund cleanup actions and requires 
they be carried out in accordance with CERCLA.  
 
6 
 
As of March 31, 2021, the Department has identified 698 installations where DoD used or 
potentially released PFAS. DoD has completed the initial assessment at 129 of these installations 
and of those, 63 were found to require no further action, while 66 are proceeding to the next step 
in the CERCLA process. During these initial assessments, DoD evaluates both groundwater and 
drinking water. If DoD identifies PFOS and/or PFOA from DoD activities in off-base drinking 
water above EPA’s LHA, we quickly take action (i.e., a CERCLA removal action) to provide 
treatment or an alternative water source.  
 
In addition, as part of our normal operations, the Department has sampled over 500 on-base DoD 
drinking water systems worldwide. Of those, we identified 34 with PFOS and/or PFOA above 
EPA’s LHA and took quick action to bring those systems below 70 ppt. As of today, no one is 
drinking water above EPA’s lifetime HA of 70ppt where DoD is the known source. 
 
Environmental Technology 
 
The overall FY2022 budget request for Environmental Technology is $131.9 million, centered 
on two key programs: the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program 
(SERDP) and the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP). These 
Defense-wide environmental technology programs coordinate closely with the Military Services 
to ensure research, demonstration, test and evaluation are focused on the Departments most 
pressing environmental needs. Our request for SERDP, which is focused on basic and applied 
research, is $51.9 million. For ESTCP, which is focused on validating more mature technologies 
to transition them to widespread use, we are requesting $31.5 million for environmental 
technology demonstrations and $39.9 million for energy technology demonstrations.  
 
These programs have already achieved impactful results and have the potential to significantly 
reduce long-term costs by implementing new ways of treating sediment and groundwater 
contamination, to increase installation resilience by providing effective tools to planning staff to 
anticipate the impacts of climate change, and to reduce the life-cycle costs of multiple weapons 
systems through development and demonstration of innovative coatings and materials that avoid 
increasingly unavailable hazardous elements. 
 
SERDP/ESTCP continue to invest in alternatives to incineration for disposal of AFFF-related 
per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and development of analytical methods for PFAS in 
media other than drinking water in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency. In 
the critical area of installation energy, we are focused on proving technologies and solutions that 
cost-effectively incorporate energy storage into installation-level microgrids to improve the 
energy security and resiliency of our installations. 
 
The Native American Lands Environmental Mitigation Program 
 
Our budget request includes $12 million for the Native American Lands Environmental 
Mitigation Program (NALEMP) to address environmental impacts to Indian lands, Alaska Native 
Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA)-conveyed properties, and tribal treaty rights attributable to past 
DoD activities. Impacts are typically associated with hazardous materials, munitions debris, 
underground fuel storage tanks, unsafe buildings, lead-based paint and asbestos, and abandoned 
equipment. Most Indian lands and ANCSA-conveyed properties are located in rural and remote 
areas with low population densities; thus, they might not qualify as high priority sites under

DoD’s traditional environmental restoration programs. The NALEMP seeks to bridge the gap 
between tribal needs and these traditional risk-based environmental restoration programs and 
incorporate tribal priorities to address potential impacts to Indian lands, ANCSA-conveyed 
properties, and tribal treaty rights. The goal of the NALEMP is to complete mitigation of sites by 
restoring health and human safety, protecting natural resources, protecting cultural resources, and 
returning tribal lands to optimal use.  
 
Under the NALEMP, the DoD fosters government-to-government relationships with tribes 
through a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and then enters into two-year Cooperative 
Agreements (CAs) with the tribal governments. Funding provided through CAs enables tribal 
governments to lead NALEMP projects, incorporate “traditional ecological knowledge” into 
design for cleanup, and build tribal capacity regarding environmental services and technical 
remediation skills. Tribal governments conduct the cleanup with technical assistance and 
mentorship from DoD and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  
 
Eighty-eight sites in the lower 48 states and Alaska have been fully mitigated. Ninety percent of 
the 1,000+ potential tribal impacts reported to DoD have been assessed and 294 have been found 
eligible for NALEMP or are under review. In FY2020, DoD executed a total of 13 NALEMP 
CAs, of which nine CAs were with Alaska Native tribes and four with Pueblo Indian tribes in 
New Mexico. By the end of FY2021, DoD will execute an additional 16 CAs, of which 11 CAs 
will be with Alaska Native tribes and five Indian tribes in the lower 48 states. 
 
Environmental Conservation and Compatible Development 
 
The Department’s lands and waters are vital to readiness. However, they also support a diverse 
array of fish and wildlife species, as well as significant historic sites and resources. DoD lands 
provided habitats for nearly 500 that are federally protected under the Endangered Species Act, 
over 130,000 recorded archaeological sites, and 45 National Historic Landmarks. Our $577 
million request for Conservation will allow us to protect these resources in compliance with 
applicable federal statues, and manage for healthy and resilient natural landscapes to reduce 
climate driven risks such as flooding and wildfire.  
 
Regulatory protections related to threatened and endangered species and their habitats continue 
to pose significant mission challenges by restricting use of our existing ranges and training areas, 
or limiting our development of new infrastructure. However, these investments in conservation 
are making significant progress towards alleviating these restrictions by promoting species 
recovery. In partnership with the Department of the Interior and US Fish and Wildlife Service, 
DoD has worked to identify priority species and conservation actions which has led to the 
proposed down-listing or de-listing of 10 species affecting 20 military installations. Building on 
this success, we will continue to work with our federal, state and non-governmental partners to 
develop new and innovative regulatory approaches that streamline processes and provide greater 
mission flexibility.  
 
Additionally, developing and implementing climate adaptation and resilience into both the 
natural and cultural resource programs will be a priority moving forward. Using the data and 
information currently available through the Defense Climate Assessment Tool (DCAT) and 
emerging adaptation planning guidance related to natural and cultural resource management 
programs, the DoD will be evaluating the use of nature based solutions, and sustaining our 
8 
 
natural infrastructure to address climate driven risks such as restoring salt marshes or wetlands to 
reduce flood risk, or altering forest management practices to reduce fire risks.  
 
Continued investments in conservation will maximize our flexibility to use our land, water, and 
airspace for military purposes and to address incompatible land uses beyond our fence lines, and 
will ensure that our military and civilian personnel have the access they need to conduct mission-
essential activities. Strategies to address these conservation and climate adaptation priorities can 
be most effective through landscape-scale initiatives to better capitalize on both our on-
installation conservation programs and our off-installation conservation partnerships through the 
Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) Program.  
 
The Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) program 
 
Of the Department’s $577 million budget for conservation, $150 million is directed to the 
Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) program. REPI uniquely supports 
DoD’s ability to seamlessly operate across domains by stimulating innovative and diverse 
partnerships between local communities, federal and state agencies, and non-governmental 
organizations to limit incompatible development and promote climate resilience around our 
installations and ranges. Through FY2020, DoD has leveraged $1.08 billion with over $975 
million in non-DoD partner contributions to protect over 757,000 acres of land across 115 
installations in 35 states and territories. 
 
The increased request for FY2022 will allow the REPI program to build capacity and 
significantly expand projects that promote resilience to climate change. This includes 
opportunities that maintain and improve “natural infrastructure,” implementing solutions outside 
installation boundaries to enhance the benefits provided by natural systems. Natural 
infrastructure solutions encompass a wide range of possible actions that can help promote 
installation resilience, preserve access to critical installation and range assets and capabilities, 
and enhance DoD’s core training, testing and operational missions. 
 
The FY2022 funding will also enable increased investment in the Pacific region, preserving and 
enhancing key mission capabilities critical to deterring adversaries in the Pacific, including 
missile defense; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; and joint force capabilities. In the 
Pacific region alone, DoD and its partners have invested over $136 million at seven REPI 
projects across Hawaii, Alaska, and Guam. 
 
Finally, the increased funding will enable DoD to expand the interagency Sentinel Landscapes 
Partnership between DoD, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of the 
Interior. The Partnership promotes shared land use priorities, and works to identify landscapes 
across the country where the missions of the federal agencies – strengthening national defense, 
promoting sustainable agriculture and forestry, and building community resilience to climate 
change – intersect. From FY 2012 to FY2019, DoD has contributed $141 million and leveraged 
$542 million in funds from federal, state, local, and private partners to advance the goals and 
shared land use priorities of the seven sentinel landscapes. In cooperation with our federal 
partners, DoD intends to designate additional Sentinel landscapes in FY2022.

Military Aviation and Installation Assurance Siting Clearinghouse 
 
The Military Aviation and Installation Assurance Siting Clearinghouse continues to protect the 
Department’s ability to train, test, and operate as the nation expands its renewable and other 
commercial energy and power transmission capacity. Commercial wind development typically 
poses the greatest compatibility challenge to DoD due to physical obstruction of low-level flight 
routes and electromagnetic interference with DoD radar systems. DoD resolved project concerns 
though collaboration among the Clearinghouse, the Military Departments, local communities, 
states, and energy developers, thereby maintaining the Department’s ability to train, test, and 
operate while enabling development of alternative energy resources. DoD negotiated and signed 
29 Mitigation Agreements with wind energy developers to minimize the impacts from proposed 
projects on DoD missions. Through our collaborative efforts, none of the proposed projects 
warranted a DoD objection to the Secretary of Transportation or Administrator of the FAA. 
 
The Department is actively implementing new approaches to protect DoD missions. The 
Clearinghouse intensified efforts to advocate for state-level legislation to protect military 
installations and operations from incompatible wind energy development. Indiana, Wyoming, 
and Alabama have passed protections for military missions in wind turbine permitting. Although 
DoD and developers have had success resolving issues related to incompatible energy 
development, state support is invaluable in the rare cases where developers choose not to 
voluntarily coordinate with DoD.   
 
The Department has developed active interactions with the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
Management (BOEM) to manage increasing plans for offshore energy development. The 
Clearinghouse, Department of Interior, and BOEM have updated and implemented offshore 
review practices to allow for DoD input at every stage of planning, permitting and development. 
 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ENERGY PROGRAMS 
 
The FY2022 President’s Budget aligns with direction from the President and the Secretary of 
Defense to ensure installations and forces are resilient in the face of a wide range of challenges 
to include climate change, disruptions to energy or water supplies, and direct physical or cyber-
attacks. The FY2022 President’s Budget includes approximately $4.4 billion in energy 
investments, including both installation energy (the energy used to power permanent installations 
and non-tactical fleet vehicles) and operational energy (the energy required for training, moving, 
and sustaining military forces and weapons platforms for military operations). Achieving Joint 
lethality, forward force maneuver and posture resilience, and resilient and agile logistics in 
support of military combat operations, each require the Department to reconsider the assured 
availability of fuel and power around the globe.  
 
In support of operational energy resilience, the Department is requesting $3.2 billion to upgrade 
and procure new vehicles and aircraft, increase the range and endurance of platforms, enhance 
energy resiliency at contingency bases, and plan and execute wargames to account for increasing 
risks to logistics and sustainment. As the Department prepares to operate in contested 
environments around the globe, these investments increase range, endurance, and lethality while 
decreasing risks to warfighters. 
 
10 
 
In support of installation resilience, we are requesting $1.2 billion for energy resilience and 
energy conservation initiatives, most of which are directed to existing buildings. This includes 
$595 million in the Services’ operation & maintenance accounts for sustainment and 
recapitalization projects, which generally involve retrofits to install improved lighting, high-
efficiency HVAC systems, double-pane windows, facility related control systems (FRCS), and 
new roofs. In addition, the Energy Resilience and Conservation Investment Program (ERCIP) 
provides $287 million in military construction funding, including planning and design, to 
enhance energy resilience through installing microgrids with renewable and clean energy 
generation and energy storage alternatives and projects that will improve energy efficiency at our 
installations. In particular, the FY2022 request includes $10 million in ERCIP design funds 
specifically to plan and design projects to enable the installation of electrical vehicle charging 
stations in support of the President’s Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at 
Home and Abroad, which requires the Department to electrify its non-tactical vehicle fleet.  
 
Threats to Energy 
 
Energy is an essential enabler of military capability, and the Department depends on energy-
resilient forces, weapon systems, and facilities to achieve its mission. At home and abroad, 
installations are reliant on commercial, municipal, and host nation power grids for day-to-day 
operations, including command and control systems, communications, lighting, heating, and 
cooling. Similarly, the Department relies on organic capabilities and commercial partners to 
provide refined petroleum products to globally deployed forces, and maximizes the use of local 
sources to minimize the time, resources, and effort associated with acquiring, moving, and 
delivering fuel to deployed forces. 
 
Adversaries recognize the strengths of U.S. power projection and sustainment, and possess long–
range weapons, significant anti–access/area–denial (A2/AD) systems, and substantial cyber 
capabilities able to degrade the ability of the Department to provide energy to forces and 
facilities. In response to these threats and in alignment with statute, the Department shall “ensure 
readiness of the armed forces for their military missions by pursuing energy security and energy 
resilience” (10 U.S.C. § 2911) and “ensure the types, availability, and use of operational energy 
promote the readiness of the armed forces” (10 USC § 2926).  
 
In addition, the Department’s ability to provide energy to critical missions is affected by the 
climate. A climate-resilient supply chain is one in which the Department has ensured that key 
suppliers and industries can still operate though impacted by climate change, with special 
attention given to “last-mile” resilience.  
 
Enterprise-wide Energy Initiatives 
 
Facing the imperative to sustain critical operations in contested environments while also 
reducing our carbon footprint, the Department is implementing a series of initiatives to enhance 
the use of power or fuel and support informed decision-making with regard to investments and 
future force capabilities. In partnership with the Joint Staff, Defense Agencies, and the Services, 
the Department is pursuing the following initiatives to transform how the Department considers 
energy in planning and operations:  
 
 
11 
 
10 U.S.C. §2912 Energy Cost Savings 
 
With the passage of the FY2020 and FY2021 National Defense Authorization Acts, 10 U.S.C. 
§2912 now allows the Military Departments to retain amounts equal to installation and 
operational energy cost savings in order to fund additional energy resilience, energy efficiency, 
and installation quality of life projects. In FY2019 and FY2020, the Military Departments piloted 
efforts to retain $115 million in installation energy cost savings and $20 million in operational 
energy cost savings using the authority. Presently, OASD(Sustainment) is supporting pilot 
initiatives by Military Departments to implement this authority across both installation and 
operational energy activities, pursuant to the statute and DoD financial regulations. 
 
Integrating Climate Mitigation Considerations into DoD Procurement 
 
While the Department has procured sustainable goods and services for many years, the 
Department now is preparing to consider greenhouse gas emissions in a broader set of energy 
procurement decisions. For instance, based on Executive Order 14008, the Department is 
evaluating how to procure carbon-free electricity for our installations. The Deputy Secretary of 
Defense also tasked OASD(Sustainment) to develop policy recommendations for the application 
of the social cost of carbon into DoD procurement. Finally, the FY2022 President’s Budget 
provided an additional $2.0 million to support additional testing and qualification of drop-in 
compatible alternative fuels already in commercial use to ensure the Department’s ability to use 
any drop-in compatible fuels available in the global marketplace.  
 
Operational Energy Resilience 
 
In FY2020, the Department consumed nearly 78 million barrels of fuel to power ships, aircraft, 
combat vehicles, and contingency bases at a total cost of $9.2 billion. To respond to the needs of 
a global force, the Department purchased 48% of this fuel outside of the U.S. Beyond liquid 
fuels, the Department also is relying on advanced energy storage to enable long-range, 
autonomous, directed energy, high-power sensors, and other warfighting capabilities across air, 
sea, and land domains.  
 
The Department depends on the resilient delivery of energy to forces, weapon systems, and 
facilities around the globe. To prepare for peer competition where even the homeland is 
contested, the Department is addressing a range of technological, operational, and policy 
initiatives to enhance the use of energy in warfighting. 
 
Investments in Operational Energy 
 
FY2022 President’s Budget significantly enhances resources dedicated to reducing operational 
energy risks and applying energy technologies to improve warfighter capabilities. Relative to the 
FY21 President’s Budget, these operational energy enhancements include: 
 
  Operational Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF): +$74.3 million 
  Operational Energy Prototyping Fund (OEPF): +$23.2 million 
  Alternative Fuels Certification: +$2 million 
  Air Force/Navy Operations and Planning Tools: +$38.6 million 
  Air Force Large Aircraft Drag Reduction: +$14.1 million 
12 
 
  Navy Platform and Propulsion Upgrades: +$19.5 million  
  Army Tactical Vehicle Electrification: +$5.2 million 
 
The Department also uses the budget certification authority in 10 U.S.C. §2926 to quantify 
operational energy investments across the Military Departments and Defense Agencies and 
evaluate the alignment of the President’s Budget with the operational energy strategy. 
ASD(Sustainment) judged the FY22 President’s Budget as sufficient to meet the previous 
operational energy strategy and will provide this assessment to the Congress by the end of July 
2021. As the Department develops a revised energy strategy that reflects the new guidance 
related to resilience and climate, the ASD(Sustainment) will use the budget certification 
authority to rigorously review the sufficiency and direction of investments in operational energy 
resilience. 
 
Contested Logistics and Risks to Energy 
 
To ensure that energy considerations are included in Joint and Service capability development 
and planning, we are participating in the Joint Concept for Contested Logistics (JCCL) as part of 
the broader Joint Warfighting Concept (JWC). We also promote capabilities that identify 
solutions to overcome fuels distribution challenges in contested environments, and support the 
development of interoperable, mobile, and survivable operating concepts. These capabilities 
include, but are not limited to, the Joint Petroleum Over the Shore (JPOTS) system of systems 
and the Navy’s Light Amphibious Warship (LAW). The JPOTS system of systems refreshes and 
advances the capability required to transfer bulk fuel from offshore to a land-based termination 
point during future contingency and crisis response operations.  
 
Advanced Energy Storage 
 
Faced with increasing kinetic and non-kinetic threats, the Department is shifting toward more 
distributed, austere, and autonomous operational concepts carried out by platforms and 
installations with escalating power requirements. Advanced energy storage is emerging as a 
critical enabler of these new capabilities. Similar to the Nation as a whole, however, the 
Department lacks a strong domestic supply chain and depends on foreign sources. 
 
As part of this response, the ASD(Sustainment) joined four other inter-agency partners in 
September 2020 to establish the Federal Consortium for Advanced Batteries (FCAB) to 
accelerate the development of a robust secure domestic industrial base for advanced batteries. 
DoD was part of the inter-agency team that developed an inter-agency national strategy for 
lithium batteries designed to guide future investments in the domestic lithium battery 
manufacturing value chain; Department of Energy will release the strategy later this year. The 
Department also is supporting the implementation of Executive Order 14017, America’s Supply 
Chains, and ASD(Sustainment) will continue to provide a single voice regarding advanced 
energy storage requirements for national security applications.  
 
Installation Energy Resilience 
 
At over 500 worldwide military installations, the Department spent $3.5 billion in FY2020 on 
energy to power over 500 installations and 170,000 non-tactical vehicles.  
 
13 
 
Investments in Installation Energy 
 
The FY2022 President’s Budget includes $1.2 billion in investments in installation energy. 
Reflecting a strong track of record and alignment with Administration priorities, the FY2022 
President’s Budget included enhancements totaling over $181 million relative to the previous 
budget request. These enhancements include: 
 
  ERCIP for resilience and conservation: +$104.1 million 
  ERCIP Planning & Design for resilience and conservation: +$15.9 million 
  ERCIP Planning & Design for electric vehicle charging infrastructure: +$10 million 
  Smart Grid pilot initiatives: +$48 million 
  Net Zero Installations: +$3 million 
 
Installation Energy Resilience Policy and Governance 
 
The Department continues to be proactive in developing policy, guidance, and tools to advance 
installation energy and climate resilience.  
 
The Department is coordinating an updated policy with the Military Departments to implement 
energy resilience requirements (10 U.S.C. 2920) that resulted from the Fiscal Year 2021 National 
Defense Authorization Act, and anticipates issuing the guidance this fiscal year. The policy 
memorandum sets forth energy availability standards for critical missions. In addition, it directs 
the military departments to promote the use of multiple and diverse sources of energy in their 
planning, prioritization of energy resources originating on the installation, encourages the use of 
micro grids, and favors the use of full-time, installed energy sources rather than emergency 
generation in their energy resilience solutions.  
 
Black Start Exercises 
 
Black start exercises are a growing component of the Department’s approach to risk assessment. 
In alignment with statute, the Department is conducting full-scale black start exercises to 
evaluate risks to the readiness of our military installations. These exercises have proven 
invaluable in identifying gaps in our installations’ electrical infrastructure, such as previously-
unknown interdependencies between various systems, so that we can best prioritize our 
resilience resources and planning. 
 
Last year, the Department issued the “Framework for Planning and Executing Black Start 
Exercises” that facilitates the planning and execution of future exercises. An “Energy Resilience 
Tabletop Exercise Framework” was also issued to promote continued modeling of black start 
exercises in times of restricted travel and social distancing. In FY2021, the Department has 
executed an additional two exercises at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and Joint Base 
McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. In the remainder of FY2021 and beyond, the Department will execute 
exercises at Eielson AFB, Wright-Patterson AFB and Springfield-Beckley Air National Guard 
Base, Robins AFB, JB Langley-Eustis, Fort Hood, Fort Leavenworth, Rock Island Arsenal, 
Naval Construction Battalion Center Gulfport and more. 
 
 
 
14 
 
Energy Resilience and Conservation Investment Program (ERCIP) 
 
Supported by black start exercises, installation energy plans provide the basis for prioritizing 
resources toward critical gaps. ERCIP is a critical element of DoD’s strategy to improve the 
energy resilience, energy security, and energy conservation of its fixed installations.  
 
The Department increased the budget request for ERCIP to reflect the significance of risks to 
energy systems as well as the need to mitigate the causes of climate change. In FY2022, DoD’s 
combined ERCIP request is $286.75 million for ERCIP, including $243.64 million for 
energy/water resilience projects, $2.96 million for energy/water conservation projects, $30.15 
million for associated planning and design efforts, and $10 million to plan and design EV utility 
infrastructure upgrades.   
 
The FY2022 ERCIP request include two energy resilience projects, including a 10 megawatt 
(MW) Microgrid Project at Fort Bragg and a Landfill Gas (LFG) Power Meter Station at Marine 
Corps Air Station Miramar. Fort Bragg’s ERCIP project consists of a 10 megawatt microgrid to 
increase energy resilience by providing continuous power for critical missions. Even during a 
commercial power outage, this microgrid technology will route continuous power to Joint 
Special Operations Command during contingency operations, increasing reliability of operations 
and mission assurance. Marine Corps Air Station Miramar is developing one of the nation’s 
largest renewable energy microgrids to create a resilient and self-sustaining air station. The 
Landfill Gas Power Meter Station will enhance the microgrid controls as well as it will also 
incorporate and store renewable energy for use. The enhanced MCAS Miramar microgrid will 
result in improved energy resilience during grid outages in support of mission assurance.  
 
For FY2022, the Department is taking a more proactive approach with an ERCIP program 
comprised of a variety of technologies such as renewable and clean energy power generation, 
energy storage systems, industrial control systems, microgrids, and improvements to distribution 
systems to enhance installation energy resilience, security, and control. Just as the Department 
ERCIP Construction request increased, our Planning and Design request increased from $14.25 
million to $40.15 million to support increasingly complex microgrids, renewable and clean 
energy generation, and advanced energy storage. Included in this amount is $10 million 
specifically for planning and design of the charging infrastructure needed to accommodate the 
electrification of DoD’s non-tactical vehicle fleet. 
  
The Energy Resilience Assessment Tool 
 
The Department is enabling the identification of solutions beyond backup generators to meet 
critical energy requirements. To accomplish this, the Department continues to upgrade the 
Energy Resilience Assessment (ERA) Tool for use by the DoD Components. The ERA Tool 
allows users to evaluate and select energy resilience investments that best meet the cost and 
performance requirements of their critical missions. In addition to conducting continuous virtual 
training for installation energy personnel, recent upgrades include improved visualization of 
results and site-specific courses of action. Use of the ERA Tool to validate energy resilience 
enhancements is a requirement for all ERCIP project submissions throughout the Department.  
 
 
 
15 
 
Performance Contracting Authorities 
 
The Department continues to utilize performance contracting (i.e., ESPCs/UESCs) as a 
significant part of its efforts to enhance energy resilience through energy efficiency. Guided by 
the installation energy planning process, DoD will continue to use these contracts where they 
enhance DoD mission readiness, mission assurance, and ultimately DoD’s warfighting 
capability.  
 
For example, through an ESPC at Marine Corps Recruitment Depot (MCRD) Parris Island the 
Marine Corps has enhanced readiness through the installation of a 3.5 megawatt combined heat 
and power plant (CHPP), 6.7 megawatts of solar photovoltaic panels with integrated energy 
storage, and a microgrid control system. Built above the flood zone, the CHPP is less susceptible 
to hurricanes, storms and sea level rise. Based in part to savings from the ESPC, MCRD Parris 
Island decreased its electricity purchased from the commercial grid by more than 50% in FY20 
compared to FY19, which is contributing to greenhouse gas reductions. 
Additionally, Misawa Air Force Base awarded a $206 million-dollar ESPC that includes energy 
conservation and resilience measures such as a smart grid, solar arrays, and a cogeneration power 
plant capable of generating 6.2 MW of power and 83,000 lbs/hour of steam. The new generation 
plant will cut energy waste by an estimated 20% across 679 buildings, generate 70% of the peak 
electrical demand, and reduce 60% of the annual electrical load.  
 
Cyber Resilience 
 
To enable the projection, sustainment, and direct support to forces around the globe, DoD 
installations rely on a range of Facility-Related Control Systems (FRCS) to operate critical 
missions and facilities. FRCS in DoD are subject to a growing range of cyber threats as these 
systems have increasingly become more automated and connected. The attack surface for 
potential adversaries has increased exponentially as result of the integration of network-based 
building management systems, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, as well as the connection of 
legacy control systems into these networks.  
 
As cyber threats continue to expand, the Department has responded by integrating cybersecurity 
into the overall policy and governance for energy resilience. For example, DoD installations now 
include cybersecurity considerations in the development of installation energy plans, and cyber 
secure FRCS are now integral to utility privatization agreements, energy savings performance 
contracts (ESPCs), and utility energy service contracts (UESCs). The Department now requires 
the DoD Components to submit annual FRCS Cybersecurity Plans to capture their efforts to 
collect inventory, complete assessments, implement mitigations, and maintain sustainment for 
FRCS cybersecurity. These complement installation energy plans and are due by the end of June 
2021. The Department has also codified an FRCS Master List and associated security rankings to 
standardize the resourcing, training, education, and budgetary spend around a common definition 
of FRCS. 
 
Energy Innovation 
 
OASD(Sustainment) oversees three Department-wide research, development, test, and 
evaluation programs that support resilient, efficient, and clean energy for use by installations and 
forces.  
16 
 
 
The overall FY2022 budget request for Operational Energy Technology is $97.5 million, 
centered on two key programs: the Operational Energy Capability Improvement (OECI) program 
and the Operational Energy Prototyping (OEP) program. These Defense-wide energy technology 
programs coordinate closely with the Military Services to ensure research, demonstration, test 
and evaluation are focused on the Departments most pressing operational energy needs. For 
OECI, which is focused on advanced technology demonstrations, we request $59.3 million for 
baseline efforts and $15.0 million for nuclear fuel efforts. Our request for OEP, which is focused 
on demonstration of operational energy technology and validation prototyping, is $23.2 million.  
 
To prepare for tomorrow’s energy challenges and combat climate change, OECI/OEP invest in 
three lines of effort. Projects focused on Powering the Force support the deployment of more 
mobile and distributed operations with decreased and more agile logistics, especially through 
contested environments. Efforts in Electrifying the Battlespace enable the electrification of 
weapons, platforms, unmanned systems, and soldiers which drastically reduces fossil fuel 
resupply and enables new capabilities such as silent watch and exportable power. Finally, 
Commanding Energy efforts focus on capturing and understanding platform and weapon system 
energy profiles, including adversarial profiles, to transform the Joint Force from reactive to 
predictive with energy management and control.  
 
The FY2022 budget request for Installation Energy Technology is $39.9 million, implemented 
through the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program’s (ESTCP) Installation 
Energy and Water Program Area (EW). The ESTCP EW Program Area focuses on improving 
the resilience of DoD’s energy and water systems and reducing carbon emissions from buildings 
and non-tactical vehicles. To achieve these outcomes, the Program identifies, demonstrates, and 
transitions innovative technologies that increase the energy and water efficiency of DoD 
buildings, improve the security and reliability of energy and water supply, reduce the life-cycle 
cost of DoD facilities, and reduce carbon emissions from on-site fuel consumption.   
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to present the President’s FY2022 budget request for DoD 
programs supporting energy, installations, and environment. We appreciate Congress’ continued 
support for our enterprise and look forward to working with you as you consider the budget 
request.

STATEMENT OF DEB HAALAND 
SECRETARY 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR 
BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON  
INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES 
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
U.S. SENATE 
 
JUNE 16, 2021 
 
Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski and Members of the Subcommittee, 
thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of the Interior Department’s Fiscal 
Year 2022 Budget Proposal.  
It is an honor and privilege for me to be here with you today to represent the 
Department and our tens of thousands of dedicated professionals. It is also deeply 
meaningful for me, as the first Native American Cabinet Secretary, to speak to you 
from the ancestral homelands of the Anacostan and Piscataway people.  
I honor Interior’s long tradition of working closely and collaboratively with this 
Subcommittee and I respect the important role you play in the success of the 
Department and our programs. Working together, we can accomplish great things on 
behalf the American people.    
Interior’s 2022 budget request totals $17.6 billion, of which $16.0 billion is within the 
jurisdiction of this Subcommittee. Our 2022 budget request is a $2.5 billion or a 17 
percent increase from the 2021 enacted appropriation. This budget will help 
implement the President’s ambitious vision to lift up the Nation in this unprecedented 
time by addressing the climate crisis, providing much-needed resources to Tribal 
nations, restoring balance on public lands and waters, advancing environmental 
justice, and investing in a clean energy future.  
1 
 
Interior’s wide-ranging programs create economic opportunities and jobs for the 
American people. As reflected in the Department’s Economic Contributions Report 
for Fiscal Year 2019, Interior’s mission activities supported an estimated 1.9 million 
jobs and $336 billion in economic output. Interior has an important and unique 
mission to uphold and honor the Nation’s trust responsibilities and commitments to 
Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and affiliated island communities to help them 
prosper.  
The 2022 budget lays out the important role Interior will play to accomplish the 
Administration’s goals to move our country forward. This request includes the 
President’s American Jobs Plan, which provides a longer-term strategy to create 
millions of good-paying union jobs, rebuild our country’s infrastructure, and position 
America to out-compete others on the global stage.  
Interior plays an important role in the President’s plan to reinvest in the foundations 
of the Nation’s strength. The 2022 budget addresses the need to invest in America at 
this critical time, when the Nation faces challenges from a pandemic, an economic 
downturn, climate change, and a reckoning with racial injustice. As such, Interior’s 
2022 budget invests in America’s future. Programs focus on adaptive management 
and increasing resilience to the changing climate; creating jobs and economic 
development; using science to inform; strengthening Tribal nations’ self-
determination; expanding inclusion of historically underrepresented communities; 
promoting environmental justice; delivering Interior’s core services; and providing 
effective stewardship of America’s national treasures.  
A key component of the Administration’s investment strategy to address climate 
impacts on the ground through land stewardship and conservation is leveraging the 
power of Americans across the country. The Administration recently released a 
preliminary report to the National Climate Task Force—Conserving and Restoring 
America the Beautiful—recommending a 10-year, locally led campaign to conserve 
and restore America’s lands and waters. The report provides an overarching 
framework to implement the President’s goal to conserve 30 percent of U.S. land and 
2 
 
waters by 2030, which will help address the climate crisis and its impacts on nature, 
improve equitable access to the outdoors, and strengthen the economy. The report 
recognizes and celebrates the voluntary conservation efforts of farmers, ranchers, and 
forest owners; the leadership of sovereign Tribal nations in caring for lands, waters, 
and wildlife; the contributions and stewardship traditions of America’s hunters, 
anglers, and fishing communities; and the vital importance of investing in 
playgrounds, trails, and open space in park-deprived communities.  
The America the Beautiful initiative is intended to serve as a call to action to support 
locally led conservation and restoration efforts across public, private, State, and Tribal 
lands and waters. The initiative welcomes all communities wishing to steward their 
lands and waters, boost the economy, and support jobs. Supporting these principles, 
the 2022 budget includes increases across Interior to support local partnership 
programs.  
Consistent with Congressional direction, the 2022 President’s budget allocates 
mandatory funding available through the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA). 
That funding includes up to $1.6 billion for deferred maintenance projects in the 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National 
Park Service (NPS), and the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE).  
Thanks to broad bipartisan support of GAOA in 2020, $900.0 million in mandatory 
LWCF resources is made available annually for conservation and recreation activities 
managed by Interior and the U.S. Forest Service. In 2021, Interior is providing $420.8 
million, which includes $19.0 million from discretionary funds, to States and other 
partners for local conservation and recreation programs through non-Federal grants 
and $280.7 million for Federal programs, including voluntary land acquisition and 
easement programs in the BLM, FWS, and NPS. In May 2021, Interior awarded 
$150.0 million to local communities through the Outdoor Recreation Legacy 
Partnership grant program. Funded through the LWCF, this competitive program 
enables urban communities to create and reinvigorate outdoor recreation spaces and 
connect people and the outdoors in economically underserved communities. The 
3 
 
LWCF programs directly support land and resource conservation and increase access 
to outdoor recreation across America.  
In the 2022 budget, Interior proposes to allocate $700.9 million for LWCF programs, 
which includes $19.0 million from discretionary funds. The 2022 budget estimates an 
additional $128.3 million will be available for State LWCF grants as a result of 
revenue derived from certain offshore oil and gas sales in the Gulf of Mexico.  
The 2022 budget proposal includes new investments for climate-related investments 
to conserve and adaptively manage natural resources, increase understanding of how 
natural resources are changing and what that means, build resilience to protect 
communities and lands from significant impacts, and contribute to the reduction of 
greenhouse gases. The budget proposal also contains funding for wildland fire 
management, drought mitigation, and science-based investments that will help the 
Department and communities prepare for and address the aftermath of natural hazard 
events. These efforts will be supported by investments for science-driven 
conservation to align management of the Nation’s natural resources with America’s 
climate, biodiversity, and clean energy needs.  
To address the growing threat of wildfire to public health and community safety, the 
FY 2022 request includes a robust increase of $117.8 million in Interior’s wildland 
fire programs.  This features an increase of $107.4 million for hazardous fuels and 
burned area rehabilitation programs. This funding will support efforts to manage 
vegetation and reduce the intensity, severity, and negative effects of wildfire, in line 
with the Administration’s science-based approach to risk management and 
complementing our other efforts to improve land health and resilience to climate 
change and reduce carbon emissions. As we head into what is already a challenging 
wildland fire season due to historic levels of drought in the West, these important 
investments in risk reduction continue to be top of mind.    
The 2022 budget proposes to rebuild core functions and capacities within Interior that 
have been diminished in recent years with investments in USGS science and staffing, 
4 
 
and the core operations of parks, wildlife refuges and public lands. The investments in 
Interior’s budget request also provide a key opportunity for the Administration and 
Congress to work together to restore levels of investment in programs at the 
Department and across government, and to lay a foundation for core programs that 
improve the life of everyday Americans.   
To implement the American Jobs Plan, the 2022 budget includes new investments to 
create good-paying jobs with a free and fair chance to join a union, rebuild the 
country’s infrastructure, address the climate crisis, and position the United States to 
out-compete other countries. The proposal includes an increase of $300.0 million to 
support efforts to plug orphan oil and gas wells, clean up abandoned mines, and 
decommission offshore oil and gas infrastructure, which will help create jobs and 
improve the environmental quality of energy communities by addressing serious 
safety hazards and risks from associated air, water, or other environmental damage. 
As part of this proposal, the budget includes $169.2 million for a new Energy 
Community Revitalization Program (ERCP), which will help accelerate this 
remediation and reclamation work on Interior-managed lands and support work on 
non-Federal lands through grants to States and Tribes. The new ECRP will include 
$75.0 million to address reclamation and restoration within Interior and also provide 
$70.0 million for assistance and support to States and $20.0 million for reclamation 
on Tribal lands. The program will provide technical assistance and funding to 
inventory abandoned mines and oil and gas wells and to support reclamation projects.  
As part of a White House forum with Federal agencies, States, industry, and labor in 
March 2021, the Administration announced a commitment by the Departments of the 
Interior, Energy, and Commerce to increase renewable energy development on 
Federal waters and set a target to deploy 30 gigawatts (30,000 megawatts) of offshore 
wind by 2030, creating nearly 80,000 jobs. Work is already underway to meet this 
ambitious goal. In the first months of the Administration, the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
Management (BOEM) approved the first major offshore wind project in U.S. waters, 
the 800 MW Vineyard Wind project, which will create 3,600 jobs and generate 
enough power for 400,000 homes and businesses. BOEM also issued a lease for the 
5 
 
first wave energy research project in Federal waters off the U.S. West coast, identified 
a new Wind Energy Area in the New York Bight, and announced intent for 
environmental reviews for projects offshore New Jersey, Rhode Island, and 
Massachusetts. The budget includes $249.1 million in funding to increase renewable 
energy production on public lands and in offshore waters, which will create jobs and 
help transition the county to a clean energy future. The funding primarily supports 
infrastructure permitting for onshore and offshore renewable energy projects such as 
solar, wind, wave and geothermal. 
In anticipation of large-scale development of offshore wind energy on the Outer 
Continental Shelf (OCS), the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement 
(BSEE) is preparing to take on new responsibilities with respect to renewable energy 
workplace and process safety management, environmental protection, and 
decommissioning and site restoration. BSEE is also assuming safety and 
environmental enforcement operational functions for Federal OCS offshore renewable 
energy development. In 2022, the BSEE budget includes $9.8 million, an increase of 
$9.0 million, to establish a core foundational program to support the development of a 
safe, robust, and environmentally responsible offshore wind industry in the United 
States. The funding will enable timely and rigorous industry plan reviews, initiate a 
robust compliance assurance program, promote science-based renewable energy 
research, and demonstrate BSEE’s commitment and leadership in driving safety 
performance in the offshore wind industry. 
In May 2021, BLM announced final approval of the Crimson Solar Project on BLM 
lands in Riverside County, CA. The project has the potential to deliver enough energy 
to power roughly 87,500 homes. The project is located within one of the areas 
designated for development in the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan, 
identified through a process of extensive review and coordination. The budget 
includes $55.6 million, an increase of $25.0 million, for onshore clean energy 
programs managed by BLM. This amount includes $44.6 million in the Renewable 
Energy program, an increase of $14.0 million from the 2021 enacted level, and a 
program increase of $11.0 million in the Resource Management Planning program to 
6 
 
support renewable energy project siting. This funding will support the permitting and 
rights-of-way work associated with siting new projects and transmission lines. To 
ramp up to meet the Administration’s renewable energy goals, BLM is reviewing 
policies and resources, working with other agencies to improve coordination, and 
reviewing current applications that could be expedited.  
The 2022 budget includes an additional $13.0 million in FWS to accommodate 
increased permitting reviews associated with clean energy. The 2022 budget also 
includes an increase of $7.0 million to support clean energy programs and grid 
infrastructure in the Insular Areas. In the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), program 
funding for clean energy deployment programs in Indian Country totals $66.0 million, 
an increase of $50.0 million from the 2021 enacted level. 
President Biden has challenged Federal agencies to leverage the purchasing power of 
Federal procurements to spur the deployment of clean energy technologies and 
supporting infrastructure and the jobs they create. Interior’s fleet includes 
approximately 30,800 vehicles. The 2022 budget includes $73.0 million to start 
transitioning Interior’s fleet to zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) as part of a 
governmentwide initiative. Funding will support either acquiring ZEVs within the 
owned fleet or transitioning to the General Services Administration’s leased fleet, 
investment in the related charging infrastructure, and planning and integration to 
effectively support the initiative. 
To address abandoned coal mine cleanup, the 2022 budget includes $165.0 million, 
an increase of $50.0 million, for the Abandoned Mine Land and Economic 
Revitalization (AMLER) program in the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and 
Enforcement. The program provides grants to the six Appalachian States with the 
highest amount of unfunded Priority 1 and Priority 2 Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) 
sites and the three Tribes with AML programs. Grants are awarded for projects that 
accelerate the remediation of AML sites and encourage economic and community 
development. 
7 
 
Science is valued at Interior, and it guides management decisions. Science is a 
cornerstone of the 2022 budget, with strong investments in science across the 
Department to better support bureau missions, address climate change on the ground, 
and invest in tools to monitor, measure, and model solutions to important resource 
challenges. The 2022 budget includes $1.3 billion for research and development 
programs, and these investments in mission-specific science provide a new approach 
to developing and delivering actionable products and reducing barriers between 
science production and user application.  
USGS is Interior’s primary science organization, with a broad portfolio related to the 
earth and biological sciences. The 2022 budget includes $1.6 billion for USGS, an 
increase of $326.9 million from the 2021 enacted level. The budget for USGS 
includes an increase of $205.0 million, to make science the centerpiece of the Biden 
Administration’s commitment to tackling the climate change crisis, and another $83.0 
million increase in other research and development, including support for 
conservation programs, such as the America the Beautiful initiative. The 2022 
investments in USGS science span the range of climate adaptation and land change 
science, carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas monitoring, critical minerals, mine 
waste reclamation and reuse, hazards monitoring, and water prediction.  
The 2022 USGS budget accelerates the development of tools supporting planning, 
monitoring, and projection, including the Protected Areas Database of the United 
States (PAD-US) and the Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection 
(LCMAP) initiative. These two tools provide solutions to the growing need for 
conservation planning and information about the fundamental drivers of land change 
and the consequences of human-caused and natural changes. Collectively, these 
investments will accelerate discoveries with the potential to transform America’s 
understanding of the natural world, launch the next generation of Landsat to study and 
improve life on Earth, and enable U.S. independence from adversarial nations for 
industrial materials needed for current technologies. 
8 
 
The 2022 budget includes $60.0 million in USGS collaborative research with the new 
Advanced Research Projects Agency for Climate (ARPA-C) within the Department 
of Energy. This high-risk, accelerated research can achieve transformational 
advancement in climate adaptation and resilience in areas in which industry by itself 
is not likely to invest due to technical and financial uncertainty. The investment will 
focus on work in five areas critically important to Interior’s mission and to tackling 
the climate crisis: planning tools to support habitat health and biodiversity, models for 
drought prediction, predictive tools for wildfire and post-wildfire risk management, 
coastal change and vulnerability forecasts for planning and disaster response and 
recovery, and models to assess the potential and risks for geologic storage of 
hydrogen created using renewable energy. 
The Civilian Climate Corps (CCC) is an important jobs initiative that draws on 
America’s strength to work together and build back better to revitalize public lands, 
infrastructure, and communities—and, in doing so, create jobs. The idea builds from 
the Civilian Conservation Corps, which put hundreds of thousands of young people to 
work on public and private lands, providing them with jobs and training to tackle the 
crises of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. The President calls for a broad 
CCC initiative in the American Jobs Plan, which stretches across Federal agencies 
and non-Federal partners throughout the country. Complementing this broader effort, 
Interior’s discretionary 2022 budget includes $85.5 million for CCC work on 
Interior’s lands. In 2022, the CCC program will build upon existing programs and 
partnerships that share the same objectives—to tackle climate change on the ground, 
provide a living wage, provide skills and a pathway to employment, and reflect the 
diversity of America.  
The Biden-Harris Administration made its commitment to Tribal nations clear from 
the start, emphasizing the need to strengthen and respect the government-to-
government relationship with Tribes. Underscoring that focus on Indian Country, the 
2022 budget proposal includes $4.2 billion, an increase of $727.8 million from the 
2021 enacted level, across all Indian Affairs programs. The budget invests in core 
Indian Affairs programs and addresses outstanding gaps in areas such as 
9 
 
environmental quality and ensuring Tribal communities are part of the national 
priorities to address climate change and move toward clean energy.  
The 2022 budget includes $2.7 billion for BIA programs, an increase of $614.9 
million from the 2021 enacted level. The budget includes $346.5 million to fully fund 
estimated Contract Support Costs, an increase of $61.0 million from the 2021 enacted 
level, and $36.6 million for Payments for Tribal Leases, $15.0 million above the 2021 
enacted level. The budget proposes to reclassify discretionary funding for Contract 
Support Costs and Payments for Tribal Leases to mandatory funding starting in 2023. 
Doing so will provide Tribal nations with certainty that these commitments will be 
met with a dedicated, predictable funding source. 
The BIA request also includes $150.0 million for a new Indian Land Consolidation 
Program (ILCP) to enhance the ability of Tribal governments to plan for and adapt to 
climate change and to build stronger Tribal communities. Reducing land fractionation 
and achieving Tribal majority ownership in lands enables Tribes to make decisions 
about land management, use, and protection that facilitate climate resilience. The new 
program reflects the ongoing need to continue to address fractionation on Indian lands 
as the Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations (LBBP), established as part of the 
Cobell Settlement, ends in November 2022.  The program estimates that by the time 
the LBBP program concludes, 60 percent of the unique locations within fractionated 
land will not have been visited by the program. Without further efforts, the program 
expects the number of fractional interests will likely return to pre-program levels 
within approximately 20 years.  
The 2022 budget includes $395.8 million for BIA Trust Natural Resources 
Management programs, an increase of $136.9 million from the 2021 enacted level. 
The budget increases funding across the full spectrum of Tribal natural resource 
programs, recognizing their economic importance as well as their contributions to 
environmental quality and conservation. Within Trust Natural Resources, the budget 
includes $61.0 million for the Tribal Climate Resilience program, an increase of 
$44.0 million from the 2021 enacted level. The increase includes $23.0 million to 
10 
 
expand Tribal Climate Adaptation Grants, $11.0 million in additional funding for 
Alaska Village Relocation Grants, and $10.0 million for a Tribal CCC. The budget 
includes $56.2 million for Minerals and Mining projects, which focus on clean and 
alternative energy programs, an increase of $40.1 million from the 2021 enacted 
level.  
BIA’s 2022 budget includes $507.1 million for Public Safety services, an increase of 
$38.5 million. This increase includes $10.0 million to support the McGirt v. 
Oklahoma Supreme Court decision, $10.0 million to support a body-worn camera 
initiative for officers, $8.2 million to continue support for BIA participation in the 
Federal Opioid Initiative, and $5.0 million for implementation of the Violence 
Against Women Act. The budget includes $116.4 million, an increase of $10.0 
million, for detention and correction programs and $43.2 million, an increase of $4.2 
million, for Tribal courts. 
The 2022 BIA budget includes a $14.1 million increase to support Human Services 
activities, including $3.0 million to expand the Tiwahe Initiative. The Tiwahe 
Initiative is a holistic approach to addressing overall Tribal community needs that 
support youth, family, community safety and stability, and cultural awareness. The 
initiative facilitates collaboration within Tribal communities—which can help to 
leverage resources, share expertise, reduce duplication, and exchange information 
about families’ needs—to formulate the most responsive approach to provide service. 
The 2022 BIA budget maintains strong support for the Missing and Murdered 
Indigenous American Indians and Alaska Natives initiative, including $16.5 million 
for the program, an increase of $5.0 million from the 2021 enacted level. The 2022 
budget also includes specific investments to address environmental quality problems 
on Tribal lands. Within BIA Construction, the budget includes $29.9 million 
specifically to address water safety and sanitation requirements related to BIA-owned 
drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.  
11 
 
The 2022 budget includes $270.2 million for Indian water rights settlement activities, 
an increase of $71.9 million from the 2021 enacted level. This amount includes $75.2 
million within BIA, an increase of $30.2 million from the 2021 enacted level, and 
$157.6 million within the Bureau of Reclamation, an increase of $36.8 million, for 
settlements. The budget proposes to reclassify discretionary funding for enacted 
Indian water settlements, including these two new settlements, to mandatory funding 
starting in 2023. Doing so will provide Tribal nations with certainty that these 
commitments will be met with a dedicated, predictable funding source. 
The 2022 budget includes $1.3 billion for Indian Education programs, an increase of 
$110.6 million from the 2021 enacted level. The primary focus of funding remains on 
support for the day-to-day operations of BIE-funded elementary and secondary 
schools. Funds will enable BIE to improve opportunities and outcomes in the 
classroom, provide improved instructional services, and support improved teacher 
quality, recruitment, and retention. The budget requests $24.7 million for Early Child 
and Family Development, an increase of $3.7 million, to expand preschool 
opportunities at BIE-funded schools. The budget also invests in postsecondary 
programs, including $45.0 million for Tribal scholarships and adult education, an 
increase of $10.2 million from the 2021 enacted level, and includes $5.0 million for 
the Science Post Graduate Scholarship Fund, an increase of $2.0 million, for a new 
initiative providing research internships to highly qualified students from 
economically disadvantaged rural communities. 
The BIE is working collaboratively with Tribes and communities to alleviate the 
strains imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic on BIE students and their families, as 
well as on teachers, administrators, and staff across BIE’s schools and the Tribal 
Colleges and Universities. The 2022 budget includes funding to maintain the 
important investments in distance learning infrastructure provided during the 
pandemic. The budget includes $35.4 million for Education Information Technology, 
which is an increase of $20.1 million from the 2021 enacted level. This increase 
provides critical funding to support upgraded broadband access at BIE schools, 
including recurring operating costs for network systems, such as annual learning 
12 
 
software subscriptions and licenses. These investments will enable BIE to continue 
delivering education during the pandemic as well as substantially improve the 
efficiency and quality of education upon return to in-school learning. 
To support infrastructure needs, the 2022 budget also includes $264.3 million in 
discretionary education construction funds to replace and repair school facilities and 
address priority maintenance needs at 183 schools. The budget continues to invest in 
activities that promote educational self-determination for Tribal communities and 
includes $94.9 million, an increase of $8.0 million, for Tribal Grant Support Costs to 
cover the administration costs for Tribes that choose to operate BIE-funded schools. 
This level of funding supports 100 percent of the estimated requirement.  
President Biden’s EO 13985 on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for 
Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government clearly states the 
Administration’s policy: “The Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive 
approach to advancing equity for all” to include those who have been historically 
underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and 
inequality. The President’s call to agencies to advance equity for all is being put into 
action at Interior.  
The Department is taking stock of current programs across Interior that address equal 
employment opportunity, civil rights, diversity and inclusion, accessibility, workplace 
culture transformation, and discrimination based on gender identity or sexual 
orientation. As part of this process, the Department is working with bureaus and 
offices to identify gaps, challenges, and best practices and to examine Department and 
bureau roles, responsibilities, and governance to ensure that any necessary changes 
are implemented. The 2022 budget includes a $12.8 million increase across Interior 
bureaus and offices to better address diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in 
Interior’s workforce. 
The Administration’s emphasis on equity for all and inclusion is also a part of how 
Interior executes its core missions. As part of the NEPA process, bureaus and offices 
13 
 
must consider the impacts on the natural or physical environment as well as social, 
cultural, and economic impacts. The Department is committed to ensuring the Federal 
Government honors the government-to-government relationship with Tribes and 
strengthens Tribal sovereignty through meaningful Tribal consultation.  
The FY 2022 budget request promotes racial justice and equity in underserved 
communities by embedding environmental justice and racial equity goals into 
programs across the Department, with discrete investments in key areas. The NPS 
plays a particularly important role in ensuring cultural diversity in Federal programs 
and connecting underserved communities to the Department. The NPS is also charged 
with preserving and caring for structures and artifacts that tell the story of all 
Americans. Providing outdoor recreation opportunities, the telling of America’s story, 
and preservation of our collective history are an essential element of Interior’s 
mission. The NPS 2022 budget includes $15.0 million to expand capacity at more 
than 16 national park units and programs that preserve and tell the story of historically 
underrepresented and marginalized groups, including $5.0 million for the African 
American Civil Rights Network. The budget includes an additional $5.0 million for 
competitive historic preservation grants to increase support to State and local efforts 
to preserve sites that document the struggle for equal opportunity for African 
Americans. The budget includes $10.0 million for construction at the Selma 
Interpretive Center for a voting rights center that honors the legacy of civil rights 
leaders, including the late Representative John Lewis. 
The 2022 budget expands ongoing programs working to connect new audiences to the 
outdoors and Interior’s mission activities. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service budget 
includes $12.5 million for its Urban Wildlife Conservation Program, an increase of 
$7.0 million from the 2021 enacted level. The program features 101 national wildlife 
refuges that are within a 25-mile radius of an urban area, such as Bayou Savage 
National Wildlife Refuge near New Orleans. With 80 percent of Americans living in 
cities, the program is helping people to get outside, engage with their community, and 
become part of the next generation of outdoor enthusiasts. 
14 
 
EO 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, establishes the Justice40 
Initiative that will seek to bring 40 percent of the overall benefits of relevant Federal 
investments to underserved communities. The initiative will focus on clean energy 
and energy efficiency, clean transit, affordable and sustainable housing, training and 
workforce development, the reduction of legacy pollution, and the development of 
critical clean water infrastructure. Interior programs will play a strong role in this 
initiative to address racial equity and environmental justice through inclusive 
initiatives, such as Reclamation Jobs and Clean Energy for Tribal Communities, as 
well as core mission activities to construct drinking water and irrigation systems in 
underserved communities, encourage open areas and recreation in cities through 
urban refuges and parks, and increase access to broadband and power in the hard-to-
reach parts of America.  
The 2022 budget includes important investments in programs needed to help build 
back America to be better and more competitive as the world continues to change. 
This includes funding to support a strong, talented workforce at Interior and 
strengthen the core infrastructure needed to continue to deliver Interior’s missions. 
Staffing declined during the past 4 years by 4,382, or 6.7 percent, from 2017 through 
2020. Current staffing is expected to increase so that by the end of 2021, Interior 
staffing levels will be roughly where they were at the end of 2018. With the 2022 
budget, staffing is estimated to surpass 2017 staffing levels by 3.2 percent. As the 
Department works to rebuild its workforce, Interior will seek to recruit, hire, and train 
the next generation of talent that reflects the diversity and strength of the United 
States. Complementing our diverse workforce, the Department is committed to 
providing the tools critical for success across Interior. 
Interior manages an infrastructure portfolio valued at more than $330 billion, ranging 
from large dams and canals in the West to iconic national landmarks across the 
country. In total, the Department is responsible for roughly 43,000 buildings, 100,000 
miles of road, and 80,000 structures. Operations, maintenance, recapitalization, and 
modernization of Interior’s infrastructure are a significant part of annual cost 
requirements. The 2022 budget includes $2.8 billion for operations, maintenance, 
15 
 
repair, and construction of Interior facilities, an increase of $241.8 million from the 
2021 enacted level. This amount includes maintenance and construction across the 
Department, including water project construction, maintenance, and dam safety.  
Much of Interior’s workforce worked remotely during the pandemic, and bureaus and 
offices worked quickly to adapt and ensure that staff had the right equipment and 
bandwidth to telework effectively. These efforts increased demand on the 
Department’s networks and heightened attention to the importance of a strong 
cybersecurity posture at Interior. The 2022 budget includes an increase of $25.5 
million to support the post-SolarWinds Department-wide cyber defense capability and 
address related gaps identified in specific bureaus.  
Interior’s central Financial and Business Management System (FBMS) requires 
modernization, and the budget requests an increase of $5.0 million for the first year of 
a 2-year system infrastructure migration to prevent technical obsolescence. FBMS 
supports the administrative systems requirements of all Interior bureaus for core 
accounting, budget execution, acquisition, aspects of financial assistance, real and 
personal property management, fleet management, travel integration, enterprise 
information management, and reporting. The migration will modernize and transform 
Interior’s administrative operations, strengthen the cybersecurity of Federal networks 
and critical infrastructure, and implement security measures. As part of the 
modernization of FBMS, the 2022 budget includes an increase of $4.0 million to 
support migration to improved cloud hosting with sufficient virtual in-memory 
servers needed to support the size and complexity of the Departmentwide FBMS 
system. 
The 2022 budget includes a $17.5 million increase to begin the next phase of the 
Office of Natural Resource Revenue’s (ONRR’s) ongoing IT Modernization effort of 
the Minerals Revenue Management Support System. The modernization is focused on 
the design, development, and deployment of the new systems and the eventual 
decommissioning of the legacy system. ONRR ensures that revenue from Federal and 
Indian mineral leases is effectively, efficiently, and accurately collected, accounted 
16 
 
for, analyzed, audited, and disbursed in a timely fashion to recipients. Revenue 
distributions, which totaled $8.1 billion in 2020, benefit States, Tribes, individual 
Indian mineral royalty owners, and U.S. Treasury accounts. The modernization will 
improve the timeliness and accuracy of payments to fund recipients by reducing the 
need for manual processes.  
The President believes we must use every lever at our disposal to meet the moment 
and make necessary progress. I firmly believe we have the opportunity of a lifetime to 
strengthen our country, protect our environment, and improve our way of life for 
generations to come.    
I look forward to working with you to achieve these goals.  Thank you again for 
having me. I am pleased to answer any questions you may have.

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 
 
Statement by Miguel Cardona 
Secretary of Education 
on the 
U.S. Department of Education Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request 
 
Good morning Chairwoman Murray and Ranking Member Blunt. 
I am pleased to join you today, and I am proud to testify on behalf of President Biden’s 
fiscal year 2022 Budget Request for the Department of Education. The full fiscal year 2022 
Budget Request, which was released a little over two weeks ago, makes good on President 
Biden’s campaign commitment to reverse years of underinvestment in Federal education 
programs and would begin to address the significant inequities that millions of students—
primarily students of color—and teachers confront every day in underserved schools across 
America. These inequities in opportunity and access continue to be experienced by students 
pursuing higher education and career and technical education credentials as well. 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT 
Before I begin, I want to thank the Members of the Subcommittee—and your staff—who 
helped carry the American Rescue Plan Act to the finish line.  I can tell you from immediate 
experience that the ARP funds will make all the difference in ensuring that schools re-open for 
full-time, in-person instruction as safely and soon as possible.  In addition, ARP funds will 
enable schools to address the mental health, social, and emotional needs of students that the 
pandemic has laid bare, and to fully recover from the massive impact of lost instructional time on 
student achievement during the pandemic. 
The plans to reopen are bold – and will require coordination among key stakeholders at 
the Federal, State, and local levels. But they match the urgency the challenges before us demand. 
It’s important to remember that once we fully reopen schools, we still have work to do. Our job 
will not be done. Generations of inequity have left far too many students without equitable 
 
2 
 
access to high-quality, inclusive learning opportunities. Education can be the great equalizer – it 
was for me – if we prioritize, replicate, and invest in what works for all students, not just some. 
We must do more to level the playing field, including providing a strong foundation from 
birth, improving diversity among the teacher workforce, and creating learning pathways that 
work for all students. To that end, the fiscal year 2022 budget proposal for the Department of 
Education provides strong investments in key areas to ensure students of all ages have what they 
need to succeed. 
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FUNDING LEVELS 
The President’s fiscal year 2022 request calls for a significant and long-overdue increase 
in Federal support for education from birth through college and career.  The proposed 
discretionary request of $103 billion for Department of Education programs, an increase of 
almost $30 billion over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level, would be complemented by additional 
mandatory investments under the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan.  We 
understand that some have raised questions about the unprecedented increase in Federal 
education funding proposed by President Biden, particularly coming on top of emergency 
appropriations over the past year to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our 
schools.  However, it’s important to recognize that these bold proposals follow a decade of 
virtually no funding growth in real terms for Department programs, a significant under-
investment in light of the rising needs of students and families. 
The $73.5 billion that Congress appropriated for the Department for the current fiscal 
year, fiscal year 2021, is about 8 percent more than the fiscal year 2011 total of $68.3 billion.  
Title I funding did a little better, up 10 percent, or 1 percent a year, over the same period of time.  
The total Federal investment in elementary and secondary education grew at the same rate—just 
1 percent annually over the past 10 years—not even keeping up with inflation.

FUNDING INEQUITIES IN STATE AND LOCAL EDUCATION SYSTEMS 
This underinvestment in K-12 education matters because of the dramatic and 
longstanding inequities in State and local education funding systems, which despite more than 
half a century of litigation and reform, too often continue to provide significantly less funding for 
high-poverty districts and schools, which are more likely to serve students of color, resulting in a 
disproportionate impact on these students.  Reversing these funding inequities, as well as 
immediately addressing the negative impact of those inequities in service of students, are critical 
goals of the Biden-Harris Administration’s racial equity agenda, and the President’s fiscal year 
2022 request for the Department of Education would make a meaningful down payment toward 
these goals. Addressing these inequities are critical to our nation’s future. Our country and our 
economy will be stronger when every child is prepared to succeed in tomorrow’s economy, 
regardless of race, zip code, their family’s income, or disability. 
INVESTMENT IN TITLE I GRANTS TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES 
The centerpiece of that request is $20 billion for a new Title I Equity Grants program—
part of the President’s commitment to dramatically increase funding for Title I schools—that 
would help address long-standing funding disparities between under-resourced school districts 
and their wealthier counterparts; ensure teachers in Title I schools are paid competitively; 
support expanded access to preschool; and increase preparation for, access to, and success in the 
rigorous coursework needed to prepare for postsecondary education and high-paying, in-demand 
careers.  This proposal will further the goals of Title I as outlined by President Johnson in 
partnership with Congress back in 1965 as part of the War on Poverty, to help ensure that all 
students—especially students from low-income backgrounds and students of color in 
underserved communities—receive the high-quality education they need to thrive and achieve 
their dreams.

INVESTMENT IN IMPROVING STUDENTS’ PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH 
Long before the COVID-19 pandemic there was increasing evidence that the conditions 
of poverty—especially concentrated poverty—take a tragic toll on the physical and mental health 
of students. This warrants significant investments in mitigating the impact of this toll in order to 
improve student outcomes.  Congress recognized this problem, in part, through the creation and 
rapid increase in funding for the Title IV-A Student Support and Academic Enrichment program.  
Our request would build on these efforts through a $1 billion investment for a new School-Based 
Health Professionals program to support the mental health needs of our students by increasing 
the number of counselors, nurses, and mental health professionals in our schools, and building 
the pipeline for these critical staff, with an emphasis on underserved schools. 
COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS 
In addition, the President’s request would help increase the availability of a broad range 
of wrap-around services to students and families in underserved schools and communities 
through a significant expansion of the Full-Service Community Schools program, from 
$30 million in fiscal year 2021 to $443 million in fiscal year 2022.  This program recognizes the 
role of schools as the centers of our communities and neighborhoods, and funds efforts to 
identify and integrate the wide range of community-based resources needed to support students 
and their families, expand learning opportunities for students and parents alike, support 
collaborative leadership and practices, and promote the family and community engagement that 
can help ensure student success.  The request would support implementation of the community 
schools model at roughly 800 additional schools serving up to 2.4 million students, family 
members, and community members. 
Our request also would help strengthen communities by fostering diverse schools through 
renewed efforts to improve school racial and socioeconomic diversity.  We would provide $100 
million for a new Fostering Diverse Schools program that would help communities develop and 
 
5 
 
implement strategies that will build more racially and socioeconomically diverse schools.  
Research suggests that diverse learning environments benefit all students and can improve 
student achievement, serve as engines of social and economic mobility, and promote school 
improvement.  Our proposal also would build evidence around effective practices for addressing 
the growing concern that our Nation’s schools are becoming less diverse and more segregated 
each year. 
SUPPORT FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION 
We also think it is past time for the Federal Government to make good on its commitment 
to students with disabilities and their families, as expressed in the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act.  The President’s request makes a significant move toward full funding of the 
IDEA with a $2.6 billion, or 20 percent, increase for IDEA Part B Grants to States above the 
regular fiscal year 2021 appropriation, for a total of $15.5 billion.  Notably, this increase would 
raise the Federal share of the excess cost of serving students with disabilities for the first time in 
8 years—demonstrating that IDEA has been yet another casualty of the Federal underinvestment 
in education over the past 10 years. 
In addition, we would increase funding for the IDEA Part C Grants for the Infants and 
Families program by more than 50 percent, or $250 million above the regular fiscal year 2021 
appropriation level, for a total of $732 million to expand access to early intervention services for 
infants and toddlers with disabilities.  We would pair this increased funding with reforms to 
strengthen the Part C program, particularly for children who have been historically 
underrepresented in the program, including children of color. 
The President’s Request would also boost the Preschool Grants program by $105 million 
over the 2021 appropriation, to aid in the provision of special education and related services for 
children with disabilities aged 3 through 5.   
 
 
6 
 
TEACHER TRAINING AND SUPPORT 
The Title I Equity Grants proposal is just one demonstration of President Biden’s strong 
commitment to teachers.  Other key investments, split between discretionary and mandatory 
American Families Plan funding, include $412 million ($132 million in discretionary funding 
and an additional $280 in mandatory authority for fiscal year 2022) for Teacher Quality 
Partnerships to address teaching shortages, improve training and supports for teachers, and boost 
teacher diversity, particularly through investment in teacher residencies and Grow Your Own 
programs; $340 million ($250 million in discretionary funding and an additional $90 million in 
mandatory authority for fiscal year 2022) for Special Education Personnel Preparation to ensure 
that there are adequate numbers of personnel with the skills and knowledge necessary to help 
children with disabilities succeed educationally; and $60 million ($20 million in discretionary 
funding and an additional $40 in mandatory authority for fiscal year 2022) to fund for the first 
time the Hawkins Centers of Excellence program designed to increase the quality and number of 
new teachers of color.  In addition, the American Families Plan would make a one-time 
mandatory investment of $1.6 billion to support additional certifications at no cost for more than 
100,000 educators in high-demand areas like special education, bilingual education, career and 
technical education, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  We are also 
requesting, through the American Families Plan, $200 million in mandatory authority for a new 
Expanding Opportunities for Teacher Leadership and Development program to support 
opportunities for experienced and effective teachers to lead and have a greater impact on their 
school community while remaining in the classroom (and be compensated for additional 
responsibilities) through such activities as high-quality teacher mentorship programs and job-
embedded coaching.  Lastly, the American Families Plan would double TEACH Grants from 
$4,000 to $8,000 for future teachers while earning their degrees.  
 
 
7 
 
IMPROVING CAREER PATHWAYS 
The President’s Request also recognizes that a skilled workforce is critical for both strong 
communities and a strong economy by proposing to make targeted investments that would help 
build the capacity of our workforce development system.  These investments include an increase 
of $108 million in Career and Technical Education National Programs to support an innovation 
grants initiative focused on youth work-based learning and industry credential attainment, along 
with a $25 million increase under Adult Education National Leadership Activities to expand 
college bridge programs for low-skilled adults without a high school degree. In addition, the 
American Jobs Plan would provide $1 billion in mandatory funding in fiscal year 2022 ($10 
billion total over 10 years) to expand career pathways for underserved middle and high school 
students that include partnerships with employers, community colleges and other partners and 
allow students to earn credentials or college credit while still in high school; and also would 
invest $100 million annually over the next 10 years to help connect job-seeking adults to 
employment opportunities by focusing on foundational skills and embedded career services.  
POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION INVESTMENTS 
Turning to higher education, our budget proposal would make postsecondary education 
more affordable for students from low-income households through a $400 increase to the 
maximum Pell Grant. In combination with the $1,475 increase to the maximum Pell Grant 
proposed in the American Families Plan, the increase in 2022 would be the largest increase to the 
Pell Grant ever.  This historic increase is just a first step in a more comprehensive proposal to 
double the grant.  Importantly, our proposal also would ensure that postsecondary students who 
are DACA recipients may receive Pell Grants and other federal aid if they meet current 
eligibility requirements. 
Through the American Families Plan, our budget proposal would provide two years of 
free community college to first-time students and those wishing to reskill.  It would also make 
 
8 
 
college more affordable for low- and middle-income students at four-year Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority 
Serving Institutions (MSIs) such as Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and Asian American 
and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs). 
The fiscal year 2022 request also would increase institutional capacity and student 
supports at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, and other under-resourced institutions, such as community 
colleges.   The discretionary request includes more than $600 million in additional funding for 
institutional supports programs and programs like TRIO and GEAR UP, to help ensure 
underserved students succeed in and graduate from college.   The American Families Plan also 
provides historic mandatory investments over ten years in college access and success, including 
$46 billion for HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, and $62 billion for a new Completion Grants program 
that would make formula grants to States to support the use of evidence-based strategies to 
strengthen completion and retention rates at institutions that serve students from our most 
disadvantaged communities like community colleges.     
SCHOOL INFRASTRUCTURE 
Too many students attend schools and child care centers that are run-down, unsafe, and 
pose health risks. These conditions are dangerous for our kids and exist disproportionately in 
schools with a high percentage of low-income students and students of color.  We can’t close the 
opportunity gap if low-income kids go to schools in buildings that undermine health and safety, 
while wealthier students get access to safe buildings with labs and technology that prepare them 
for the jobs of the future.  Accordingly, the American Jobs Plan would provide $10 billion in 
mandatory funding in 2022, and $50 billion over five years, for grants to upgrade existing school 
facilities and build new public elementary and secondary schools.  Outside of the Department of 
Education, funding would leverage an additional $50 billion in investments in school 
infrastructure through bonds. The American Jobs Plan would also provide $2.4 billion in 
 
9 
 
mandatory funding in 2022, and $12 billion over five years, for grants to invest in community 
college facilities and technology in order to help protect the health and safety of students and 
faculty, address education deserts (particularly for rural communities), grow local economies, 
improve energy efficiency and resilience, and narrow funding inequities. 
STUDENT AID ADMINISTRATION 
In addition to making college more affordable, our budget proposal will improve the 
services we provide students and families to help them pay for college.  We are requesting $2.1 
billion to administer the Federal student aid programs in fiscal year 2022, an increase of $200 
million over the fiscal year 2021 appropriation. The requested funds are necessary to implement 
the FAFSA® Simplification Act and FUTURE Act, which together will greatly ease the process 
of applying for student aid and accessing affordable, income-driven repayment options; provide 
high-quality loan servicing to more than 40 million student loan borrowers; and protect the 
personally identifiable information of around 75 million students and parents. 
ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS 
Finally, we would prioritize efforts to enforce the Nation’s civil rights laws, as they relate 
to education, through a 10 percent increase for the Office for Civil Rights to protect students, 
providing a total of $144 million to advance equity in educational opportunity and delivery at 
Pre-K through 12 schools and at institutions of higher education. 
CLOSING REMARKS 
Thank you again for this opportunity to share more about the President’s plan to invest in 
students of all ages and the institutions that serve them.  I look forward to hearing your reactions 
to this historic budget request, and to learning more about your individual interests and priorities 
related to Department of Education programs and activities.  I am committed to working 
collaboratively with each of you, to the greatest extent possible, to help improve educational 
opportunities and outcomes for all students.

before the 
 
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies 
Committee on Appropriations 
United States Senate 
 
 
Chairwoman Shaheen and Members of the Subcommittee, I am pleased to have this opportunity to 
discuss NASA's FY 2022 budget request of $24.8 billion.  This request represents an increase of $1.6 
billion, or 6.6 percent, above the FY 2021 enacted level. 
 
But first, I would like to thank you for your ongoing support for NASA.  This funding aligns closely with 
Administration priorities, including expanded climate change research; continued investment in human 
spaceflight through the International Space Station (ISS) and Artemis Programs that enhance global 
engagement and diplomacy; investments in cutting-edge research and development that fuel innovation, 
create high-paying jobs, grow the economy, and improve life on Earth; advancement of the U.S. aviation 
industrial base to build a green aviation system; and strengthening of a diverse Science, Technology, 
Engineering, and Math (STEM) workforce that inspires future generations.   
 
NASA is more than the world’s premier space exploration organization.  NASA is a uniquely powerful 
source of national inspiration and international leadership.  Over the past year, the NASA team has 
demonstrated remarkable resilience, overcoming COVID-19 challenges to press forward with a series of 
outstanding successes, including the historic first flight on another planet.  NASA’s landing of 
Perseverance on Mars is emblematic of an Agency, and a Nation, that can overcome challenges, to 
achieve whatever goals we set.  To quote the President on a phone call to NASA Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory (JPL):  
 
“We can land a rover on Mars.  We can beat a pandemic.  And with science, hope, and vision, 
there’s not a damn thing we can’t do as a country.” 
 
With the resources entrusted to us by Congress and the American people, and the dedicated efforts of our 
commercial partners, we have returned human spaceflight to American soil on American rockets.  
Adapting what we have learned from these efforts, we are moving rapidly to return Americans to the 
surface of the Moon as quickly as we can safely do so.  We are committed to landing the first woman and 
the first person of color on the Moon.  We will use all of this Nation’s capacity for innovation to develop 
the experience and capability around the Moon that will send Americans on to Mars.  We are building the 
Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion crew vehicle, to make deep space exploration possible, and we 
will soon launch the first, uncrewed mission in the Artemis lunar exploration program.  During this flight, 
targeted for this year, the spacecraft will fly farther than any spacecraft built for humans has ever flown.  
The budget request includes funding for the development of the Block 1B variant of SLS as well as 
funding for construction of a second Mobile Launcher, both of which will help support a robust Moon to 
Mars program.   
 
On April 16, 2021, NASA announced it had selected SpaceX to continue development of the first 
commercial human lander that will safely carry the next two American astronauts to the lunar surface.  
The firm-fixed price, milestone-based contract total award value is $2.89 billion, out of total requested 
five-year Human Landing System (HLS) funding of $7.8 billion.  This HLS contract award is under 
protest as of this time.  While the human landing demonstration award is under protest, NASA is 
continuing to prepare for competition for the follow-on landings to the lunar surface.  These services will 
provide human access to the lunar surface using the Gateway on a regularly recurring basis beyond the 
initial crewed demonstration mission.  By taking a collaborative approach in working with industry and 
international partners while leveraging NASA’s proven technical expertise and capabilities, we will return 
American astronauts to the Moon’s surface once again, this time to explore new areas for longer periods 
of time.   
 
For over 20 years, NASA has maintained a continuous human presence in Earth orbit, developing 
technology, skills, and knowledge needed for human exploration of the Moon and Mars.  The budget 
request ensures that there will be no gap in human presence in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) by continuing to 
invest in commercial LEO destinations and services.  The coming year will see a second commercial 
partner demonstrate crew transportation and begin regular crewed flights to the ISS.  This regular cadence 
of crew rotation missions will contribute to the foundation of a more affordable and sustainable future for 
American human spaceflight.  In addition, this will allow more capacity and resources for research and 
development projects on ISS, which are improving life on Earth and proving out the viability of a LEO 
economy.   
 
NASA is on Mars now and studying the planet more intensively than ever before.  The request includes 
funding to develop the mission that will return samples from Mars to Earth.  With the successful landing 
of the Perseverance rover, we are now operating two rovers, a lander, and a helicopter on the surface of 
Mars, supported by an array of orbiting spacecraft.  We continue to operate a constellation of spacecraft 
exploring the solar system while developing new missions to Earth’s Moon and Jupiter’s moon Europa, 
as well as a mission dedicated to detecting potentially hazardous Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).  Later this 
year, we will launch the Lucy mission to explore the Trojan asteroids in the vicinity of Jupiter, to be 
followed in 2022 by the Psyche mission to a metallic asteroid.  These asteroids are thought to be remnants 
of the primordial material that formed the outer planets.  NASA recently announced a major return to our 
nearest planetary neighbor, Venus, selecting not one but two missions that will be run out of the Planetary 
Missions Program Office at Marshall Space Flight Center.  The first mission, DAVINCI+, will measure 
the composition of Venus’ atmosphere to understand how it formed and evolved, as well as determine 
whether the planet ever had an ocean.  The second mission, VERITAS, will map Venus’s surface to 
determine the planet’s geologic history and understand why it developed so differently than Earth. 
   
NASA is a critical piece of the Administration’s efforts to understand and address global climate change.  
The request supports the continued development of high-priority missions including Plankton, Aerosol, 
Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE); Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) 
Pathfinder; and Landsat 9, while also supporting acquisition of Earth Science observation data for 
commercial SmallSat constellations.  In a major step forward for Earth Science, we have initiated a 
mission concept for NASA’s Earth System Observatory, a new architecture for deploying and integrating 
next-generation spaceborne Earth observation systems.  The Observatory includes development of four 
core strategic missions for launch this decade, and will provide the world an unprecedented understanding 
of the critical interactions between Earth’s atmosphere, land, ocean, and ice processes.  These processes 
define how the changing climate will play out at regional and local levels, and on near- to long-term time 
2 
 
scales.  The Earth System Observatory builds on NASA’s Earth Science Division’s current observations 
of Earth on a global scale, a fleet of 16 major Earth observatories plus six Earth observation instruments 
on the ISS, SmallSats, CubeSats, and missions flown by piloted and unpiloted aircraft.    
 
Later this year, NASA will launch the James Webb Space Telescope (Webb), the largest and most 
complex space science observatory ever built.  Webb is an infrared telescope designed to observe the 
farthest objects, broadening and transforming our understanding of the early universe.  It will see the light 
from the first galaxies that formed in the early universe after the Big Bang, and observe the birth of stellar 
systems, as well as explore distant worlds and study the atmospheres of planets orbiting other stars – 
known as exoplanets – searching for chemical fingerprints of habitability.  Webb will join a constellation 
of operating astrophysics observatories including the Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-Ray 
Observatory, and seven other operating missions.  The request supports the development of the Nancy 
Grace Roman Space telescope, designed to unravel the secrets of dark energy and dark matter, and to 
search for and image exoplanets.   
 
Supporting all of these efforts, NASA is developing new technologies ranging from robotic servicing 
technology to extend the life of orbiting spacecraft to laser communications for space.  Launching this 
year, the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration will showcase the unique capabilities of optical 
communications to radically increase the volume of information a signal can carry.  In FY 2022, NASA 
will deliver the Polar Resources Ice Mining Experiment-1 to Intuitive Machines, who will transport this 
first-of-its-kind, in situ resource utilization demonstration to the Moon.  This experiment will robotically 
sample and analyze ice from below the surface and study the drill cuttings for water and other chemical 
compounds to help scientists understand the potential of using resources found on the Moon.  The Low-
Earth Orbit Flight Test of an Inflatable Decelerator will complete fabrication of its flight hardware for an 
FY 2022 demonstration of space braking technology that will enable a variety of proposed NASA 
missions to destinations such as Mars, Venus, and Titan, as well as return to Earth.  The On-orbit 
Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing-2 project is working toward a late 2022 launch to build, 
assemble, and deploy its own operational solar arrays in space.  NASA is continuing to spur a vibrant 
space economy through a new Industry and Commerce Innovation opportunity that will invest in 
technologies needed by commercial space stakeholders. 
 
NASA’s aeronautics research will make significant contributions to the national effort to address global 
climate change, through vehicle technology development and advanced airspace operations, as well as 
serving as a vital source of innovation for the country’s leading export industry, commercial aviation.  
The request increases funding for planned green aviation initiatives across these programs and supports 
the continued development of the X-59 Low Boom Flight Demonstrator, as well as early designs of a 
Sustainable Flight Demonstrator.  This year, we will fly the first test flight of the X-57 Maxwell, NASA’s 
first all-electric X-plane – a major step forward in efforts to develop a more sustainable aeronautics 
industry. 
 
For the first time in many years, NASA’s budget request includes funding for its Office of STEM 
engagement.  With a significant increase over recent appropriated funding, the budget request for STEM 
engagement will increase investment in the Nation’s next generation of scientists, engineers, 
technologists, mathematicians, and explorers.   
 
NASA is uniquely positioned to support Administration priorities.  The Agency is helping to restore 
America’s global standing, demonstrating the power of a diverse, unified democracy to overcome 
challenges and achieve great goals.  As a source of innovation, and by directly promoting the growth of 
space and aeronautics industries, NASA plays an important supporting role in creating skilled, high-
paying jobs.  We are critical to the Administration’s efforts to expand climate research and investment in 
innovative sustainable technologies.  In addition, NASA is accelerating efforts to further diversity, equity, 
3 
 
and inclusion.  NASA has long understood that diversity, equity, and inclusion is not simply a matter of 
justice or fairness, but rather a source of strength and innovation and critical thinking.   
 
Conclusion 
 
The FY 2022 request demonstrates the President’s commitment to NASA and the people across the 
Agency and its partners who have worked so hard this past year under the most difficult circumstances 
and achieved unprecedented success.  The NASA workforce and the American people should be 
encouraged by what they see in this budget request.  It is an investment in our future, and it shows 
confidence in the broad array of benefits this Agency delivers for the Nation. 
 
Madam Chair, I would be pleased to respond to your questions and those of other Members of the 
Subcommittee.

Statement by 
Thomas J. Vilsack 
Secretary of Agriculture 
Before the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration, and Related Agencies 
 
Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate 
June 15, 2021 
 
Thank you, Chair Baldwin, Ranking Member Hoeven, and members of this 
Subcommittee, for inviting me here today to discuss the Administration’s priorities for the 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) and to provide you an overview of the President’s fiscal year 
(FY) 2022 budget for USDA.  
 
Under the President’s leadership, America is getting back on track. We have begun to 
turn the tide on the pandemic. Our economy is growing and creating jobs. Students are getting 
back into classrooms. For all the progress we’ve already made, we cannot simply return to the 
way things were before the pandemic and economic downturn. We must seize this moment to 
reimagine and rebuild a new American economy that invests in the promise and potential of 
every American and makes it easier for families to break into and stay in the middle class. In 
rural America—which holds a special claim to USDA’s mission—we must build back better, 
stronger, and more resilient and equitably than ever before.  
 
The Budget details the President’s proposals to advance that agenda this year. It includes 
the two historic plans the President has already put forward — the American Jobs Plan and the 
American Families Plan – and reinvests in education, research, public health, and other 
foundations of our country’s strength. It proposes historic investments to spur new job creation 
and opportunities in rural America; helps restore America’s advantage in agriculture; leverages 
all of USDA’s expertise to address climate change; and supports a stronger nutrition safety net.  
 
The President’s Budget for 2022 for USDA programs within this Subcommittee is $192 
billion, of which approximately $168 billion is mandatory funding and $23.2 billion is net 
discretionary funding. Its gives USDA a new set of tools, and builds on our existing capabilities, 
to address the urgent challenges of our time—containing the pandemic, responding to the 
1 
 
nutrition insecurity crisis, investing in research, rebuilding the rural economy, strengthening and 
building markets for farmers and producers, and addressing the impacts of climate change. This 
is not a list of things we would like to do—it is a plan for what we need to do to get USDA back 
on track and to help the U.S. outcompete the rest of the world.  
   
Supporting Nutrition for the Nation 
The pandemic underscored how critical USDA’s nutrition assistance programs are for 
millions of American families. At the peak last December, nearly one in seven households and 
more than one in six households with children reported they did not have enough to eat, with 
disproportionate impacts on communities of color. Fortunately, the collective efforts of Congress 
and the Administration—including measures enacted in the American Rescue Plan—have 
delivered help to struggling Americans and yielded meaningful reductions in food hardship since 
December. But even the latest reports tell us that about one in eight American households with 
children are still struggling with food hardship. It is not enough to return to where we were; as 
we build back better, we must tackle not only food insecurity, but also nutrition insecurity. 
USDA’s core nutrition programs are the most far-reaching, powerful tools available to 
ensure that all Americans, regardless of race, ethnicity, or background, have access to healthy, 
affordable food. Building on these programs, the Budget makes strategic investments to ensure 
those in need can access nutrition programs that are run efficiently and effectively; to advance 
nutrition security through education and evidence-based interventions; and to support the 
purchase of nutritious and local foods. I want to highlight just a few other key priorities.  
We know that WIC drives better health for infants and more nutritious diets for children, 
and it is a key tool to address disparities in maternal and child health outcomes. The Budget 
requests $6.7 billion for WIC to serve an estimated 6.4 million moms, infants, and young 
children in FY22, continuing the bipartisan commitment to full funding. It also extends the 
temporary increase in WIC Cash Value Benefits, which provide benefits to WIC participants to 
buy fruits and vegetables, increases funding for the WIC Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program, 
and bolsters the WIC Contingency Fund to ensure that services continue even in unforeseen 
circumstances.  
And the Budget reflects the bold $45 billion investment through American Families Plan 
to provide direct nutrition support to children and families. We proposed a permanent nationwide 
2 
 
Summer EBT program to provide food dollars to low-income families when school is out, a 
proven approach to improve low-income children’s food security and diet quality; expanding 
access to healthy school meals in high needs schools, with a focus on starting off strong in 
elementary schools, establishing a healthy foods incentive pilot in schools, and facilitating re-
entry for formerly incarcerated individuals through SNAP eligibility. 
The Budget also invests in the vital functions of the Food and Nutrition Service to deliver 
on this ambitious agenda. While federal funds managed by FNS have increased dramatically, as 
much as 70 percent in recent years, staffing levels have decreased. The Budget proposes 
significant investments in FNS to ensure the agency can provide appropriate oversight and 
stewardship, pursue its crucial mission to address food and nutrition security, and innovate and 
modernize to best serve those in need.  
 
Supporting Research 
To advance USDA’s priorities in a meaningful way, we must also deepen our support for 
the science that underpins them. American investment in research and development has fallen 
behind, a decision that, left uncorrected, will impact the clothes we wear, food we eat, and air we 
breathe.  
 
That’s why I am pleased that the President’s Budget course-corrects and positions the 
United States to be a leader in agricultural research. This budget proposes an increase of over 
$700 million for a total of $4.1 billion for USDA’s research, education, and outreach programs, 
an investment that will help USDA put science and data-driven tools and technologies in the 
hands of farmers. Advancing agricultural research will spur innovation and increase accessibility 
of climate-smart agricultural tools. The Budget includes almost $2 billion to research a wide 
range of critical problems facing American agriculture, ranging from animal and crop protection 
and production, new product development, environmental stewardship, food safety, and human 
nutrition. This includes increasing the Agriculture Food Research Initiative (AFRI) to $700 
million, an increase of $265 million to include broad emphasis throughout the AFRI program on 
climate-smart agriculture and application of clean energy.  
 
 
 
3 
 
 These investments complement what the President has called for as part of the American 
Jobs Plan, which includes a $10 billion R&D investment at Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities and other Minority Serving Institutions and $15 billion in creating up to 200 centers 
of excellence that serve as research incubators.  
 
Finally, the Budget will also help USDA’s research agencies rebuild both capacity and 
credibility after years of staff losses. We are setting big, bold research goals, and to meet those 
needs we must ensure that our staff is supported, inspired, and reflective of diverse communities 
across our country.  
 
Combating Climate Change 
Tackling climate change at home and abroad is one of the greatest challenges and 
opportunities of this century. This budget underscores the Biden-Harris Administration’s 
commitment to address the impacts of climate change with a comprehensive approach that’s 
inclusive of science and on-the-ground investments. It seeks to repair the broken link between 
our science and natural resource experts and our land and agriculture management mission areas.  
 
This budget puts USDA science agencies back in a leadership position among global 
competitors, like China. Our investments in climate research will put better tools, data and 
predictive technologies into the hands of producers and forest managers as they deal with hotter, 
drier, and more extreme weather. 
 
Our investments to advance innovation and application of science-based and data driven 
tools on the ground, will do the important extension and advisory work alongside farmers, 
ranchers, producers and foresters to support American agriculture and maintain our competitive 
edge in the world markets. The NRCS force on the ground, for example, has been hobbled and 
we need a conscious effort to rebuild.  
 
The USDA approach to tackling the climate crisis will focus on science driven 
technological climate science advancement, creating or maintaining resilient landscapes on all 
lands, increasing the work at our climate change hubs, and implementing innovative science and 
4 
 
evidence driven programs by investing over $914 million of new discretionary investments in 
climate smart agriculture and forestry activities, as well as $564 million of new investments for 
clean energy activities across USDA. This funding will support effective land management 
decisions and partnerships with local communities and Tribal Nations to address climate 
adaptation, conservation, and ecological resilience.  
 
The budget also provides seed funding to fulfill the President’s promise to create an 
Advanced Research Projects Agency for Climate (ARPA-C) that will support transformative 
solutions to address the climate crisis. It will be initially created in DOE to build on the 
experience and capabilities of ARPA-Energy (ARPA-E), but it will coordinate programs to 
address adaptation, resilience, and mitigation challenges with multiple agencies.  We are 
requesting $95 million for ARPA-C that will enable us to work with ARPA-C and support the 
critical climate technologies that an ARPA approach could most rapidly provide solutions. 
 
These investments complement what the President has proposed as part of the American 
Jobs Plan, which calls on Congress to invest $45 billion in the full range of solutions needed to 
achieve technology breakthroughs that address the climate crisis and position America as the 
global leader in clean energy technology and clean energy jobs, led by renewable fuel, renewable 
energy, and a host of biobased products grown and manufactured here in the United States by 
rural Americans. 
 
Rebuilding Rural America  
United States’ prosperity and well-being are intrinsically tied to rural America’s ability to 
thrive in the new global economy. The President’s budget proposal enables USDA to closely 
examine the systemic issues facing rural America and empower communities to take the reins as 
they rebuild their economies, workforces, and infrastructure.  
Our rural communities share an impressive diversity and resilience, and they face unique 
challenges that deserve unique solutions. When well resourced, Rural Development provides 
support that is critical to improving quality of life in rural America – whether it is through 
increased access to broadband service, affordable housing in underserved communities, or 
5 
 
resilient wastewater infrastructure. USDA is committed to taking a locally focused approach to 
addressing these challenges because I know that when these communities have a seat at the table, 
we have the best shot at achieving a long-lasting inclusive prosperity. 
To bring these outcomes into reality, the budget proposal increases funding for Rural 
Development by $741 million, including an increase of $446 million for electric and 
telecommunication programs, $15 million for the Rural Housing Service, and more than $100 
million for Rural Development to increase its staff and technological capacity. It’s difficult to 
innovate when you are overextended, so these capacity-building resources will be critical to 
better serving our rural customers.  
The budget increases USDA’s investment in expanding rural broadband service to put 
rural America on a long-term path to economic success. The budget includes $700 million for 
ReConnect, an increase of $65 million over the 2021 enacted level, to provide flexible loans and 
grants to deploy broadband to unserved areas. This investment also builds on the $100 billion of 
funding proposed in the American Jobs Plan, which aims to connect every American. COVID-19 
has underscored how critical access to broadband is to all Americans, and rural Americans are 
more than 10 times likelier than urban residents to lack access to quality broadband. The 
Administration’s plan to connect Americans is innovative, ambitious and creates a blueprint to 
carry rural American into the future. 
The President’s budget proposes $717 million in investments for Rural Water and 
Wastewater Grants and Loans, an increase of $100 million over the 2021 enacted level. That 
funding includes $25 million for grants targeted to Colonias, Native Americans, and Alaska 
Native Villages and $75 million for grants targeted to rural, poor communities. Safe drinking 
water and sanitary waste disposal systems are vital to achieving a high quality of life and are 
essential to rural residents. The proposed increase would create good-paying jobs and help 
thousands of communities across rural America gain access to clean drinking water. 
When I last served as the Secretary of Agriculture, USDA implemented a public-private 
partnership initiative known as “StrikeForce” to provide targeted economic development 
resources to rural counties with persistent poverty, including communities that are economically 
dependent on energy resources. Through this effort, USDA collaborated, leveraged, and 
6 
 
increased investments to rural communities through cooperation and partnerships with other 
Federal agencies, State and local governments, and public and private entities. The StrikeForce 
initiative was very successful, but with the experience of time we can further improve on this 
critical program. With $32 million of proposed funding in the FY 2022 budget, USDA will build 
upon the lessons learned from past efforts and scale a more holistic all of government approach 
to improving economic mobility and community development outcomes in rural, urban, and 
tribal areas alike. USDA is committed to ensuring that communities have the tools and support to 
identify, access, and effectively leverage federal resources to rebuild rural America. 
    The FY 2022 budget lays out a plan for USDA to address critical issues within the food 
supply chain, the impacts of climate change, and the pressures on our public and private lands – 
each of which will require the requested budget levels to address. As I stated at the beginning of 
my testimony, the Budget is not a list of things we would like to do, it is a list of things we must 
do. I look forward to working with this Subcommittee and to answering any questions you may 
have about our budget proposals.

Statement by 
Janet Woodcock, M.D.  
Acting Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Food and Drug Administration 
Before the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies 
Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate
Chair Baldwin, Ranking Member Hoeven, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the 
opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the President’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget (Budget) 
request for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency).
I would like to begin by thanking the Subcommittee for your continued support of the Agency in 
recent years, and in particular the past year as the Agency has worked to address the current COVID-19 
public health emergency. The funding increases that the Subcommittee provided to FDA have been 
essential to the Agency fulfilling its critical mission. 
Today, I am pleased to present FDA’s FY 2022 Budget Request. Our program level request totals 
$6.5 billion, which is comprised of $3.6 billion in discretionary budget authority and $2.9 billion in user 
fees. This is an increase of eight percent, or $477 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level. The Budget 
requests a net budget authority increase of $322 million, which reflects $343 million in requested 
increases and scheduled adjustments of -$21 million to reflect the authorized level for 21st Century 
Cures and the one-time funding provided in FY 2021. The Budget focuses on necessary investments in 
three main categories: (1) critical public health infrastructure; (2) core FDA safety programs; and,  
(3) public health issues confronting the nation today.

I.  Critical Public Health Infrastructure
FDA’s Budget requests an increase of $185 million to support our critical 
public health infrastructure. This infrastructure is fundamental to every aspect of 
our work. Challenges faced during the current pandemic have reinforced the need 
to ensure that the Agency is making consistent, smart investments with respect to 
our physical and technological infrastructure so that we are prepared to effectively 
fulfill our core mission and tackle unpredictable public health crises. 
With that in mind, the Agency’s infrastructure request includes critically 
important investments in data modernization, maintenance and repairs to our 
facilities, expanded laboratory safety efforts, and an increase in internal capacity 
to support our workforce of over 18,000, including targeted investments in the 
Office of Chief Counsel, cybersecurity, IT equipment replacement, and business 
functions within the Office of Operations. A few of these investments requested in 
this year’s Budget are highlighted in more detail below.

Data Modernization 
The Budget requests an increase of $75.9 million to support FDA data 
modernization efforts. As witnessed firsthand during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
technology has and will continue to revolutionize human and animal health. 
Scientific breakthroughs have enabled the development of new, more personalized 
therapeutic treatments, advanced manufacturing, and state-of-the-art solutions 
such as blockchain, genomic information, and real-time analytics. As a byproduct, 
the amount and variety of data that FDA generates, needs, and uses is rapidly 
increasing at exponential rates. However, the Agency utilizes antiquated methods, 
including inspecting large volumes of PDFs, often “by hand,” in order to identify 
critical safety signals, such as human and animal drug and device safety concerns 
or emerging foodborne outbreaks. 
2  FY 2022 FDA Budget Written Statement
In response, the Budget requests investments to modernize the Agency’s data 
infrastructure. The request includes two components—an Agency-wide component 
($44.5 million) and complementary program-specific investments ($31.4 million). 
Combined, this funding will allow FDA to more efficiently gather data; identify, 
analyze and respond to potential problems more quickly; and, to further improve 
review times for medical products.
Buildings and Facilities Infrastructure 
The Budget requests an increase of $37.5 million for FDA’s owned and leased 
facilities’ needs. FDA’s facilities requirements during any given year are diverse 
and cover 77 FDA-owned buildings at six locations across the U.S. and Puerto 
Rico and approximately 265 leased buildings, including 53 laboratories. Repairs 
and upgrades needed at these facilities vary from basic maintenance to complex 
laboratory retrofits. This requested increase will allow FDA to better operate, 
maintain, and secure its owned and leased facilities, as well as make necessary 
repairs and improvements at both the FDA White Oak Campus and FDA owned 
buildings across the country. FDA’s current backlog of maintenance and repairs 
at our owned locations is greater than $220 million and places a considerable 
strain on the Agency’s ability to execute its mission. Maximizing the public health 
value of FDA funding is paramount and we will continue to prioritize our facility 
investments to ensure that our owned and FDA-occupied facilities are efficient, 
cost-effective and meet the demands of FDA’s expanding workload and workforce.

II. Core FDA Safety Programs
FDA’s responsibilities continue to expand and grow in complexity due 
to advances in food and medical product technology, globalization of supply 
chains, increasingly complex and diverse data sources, and emerging scientific 
approaches. The nation relies on FDA to provide rigorous and transparent 
scientific review, a predictable and responsive regulatory structure, comprehensive 
inspections at domestic and foreign food and medical product manufacturers, 
and expert staff to provide support for these activities. The Budget requests 
an increase of $97 million to invest in core food and medical product safety 
programs to reduce the number of foodborne illnesses through implementation 
of the New Era of Smarter Food Safety Blueprint; improve maternal and infant 
nutrition and health; address emerging food-related chemical and toxicological 
issues; strengthen oversight of animal foods, strengthen and monitor the device 
supply chain; and increase drug safety surveillance and oversight. A few of the 
investments requested in this year’s Budget are highlighted in more detail below.

Maternal and Infant Nutrition and Health Initiative 
Nutrition during pregnancy and in early childhood is critically important in 
supporting the health and wellbeing of mothers and their children and key to 
promoting health equity. Nutrients vital for brain development and growth must 
be provided in adequate amounts during early years, whereas certain dietary 
constituents should be limited, and some should be avoided altogether to prevent 
potentially irreversible harm. Infants, young children, and the developing fetus are 
especially vulnerable to toxic elements (e.g., lead, cadmium, arsenic, and mercury) 
due to small body size and rapid growth and development.
With its available regulatory tools and authorities, the FDA is uniquely 
positioned to advance work that promotes healthy dietary patterns and 
consumption of essential nutrients for pregnant women, infants and young 
FY 2022 FDA Budget Written Statement   5
children, while mitigating risk of dietary exposure to toxic elements harmful for 
growth and development in early life. As such, the Budget requests $18 million 
to support work that advances both nutrition and food safety at the Center for 
Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN). The funding will support three 
components: (1) Enhancing Infant Formula Premarket Review; (2) Addressing 
Toxic Elements in foods commonly consumed by babies and young children; and 
(3) Promoting Dietary Patterns Recommended by the Dietary Guidelines while 
Mitigating Risk of Exposure to Dietary Toxicants. This funding will expand the 
Agency’s capacity to review the increasing number, size, and complexity of infant 
formula submissions and will push to reduce exposure to toxic elements from 
foods eaten by babies and young children to as low as possible.

Medical Product Supply Chain
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed great weaknesses in the medical product 
supply chain’s dependence on foreign medical products. To ensure the U.S. is 
properly prepared now, and in the future, we must take action to secure our 
medical product supply chain, including related ingredients and components. 
The Budget requests an increase of $21.6 million for a new Resilient Supply 
Chain and Shortages Program at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health 
(CDRH). This funding will provide resources to establish a permanent program for 
U.S. supply chain resilience for medical devices for the first time. The funding will 
help to stand up this program that will focus on strengthening the domestic supply 
chain through investments in preventive measures, identifying potential medical 
product supply short-falls, continuing surveillance, and rapid intervention. 
6  FY 2022 FDA Budget Written Statement
FDA is also requesting an additional $2.3 million for medical product supply 
chain efforts by the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) to strengthen its data 
analytics capacity to help identify and anticipate the effects of the public health 
emergencies on the animal drug supply. Finally, FDA is requesting an increase of 
$5.6 million for Drug Safety Surveillance and Oversight activities for the Center 
for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER).
III. Public Health Issues Confronting the United States
In addition to strengthening our fundamental infrastructure and supporting 
our core medical product and food safety programs, in the upcoming year we 
must also focus on the most pressing public health issues facing our country.  
While the COVID-19 pandemic has dominated headlines over the past year, 
other longstanding health challenges have surged back into the spotlight and 
our Budget requests an additional $61 million to further our efforts to address 
these public health challenges.  Funding will support several activities, including, 
efforts to increase safe and secure inspections, promote health equity, and address 
the opioid crisis.  A few of these investments requested in this year’s Budget are 
highlighted below in more detail below. 
Public Health Investments (in millions)

Safe and Secure Inspections
FDA’s inspectional activities, 
coordinated by the Office of Regulatory 
Affairs (ORA), play a crucial role in 
the mission of the Agency to protect 
consumers and enhance public health 
by ensuring access to FDA regulated 
products and minimizing risk associated 
with those products.  ORA inspects 
regulated products and manufacturers, 
conducts sample analyses of regulated 
FY 2022 FDA Budget Written Statement   7
products and reviews imported products offered for entry into the United States.  
To support our critical inspection work in the upcoming fiscal year, our Budget 
requests an increase of $18.8 million to ORA’s base funding to support for our 
inspections program. 
With support from COVID-19 supplemental funding, ORA is working on 
COVID-19 recovery activities including inspectional modernization, preparing 
to adjust staffing and onboarding new staff to support onsite inspections.  The 
resources requested as part of the FY 2022 Budget will allow ORA to maintain 
the staff hired with supplemental funding and increase our foreign inspection 
teams.  We are also actively working to expand upon the use of remote assessment 
tools where appropriate, such as remote livestreaming video of operations, 
teleconferences, or screen sharing.  These remote assessments, used in 
combination with other tools, enable the FDA’s investigators to assess the level of 
compliance and process control at sites.
Expand health equity and health disparity efforts
I am pleased to request an increase of $4.7 million to enhance FDA’s ability 
to support and expand health equity and health disparity efforts. The COVID-19 
pandemic is only the latest example of the disproportionate impact public health 
problems have on minority and underserved communities. This funding will 
allow FDA to expand culturally and linguistically tailored communication and 
outreach efforts, establish new scientific initiatives, support novel health disparity 
and health equity focused intramural and extramural research, advance activities 
that enhance meaningful inclusion of minority populations in clinical trials, and 
understand and address health disparities. In addition, the funding will allow 
FDA to increase engagement with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, 
Minority Serving Institutions, and other collaborators to address gaps and needs 
of underserved communities, and develop FDA-wide training programs that focus 
on the reduction of health disparities and advancement of health equity. 
Ending the Opioid Crisis
FDA will continue to address the opioid crisis that has only been exacerbated 
by the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of HHS’s Department-wide initiative to 
Advance the Goal of Ending the Opioids Crisis, in FY 2022 FDA requests an 
increase of $38 million to support activities in CDER, ORA, and CDRH. As part 
of the initiative, CDER will receive $26 million to support development of opioid 
overdose reversal treatments and treatments for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). 
CDER will, among other activities advance the development and adoption of 
evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for acute pain conditions; assess 
feasibility to integrate opioid Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) 
8  FY 2022 FDA Budget Written Statement
education into IT health systems/Electronic Health Records and explore use of 
health IT systems to support goals of REMS, such as prescriber education; and 
continue to support opioid research efforts. Within CDRH, $2 million will be 
invested in efforts that will allow FDA to advance the development, evaluation, 
and market authorization of digital health medical devices that help address OUD. 
Finally, of the $38 million increase, the Budget will provide ORA $10 million 
to establish satellite laboratories at the Agency’s International Mail Facilities 
(IMFs). FDA staff are assigned to nine IMFs throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands and are responsible for monitoring mail importations of 
FDA regulated products by conducting comprehensive examinations of packages 
suspected of containing drugs to determine if those drugs should be refused 
delivery to the U.S. consumer. The Budget request will also fund permanent 
staffing at the IMFs by scientists along with expanding ORA’s use of analytical tools 
for screening entries, expand the current 
IMF initiative to interdict shipments 
of opioids, unapproved foreign drugs, 
counterfeit pharmaceuticals and 
health fraud related shipments, and 
support Pharmacy Compounding and 
Outsourcing Facility inspections,  
which include an inspectional 
assessment for compounding or 
repackaging of opioid products.
IV. Conclusion  
I would like to close by thanking the Subcommittee again for your continued 
support of the Agency. As the gold standard for protecting and promoting public 
health, FDA is trusted by Americans and admired around the world for our work 
ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of our nation’s medical products and the 
safety of our food supply. Once again, thank you for inviting me. I look forward to 
answering your questions.

TESTIMONY OF SECRETARY BECERRA 
BEFORE THE SENATE L-HHS APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE  
June 9, 2021 
 
Chair Murray, Ranking Member Blunt, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to discuss the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 Budget for the Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS).  I am pleased to appear before you, and I look forward to 
continuing to work with you. 
 
HHS is at the center of many challenges facing our country today—the COVID-19 pandemic, 
safely caring for unaccompanied children at our southern border, the overdose and the addiction 
epidemic gun violence, racial inequality, and more—and we are rising to meet those challenges.  
I am honored to be given the responsibility to lead HHS at this time.  
 
COVID-19 has shed light on how health inequities and insufficient Federal funding can leave 
communities vulnerable to crises.  The President’s Budget invests in America, demonstrates a 
conscious effort to address racial disparities in health care, tackles the opioid and other drug 
crises, and puts us on a better footing to take on the next public health crisis. 
 
Now more than ever, we must ensure that HHS has the resources to achieve its mission and 
tackle these challenges after years of underfunding.  The President has put forward a budget that 
does just that.  The FY 2022 budget proposes $131.8 billion in discretionary budget authority 
and $1.5 trillion in mandatory funding.  The Labor-HHS total is $119.5 billion, an increase of 
$23 billion.  Investments in the budget support families in areas such as behavioral health 
(mental health and substance use), maternal health, emerging health threats, science, data and 
research, tribal health, early child care and learning, and child welfare.  
 
To build back a prosperous America, we need a healthy America, and President Biden’s budget 
builds on that vision while investing in the many programs housed at HHS to save lives.  
 
Preparing for and Responding to Public Health Crises 
 
The fight against COVID-19 is not yet over.  Even as HHS works to beat this pandemic, we are 
also preparing for the next public health crisis.  The FY 2022 budget makes significant 
investments in our preparedness and response capabilities.   
 
The Strategic National Stockpile, within the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
Preparedness and Response, has served a critical role in the COVID-19 response, permitting 
rapid deployment of personal protective equipment, ventilators, and medical supplies to states, 
cities, tribes, and territories across the country.  The budget provides $905 million for the 
stockpile, $200 million above FY 2021, to ensure that the stockpile is ready to respond to future 
pandemic events and any other public health threats while maintaining a robust inventory of 
critical medical supplies, enhancing visibility of the domestic supply chain, and modernizing the 
1 
 
stockpile’s distribution model.  In addition, the budget provides $823 million, $227 million 
above FY 2021, for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which has 
supported the development of new vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics for the COVID-19 
response.  Additional resources will support improved medical countermeasure platforms that 
will enable quicker, more effective detection and public health and medical responses to health 
security threats.  The budget also supports a strong public health workforce, and addresses gaps 
in the existing public health infrastructure, including at the state and local levels.  In addition to 
discretionary investments, the budget includes $30 billion over four years in mandatory funding 
for HHS, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Energy to protect Americans from 
future pandemics and create U.S. jobs through major new investments in medical 
countermeasures manufacturing; research and development; and related biopreparedness and 
biosecurity investments. 
 
During this pandemic, we have seen the critical role of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC).  To ensure that CDC is well positioned to address current and emerging 
public health threats, the budget restores capacity to the world’s preeminent public health agency 
by investing an additional $1.6 billion over the FY 2021 level for a discretionary funding total of 
$8.7 billion.  This is the largest budget authority increase for CDC in almost two decades.  A 
core function of CDC is partnering with state, tribal, local, and territorial entities, and this 
funding will enhance those partnerships.  The budget will also provide CDC with additional 
resources to further develop and expand teams of highly trained and deployable public health 
experts to support preparedness at the local level. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has also shown the importance of producing reliable data.  Bad inputs 
lead to bad outputs, and without good data, CDC cannot effectively prepare for, or respond to, 
public health threats and make well-informed decisions to protect the American people.  With 
funding provided in the FY 2022 budget, CDC will build upon previous investments in the data 
infrastructure to date and continue efforts to modernize public health data collection and analysis 
nationwide.   
 
Public health threats know no borders, and CDC is working to prevent, detect, and respond to 
epidemic threats at home and abroad.  With CDC experts embedded in countries around the 
world, CDC is supporting global COVID-19 response by leveraging core public health capacities 
and relationships built through decades of CDC global health activities. As we continue to 
confront new and emerging COVID-19 variants, as well as a surge of cases in India, support for 
CDC’s work is even more important.  CDC is working closely with U.S. government agencies, 
ministries of health, and other partners to assist countries in responding to COVID-19, while 
simultaneously developing and implementing adaptations to interventions for malaria, HIV, and 
vaccine-preventable diseases.  With the President’s proposed FY 2022 investments, CDC will 
not only address preparedness within the United States, but will also support core public health 
capacity improvements overseas and strengthen global health security by improving our ability 
to deploy experts internationally and support efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to emerging 
global biological threats.  CDC will invest in global health security and continue to fight health 
2 
 
threats worldwide while simultaneously enhancing domestic preparedness to address threats here 
at home.  Domestic health is increasingly impacted by global factors and CDC’s global health 
security efforts include conducting research to ensure efficient disease response.  
 
The Assistant Secretary for Preparednes and Response (ASPR) and CDC investments 
complement preparedness activities across HHS including basic and clinical research within 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) and activities within the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) to advance regulatory science and mitigate potential supply or drug shortages. 
 
While we prepare for future pandemic threats, we are also facing a public health crisis that is 
already here: violence in our communities.  The current public health emergency has shone a 
light on the issue of domestic and gender-based violence.  More than 1 in 4 women and more 
than 1 in 10 men have experienced contact sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an 
intimate partner and reported significant impacts.  The budget provides $489 million for the 
Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to support and protect domestic violence 
survivors, which is more than double the FY 2021 enacted levels.  The budget also provides 
$66 million for victims of human trafficking and survivors of torture, more than 45 percent 
above FY 2021 enacted levels.  
 
We have also seen the devastating impact of gun violence in communities across the country.  
Almost 40,000 people die as a result of firearm injuries in the United States every year, while 
homicide is the third leading cause of death for people ages 10-24.  This is a public health issue, 
and one that disproportionately impacts communities of color.  The budget addresses this crisis  
by doubling CDC and NIH funding for firearm violence prevention research.  The budget 
provides $100 million in discretionary funding to CDC to start a new Community Violence 
Intervention initiative, in collaboration with the Department of Justice, to implement evidence-
based community violence interventions at the local level.  In addition to the discretionary 
investment for the Community Violence Intervention initiative, the budget includes a total of $5 
billion in mandatory funding for CDC and the Department of Justice, beginning in FY 2023 and 
continuing through FY 2029. 
 
The climate crisis has real public health impacts, and the HHS’ mission depends on healthy and 
sustainable environments.  HHS thus has a major role to play in the Administration’s 
government-wide effort to tackle this crisis.  HHS’ investments to combat climate change in the 
FY 2022 Budget will advance health equity, lay the foundations for economic growth, and 
ensure that benefits from tackling the climate crisis accrue to tribal communities, communities of 
color, low-income households, and disadvantaged communities that have been marginalized or 
overburdened.  The budget includes a $100 million increase in NIH funding to support research 
aimed at understanding the health impacts of climate change, as well as an additional $100 
million investment in CDC’s Climate and Health program to support efforts to understand and 
identify potential health effects, including children’s environmental health considerations 
associated with climate change and implement plans to adapt to a changing environment.  The 
American Jobs Plan also would invest $1.5 billion to increase the resilience of hospitals and 
3 
 
critical infrastructure, fund health emergency preparedness cooperative agreements, and build 
resilience including in relation to the effects of a changing climate. 
 
Caring for all Americans Through Health and Human Services 
 
Central to the HHS mission is the charge to enhance the health and well-being of all Americans.  
The budget invests in areas across HHS to ensure that we are equitably serving the American 
people.  As Secretary, I will ensure that this focus is fundamental to all of our work.   
 
A critical part of this is investing in civil rights enforcement to ensure that all people receiving 
services from HHS-conducted or HHS-funded programs, no matter who they are, or where they 
live, can receive health care free from discrimination. 
 
The FY 2022 Budget makes expanding affordable health care access a priority across Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services programs.  A recently released report titled “Health Coverage 
Under the Affordable Care Act: Enrollment Trends and State Estimates” shows that the 
Affordable Care Act (ACA) has expanded health insurance coverage to millions of Americans,  
and the budget goes even further.  It builds on the groundbreaking reforms introduced in the 
American Rescue Plan Act by extending the enhanced premium subsidies that put affordable 
health care coverage within reach of millions more Americans.  These improvements in the 
American Rescue Plan Act are lowering premiums for more than nine million current enrollees 
by an average of $50 per person per month.  In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an 
ongoing opportunity to apply for enrollment in Marketplace health care coverage is available on 
HealthCare.gov through August 15.  This extension provides individuals and families a 
desperately needed opportunity to get quality, affordable health insurance coverage.  As of May 
10, over 1 million additional Americans have signed up for health insurance through the 
Marketplace, and an additional 2 million obtained improved benefits through the Marketplace, 
benefitting from both reduced premiums and more affordable cost sharing. 
 
The FY 2022 Budget also expands access to critical home- and community-based services 
(HCBS) under Medicaid, critical health care services that allow older people and people with 
disabilities to live independently in their homes and communities.  The budget builds on the 
additional Medicaid funding included in the American Rescue Plan that not only expands access 
to these important services but also strengthens state HCBS programs by allowing states to use 
the additional money to, for example, provide additional benefits, like mental health and 
substance use services, to beneficiaries, as well as to raise wages and provide paid leave for 
home care workers.   
 
I look forward to working with the Congress to achieve the Administration’s goal of lower costs 
and expanded and improved coverage for all Americans.  This includes reforms to lower the 
costs of prescription drugs, such as allowing Medicare to negotiate payment for certain high-cost 
drugs, and requiring manufacturers to pay rebates when drug prices rise faster than inflation.  We 
will also work to improve Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and private insurance coverage, by 
4 
 
pursuing changes such as improving access to dental, hearing, and vision coverage in Medicare, 
making it easier for eligible people to get and stay covered in Medicaid, promoting Early and 
Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) requirements for eligible youth, and 
reducing out-of-pocket costs for individuals in private insurance coverage obtained through the 
Marketplace.  The Administration also supports additional public coverage options, including a 
public option that would be available through the insurance marketplaces.  Health care is a right, 
not a privilege, and I will work to ensure that families across the nation are able to secure this 
right.  
 
The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations, with an 
unacceptably high mortality rate for Black and American Indian/Alaska Native women.  
Addressing this critical public health issue is a major priority of this Administration, as 
evidenced by the American Rescue Plan’s state option to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage.  
Building on HHS’s longstanding efforts to improve maternal health, including the Department’s 
recent Medicaid postpartum waiver approvals, the budget provides more than $220 million in 
discretionary funding to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity by implementing evidence-
based interventions to address critical gaps in maternity care service delivery and improve 
maternal health outcomes.  This includes increased funding to CDC’s Maternal Mortality 
Review Committees and the Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA) Rural 
Maternity and Obstetrics Management Strategies program.  HRSA also prioritizes maternal 
health through its Title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant and Alliance for Innovation on 
Maternal Health programs.  As with all our public health work, collecting good data will be 
critical.  In addition to these discretionary resources, the budget includes $3 billion in mandatory 
funding over five years, to invest in maternal health and reduce the maternal mortality rate and 
end race-based disparities in maternal mortality. 
 
HRSA’s work is central to our focus on serving all Americans, given their mission to improve 
health outcomes and address health disparities.  HRSA-funded Health Centers provide access to 
care for low-income and marginalized populations, and they serve 1 in 11 people in the nation.  
The President’s Budget increase to workforce diversity programs, highlights HRSA’s 
commitment to supporting health care providers dedicated to working in underserved areas and 
building toward a workforce that reflects the communities it serves and is able to provide 
culturally relevant care.   
 
The budget provides $670 million across HHS to continue efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the 
United States by working closely with communities that have high rates of HIV transmission to 
implement effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies, including ones that address 
the disproportionate impact of HIV and Hepatitis C infections in Tribal communities.  HHS 
programs have already made major progress in combating the HIV epidemic.  HRSA ensures 
equitable access to services and supports for low-income people with HIV through Health 
Centers as well as the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.  In 2019, 88.1 percent of those served 
under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program had achieved viral suppression, a record level that 
5 
 
exceeds the national average of 64.7 percent.  HHS will build on this work to end the epidemic 
once and for all.  
 
Also, directly connected to the HHS mission is the need to provide access to high-quality care, 
no matter where you live.  HHS will continue to focus on the unique needs of rural communities.  
HHS administers a range of programs that address rural health, from those that serve large 
populations such as Health Centers, to those serving targeted populations such as the Black Lung 
Clinics Program.  The FY 2022 budget serves active, inactive, retired, and disabled coal miners 
and their families through high-quality medical, outreach, educational, and benefits counseling 
services.  It also provides funding to increase the number of individuals receiving training and 
serving in health professions in rural communities, as research has shown that providers are 
likely to remain in the communities where they train as residents. 
 
HHS will also address the stark health disparities that persist in Tribal communities by investing 
in the Indian Health Service (IHS), which serves over 2.6 million American Indians and Alaska 
Natives.  The COVID-19 pandemic’s devastating impact on Tribal communities has 
demonstrated the real human toll of these disparities.  The budget provides a $2.2 billion, or 
36 percent, increase for IHS in order to take a historic step to address chronic underfunding, 
expand access to high-quality health care, and address critical facilities and information 
technology infrastructure deficiencies across Indian Country.  For the first time, the budget also 
proposes advance appropriations for IHS to provide stability for the Indian Health system and 
parity with how other Federal health agencies are funded.  I am committed to strengthening the 
Nation-to-Nation relationship between the United States and Indian Tribes.  To this end, the 
budget supports self-determination through a consultative process to consider long-term 
solutions, including mandatory funding, to ensure adequate and stable funding for IHS. 
 
The budget also provides an 18.7 percent increase to the Title X Family Planning program to 
improve access to vital reproductive and preventive care and to advance gender equity.  Over the 
last two years, nearly half of the programs supported by Title X lost providers as a result of the 
2019 regulation which added burdensome restrictions inconsistent with quality care guidelines 
and ultimately resulted in many highly qualified, longstanding healthcare entities to exit Title X.  
The budget allows Title X to not only restore highly qualified providers, but also to expand its 
essential services to meet increased demand as a result of the global pandemic and resulting 
recession.  In 2019, Title X-funded clinics served almost 3.1 million Americans, 66 percent of  
whom had incomes at or below the federal poverty level and 41 percent of  whom were 
uninsured.  This is nearly 1 million fewer people served than in 2018. 
 
Investing in Children’s Futures 
 
Our experiences as children shape the adults we become, and support in childhood can mean 
success in the future.  As Frederick Douglass wrote, “It is easier to build strong children than to 
repair broken men.”  High-quality early care and education lay a strong foundation so that 
children can take full advantage of education and training opportunities later in life.  The 
6 
 
American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan invest in school and child care 
infrastructure and workforce training, and ensure that low and middle-income families pay no 
more than 7 percent of their income on high-quality child care. These investments include 
$200 billion over ten years for a national partnership with states to offer free, high-quality, 
accessible, and inclusive preschool to all three- and four-year-olds, benefitting five million 
children.  The budget also invests $250 billion over ten years to make child care affordable.   
 
The budget also provides $19.8 billion in discretionary funding for the Department’s early care 
and education programs in ACF, $2.8 billion over FY 2021 enacted.  This includes $11.9 billion 
for Head Start, which helps young children enter kindergarten ready to learn.  Head Start 
programs deliver services through 1,600 agencies in local communities, and they provide 
services to more than a million children and pregnant women every year, in every U.S. state and 
territory.  In addition, the budget provides $7.4 billion for the Child Care and Development 
Block Grant, $1.5 billion over FY 2021 enacted, to expand access to high-quality child care for 
families in all corners of the country.  Over a million children receive child care subsidies every 
month funded by the Child Care and Development Fund, and nearly half of the families 
receiving child care subsidies reported income below the Federal Poverty Level.  These 
investments will improve outcomes for children across the country. 
 
The budget also invests in improvements to the child welfare system, particularly to address its 
racial inequity.  The budget provides $100 million in new competitive grants for states and 
localities to advance reforms that would reduce the overrepresentation of children and families of 
color in the child welfare system and address the disparate experiences and outcomes of these 
families.  This funding will also give more families the support they need to remain safely 
together.  The budget also provides $200 million for states and community-based organizations 
to respond to, and prevent, child abuse, over 30 percent above FY 2021 enacted. 
 
Combating Mental Health and Substance Use Crises 
 
HHS must address the public health crises associated with mental health and substance use 
disorders.  This need is especially urgent given that both crises have accelerated during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.  Calls to mental health helplines have increased across the country as 
Americans struggle with increased anxiety, depression, risk of suicide, and trauma-related 
disorders resulting from the pandemic.  Younger adults, racial minorities, essential workers, and 
unpaid adult caregivers are particularly impacted.  Similarly, preliminary data from 2020 
suggests that overdose deaths, which were already increasing, accelerated at an unprecedented 
rate during the pandemic.  Provisional data suggest that over 90,000 drug overdose deaths 
occurred in the United States in the 12 months ending in September 2020. That represents a year-
over-year increase of close to 29 percent.1 This crisis is also evolving—overdose deaths 
                                                           
1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2021). Vital Statistics Rapid Release: Provisional Drug Overdose 
Death Counts. Retrieved May 6, 2021 at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm  
7 
 
involving substances other than opioids are also increasing.  HHS will ensure that our work is 
responsive to the needs of communities across the country. 
The budget addresses these crises through investments in the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration.   
 
In a historic investment, the budget provides $1.6 billion to the Community Mental Health 
Services Block Grant to respond to the systemic strain on our country’s mental health care 
system—more than double the FY 2021 level.  To address the undeniable connection between 
the criminal justice system and mental health, the discretionary request will also invest in 
programs for people involved in the criminal justice system.  HHS will also focus on the 
behavioral impact of COVID-19, including on children.  When children and young people face 
Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) such as trauma, it can continue to affect them across 
their lifespan, so it is critical we intervene now to support their social, emotional, and mental 
well-being. 
 
The budget also takes action to address addiction and the overdose epidemic, investing 
$11.2 billion across HHS, $3.9 billion more than in FY 2021, including $3.5 billion for the 
Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant, which has historically failed to keep up 
with increases in the cost of providing substance use care to America’s neediest citizens. For the 
first time, the budget includes a 10 percent set aside for recovery support services, a critical step 
for  building and sustaining the nation’s recovery support services infrastructure. The Block 
Grant remains a critical source of funding for states, tribes, and territories to provide prevention, 
treatment, and recovery support services to their citizens.  The impact of this epidemic is felt in 
our communities, and the budget will direct funding to states and Tribes to increase community-
level response.  The budget will also increase access to medications for opioid use disorder and 
expand the behavioral health provider workforce, particularly in underserved areas.  I greatly 
appreciate the investments the American Rescue Plan Act provided to the Substance Abuse 
Prevention and Treatment Block Grant, Mental Health Block Grant, and Certified Community 
Behavioral Health Centers, and HHS will continue to build on these efforts.   
 
Promoting Biomedical Research 
 
HHS’ work is responsible for major scientific breakthroughs, and we are committed to 
supporting innovative science and research in order to advance the health and well-being of our 
nation.  As the world’s premier biomedical research agency, NIH will continue to be at the 
forefront of scientific advancements.  The budget includes $52 billion for NIH, a $9 billion 
increase or 21 percent increase over FY 2021 enacted.  Included in this increase is $6.5 billion to 
establish the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).  With an initial focus 
on cancer and other diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer’s, this major investment in Federal 
research and development will leverage ambitious ideas to build transformational platforms, 
capabilities, and resources to speed the application and implementation of health breakthroughs 
and shape the future of health and medicine in the U.S. 
   
8 
 
This bold new approach will complement NIH’s existing research portfolio, which is a vital 
contributor to longer and healthier lives, supports and trains world-class scientists, and drives 
economic growth.  Outside of ARPA-H, the remaining $2.5 billion increase will allow NIH to 
continue investing in basic research and translating research into clinical practice to address the 
most urgent challenges, such as HIV/AIDS and ending the opioid crisis. 
 
Restoring America’s Promise to Refugees 
 
HHS plays a critical role in promoting the wellbeing of those seeking refuge or relief in the U.S.  
The FY 2022 budget provides over $4.4 billion to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) – 
an increase of over $2.5 billion above FY 2021 enacted.  This funding would allow ORR to 
support an increase in the refugee admissions ceiling to 62,500 this fiscal year and to continue to 
rebuild the resettlement infrastructure in order to resettle up to 125,000 refugees in FY 2022.   
 
This funding increase also reflects a commitment to ensuring that unaccompanied children are 
provided with care and services that align with child welfare best practices while they are in 
ORR’s custody, and unified with relatives and sponsors as safely and quickly as possible.  
Despite significant challenges posed by COVID-19 and policies from the previous 
administration, HHS is humanely caring for unaccompanied children while working to unite 
them with a vetted sponsor.  Working across government and in close partnership with the 
Department of Homeland Security, we have substantially increased our ability to quickly 
facilitate the transfer of children out of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol custody and into child-
appropriate settings, including with fully vetted sponsors. 
 
Funding Core Program Operations 
 
It is simply not possible to meet the HHS mission and address all these key changes without 
sufficient funding to cover our operational needs.  The FY 2022 budget invests to bolster 
operations.  It strengthens administrative and operational resources throughout the Department 
needed to ensure proper stewardship of resources entrusted to HHS by Congress.   
 
Providing Oversight and Program Integrity 
 
Given the magnitude of HHS’s work—and the taxpayer dollars used to fund it—it is critical that 
we ensure that our funds are used appropriately.  The budget invests in program integrity, 
including efforts to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid, and Private 
Insurance.  
 
Conclusion 
 
I want to thank the Committee again for inviting me to discuss the President’s FY 2022 Budget 
for HHS, which offers a comprehensive fiscal vision for the nation that reinvests in America’s 
9 
 
health, supports future growth and prosperity, and meets U.S. commitments in a fiscally 
sustainable way.  I look forward to continuing to show how HHS helps fulfill that vision.

TESTIMONY OF  
MICHAEL S. REGAN 
 
ADMINISTRATOR 
U.S. ENVIRONEMNTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 
 
BEFORE THE 
U.S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES 
 
June 9, 2021 
 
Thank you, Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and members of the Subcommittee. 
I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency’s President’s Budget request for Fiscal Year 2022.  
 
Before I get to the FY 2022 President’s Budget request for the EPA, I would like to discuss the 
bold vision laid out by President Biden in the American Jobs Plan. This plan is a transformational 
investment that puts working people first and will help ensure we reduce pollution and help create 
good quality jobs. 
 
The American Jobs Plan 
In March, President Biden released the American Jobs Plan. This plan recognizes that now is the 
time for a bold, once-in-a-generation investment in America to put millions of people to work and 
lay the foundation for economic growth for decades to come by investing in infrastructure.  
Infrastructure in the 21st century extends far beyond just roads and bridges. It means investing in 
our  electrical  grid  and  building  more  resilient  transmission.  It  means  revitalizing  digital 
infrastructure to expand access to reliable, high-speed broadband internet in every pocket of the 
country, especially rural areas and underserved communities. And it also means investing in our 
drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, cleaning up and restoring our land, and investing in 
programs to reduce air pollution for our kids.  
Guaranteeing clean water for all 
The American Jobs Plan proposes a $111 billion investment in water infrastructure, including a 
$45 billion investment to replace 100% of lead service lines and pipes through the Environmental 
Protection Agency’s (EPA) Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and Water Infrastructure 
Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act grants. Replacing lead service lines is vital for public 
health and yet EPA estimates that six to 10 million homes in the United States and up to 400,000 
schools and daycare centers have lead service lines. The impact of lead exposure, including 
through drinking water, is a serious public health issue and its adverse effects on children are all 
too well known. In children, lead can cause irreversible and life-long health effects, including 
decreasing IQ, focus, and academic achievement.  
The plan also would invest $56 billion in grants and low-cost flexible loans to states, Tribes, 
territories,  and  disadvantaged  communities  across  the  country  to  upgrade  and  modernize 
1. 
 
America’s drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater systems, tackle new contaminants, and 
support clean water infrastructure across rural America. The American Jobs Plan also provides 
$10 billion in funding to monitor and remediate PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in 
drinking water and to invest in rural small water systems, and household well and wastewater 
systems, including drainage fields. Out of the $10 billion, EPA will receive $3.5 billion to dedicate 
toward PFAS in drinking water. 
In total, these investments will create millions of good paying jobs, including union jobs. 
We know from experience that water infrastructure investments not only improve public health—
they also create good-paying jobs. Through our State Revolving Funds, EPA has already provided 
more than $189 billion in financial assistance to nearly 43,000 water quality infrastructure projects 
and 16,500 drinking water projects. This has created over 300,000 jobs in the last two years alone. 
Through the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loan program, EPA has 
provided  $9  billion  in  credit  assistance  to  help  finance  more  than  $19  billion  for  water 
infrastructure while creating nearly 47,000 jobs and saving ratepayers $4 billion. 
 
Investing in clean buses for kids  
When I was a kid growing up in Eastern North Carolina I had to use an inhaler, an experience 
familiar for far too many kids. That is why the American Jobs Plan proposes to electrify at least 
20 percent of our yellow school bus fleet through a new Clean Buses for Kids Program at EPA. 
We know this type of investment works and that it is important to protect kids on their way to and 
from  school.  Since  2008,  Congress  has  provided  funding  through  EPA’s  Diesel  Emissions 
Reduction Act (DERA) for more than 28,000 school bus upgrades, including more than 4,000 
school bus replacements.  The Clean Buses for Kids Program is a new program, which would build 
on the lessons learned from DERA while leaving the existing program intact.   
 
Reducing emissions from school buses has demonstrated positive health benefits for the children 
who ride them, the drivers, people around school bus loading areas, and the communities in which 
they  operate.  These  investments  will  also  boost  market  demand  to  create  jobs,  build  out 
infrastructure and support U.S. manufacturing. 
 
Cleaning up and restoring our land 
In the 40 years since the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability 
Act (CERCLA) was signed into law, we have significant progress on cleaning up and restoring 
our land, but the work is far from over. Under my leadership, EPA will do everything in its power 
to  hold  bad  actors  accountable  for  environmental  degradation  and  return  land  to  safe  and 
productive use for communities. Communities located within one mile of Superfund sites are 
disproportionately  communities  of  color  and  low-income.  Remediation  of  these  sites  will 
strengthen climate resilience, improve public health, and expand job opportunities both in these 
communities, and the nation at large.  
 
The American Jobs Plan proposes a $5 billion investment in the remediation and redevelopment 
of Brownfield and Superfund sites, as well as related economic and workforce development 
programs. Cleaning up contaminated sites so they can be returned to productive use can be an 
engine for economic development across the country. Since Congress started the Brownfields 
2. 
 
program, federal investments have leveraged $34.6 billion, supported over 176,000 jobs, and 
thousands of properties have been cleaned up or made ready for reuse. 
 
The FY 2022 President’s Budget  
President Biden’s FY 2022 Budget for the Environmental Protection Agency of $11.2 billion 
advances key EPA priorities, including tackling the climate crisis, delivering environmental 
justice, and rebuilding core functions at the Agency. The FY 2022 President’s Budget request 
prioritizes working with and supporting state, local and Tribal leaders in expanding capacity in 
community development, cleaning up toxic waste, and investing in water infrastructure projects 
that create good paying jobs. The Budget request invests critical resources to restore scientific 
integrity at the Agency and ensuring the foundation of our decision-making process is grounded 
in science.     
 
Almost half of the FY 2022 Budget request, or $5.1 billion, is specifically allocated to EPA’s state 
and tribal partners through the State and Tribal Assistance Grant (STAG) appropriation. Within 
this amount, the FY 2022 request allocates $1.242 billion to support our state and tribal partners 
through categorical grants, which represents a $142 million increase above the FY 2021 enacted 
level. The Agency recognizes the important role federal assistance provides in protecting water 
bodies of special ecological and economic importance to our Nation. Through EPA’s Geographic 
Water programs, the Agency assists state and multi-state partners and tribes in managing and 
accelerating the restoration of the ecological health of these water bodies. In total, the FY 2022 
request provides an additional $36.4 million above the FY 2021 enacted level to increase funding 
for  all  Geographic  Water  programs  and  accelerate  projects  that  target  the  most  significant 
environmental problems in these important water bodies and watersheds. 
 
The EPA also is seeking additional resources and staff to enforce the environmental laws that 
Congress has passed so that all companies play on a level playing field and our communities share 
in public health benefits. 
 
Restoring the Agency 
Responding to the environmental crises at hand requires a systemic approach in expanding the 
Agency’s capacity. EPA lost nearly 1,000 dedicated staff over the past four years, and it has 
affected the Agency’s ability to carry out its core duties and functions to protect public health and 
the environment. The FY 2022 Budget serves as a critical inflection point to reverse the trend in 
recent years of a shrinking EPA workforce. Expanded capacity and growing the Agency is about 
achieving greater public health and environmental outcomes for the American people. EPA staff 
are  public  servants  and  include  the  front-line  scientists,  engineers,  analysts,  community 
coordinators, and program managers that implement EPA’s mission each and every day. Without 
increases in full-time equivalent (FTE) and resources across EPA programs, the Agency will 
struggle to meet the multiple environmental challenges facing the country today and in the future. 
The FY 2022 Budget supports 15,324 FTEs for EPA, an increase of more than 1,000 compared to 
the current level of 14,297. Critically, the FY 2022 Budget also includes the payroll to support 
both existing and new FTE.  
 
Restoring capacity across the Agency will strengthen our ability to tackle multiple priorities, from 
clean air and water, to cutting edge research at the Agency. Restoring the voice of our employees 
3. 
 
and supporting their efforts—through the best available science—to advance the mission of the 
Agency has never been more important.  
 
Tackling the climate crisis 
The FY 2022 President’s Budget reprioritizes addressing climate change with the urgency the 
science demands. The EPA’s recently relaunched Climate Change Indicators website presents 
compelling and clear evidence of changes to our climate reflected in rising temperatures, ocean 
acidity, sea level rise, river flooding, droughts, heat waves, and wildfires. The Budget includes an 
increase of $1.8 billion in programs to tackle the climate crisis while also delivering environmental 
justice to marginalized and over-burdened communities, investing in local economies, and creating 
good-paying jobs. We know that climate change is both a threat, and a remarkable opportunity to 
build a cleaner and healthier future that drives innovation and job creation. The FY 2022 Budget 
makes  investments  needed  for  EPA  and  its  partners  to  confront  the  urgent  environmental 
challenges  facing the country today, and for  all of America to  realize the return on these 
investments.    
 
For FY 2022, EPA requests a $100 million increase for air quality grants to states and tribes to 
help expand the efforts of air pollution control agencies to implement their programs and accelerate 
immediate on-the-ground efforts to reduce greenhouse gases.  
 
The FY 2022 Budget includes an additional $60 million to conduct research and deepen our 
knowledge  of  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on  human  health  and  the  environment.  This 
investment more than doubles EPA’s climate change research. Half of this increase will fund 
collaborative research in climate adaption and resilience with the new Advanced Research Projects 
Agency for Climate (ARPA-C) that will be located within the Department of Energy. The Budget 
also includes additional investments to decrease emissions of methane and hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and drive new markets, consistent with the recently 
enacted American Innovation in Manufacturing Act.  
 
Prioritizing environmental justice 
The communities hardest hit and struggling the most under the weight of the pandemic are often 
communities of color, lower income communities, and Tribal nations. For decades, many of these 
same communities have been overburdened with air pollution and other environmental hazards. 
An individual’s skin color or their zip code shouldn’t determine whether they have clean air to 
breathe and water to drink.  
 
The FY 2022 President’s Budget request invests over $930 million across the Agency towards a 
new  Accelerating  Environmental  and  Economic  Justice  Initiative  that  will  help  secure 
environmental justice for communities who too often have been left behind while creating jobs, 
cleaning up pollution, and implementing the Justice40 Initiative to advance racial equity. Like 
climate change, environmental justice underpins the work of the Agency and is an integral part of 
this national conversation surrounding equality and equity in the nation’s communities.  
 
The FY 2022 Budget makes historic investments in environmental justice programs to address the 
disproportionate health impacts of communities overburdened by pollution sources. The FY 2022 
Budget includes an increase of $287 million and 172 FTE for the Agency’s environmental justice 
4. 
 
program.  These  resources will provide new grant  opportunities for communities across the 
country. Further, to elevate environmental justice as a top agency priority, EPA proposes to create 
a new national environmental justice program office, headed by a Senate-confirmed Assistant 
Administrator, to coordinate and maximize the benefits of the agency’s programs and activities for 
underserved communities. We are working on the details of the proposal and look forward to close 
collaboration with the Committee.     
 
The environmental justice initiative invests in a new community air quality monitoring and 
notification  program,  provides  additional  funds  to  enforce  existing  laws  meant  to  protect 
communities from hazardous pollution, and allocates resources to hold polluters liable in civil and 
criminal suits. Every American deserves to know their exposure to air pollution. Toward that goal, 
and in concert with Section 222 of the Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home 
and  Abroad,  $100  million  will  support  development  and  implementation  of  a  community 
notification program to monitor and provide real-time data to the public on current environmental 
pollution. These investments build on the funds provided by the American Rescue Plan, which 
will help address disproportionate environmental or public health risks in minority and low-income 
populations resulting from exposure to pollution and the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 
American Rescue Plan 
I also want to acknowledge and thank Congress for recognizing EPA’s critical role in addressing 
human health and environmental disparities through the American Rescue Plan. Polluted air, 
contaminated water, and hazardous waste continue to threaten public health, and the COVID-19 
pandemic has compounded the seriousness of such inequities for communities for color and low-
income communities across the nation. The American Rescue Plan provides $100 million for the 
EPA to address these issues; $50 million targeted specifically to advance environmental justice 
and $50 million to help states, Tribes, and localities improve air quality for their communities. As 
we work to implement programs and projects to best maximize the use of this funding, I am 
focused on ensuring these vital funds have the highest and best impact on the ground.  
 
Conclusion 
In closing, I want to thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I look forward to our continued 
partnership and welcome any questions you may have.

DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY 
 
WRITTEN STATEMENT  
OF 
 
MR. JAIME A. PINKHAM 
ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE ARMY 
FOR CIVIL WORKS 
 
 
BEFORE  
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT 
UNITED STATES SENATE 
 
ON  
 
THE FISCAL YEAR 2022 BUDGET  
FOR THE CIVIL WORKS PROGRAM  
OF THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS 
 
9 June 2021 
 
 
 
1 
 
     Chairwoman Feinstein, Ranking Member Kennedy and distinguished members of 
the committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss the President’s 
Budget request for the Civil Works program of the Army Corps of Engineers. 
 
     The Fiscal Year 2022 Budget request provides roughly $6.8 billion for the Army Civil 
Works program, which is the highest annual budget ever proposed, with a focus on 
investments that will yield high economic and environmental returns, increasing 
resiliency to climate change; facilitating safe, reliable and sustainable commercial 
navigation; and accelerating and improving the delivery of water resources projects.  
This Budget relies on a foundation of strong relationships between the Corps and local 
communities, which allow us to work together to help develop, manage, restore, and 
protect the Nation’s water resources. 
 
     The Budget focuses on the highest performing work within the three main missions 
of the Army Civil Works program: 
 
•  commercial navigation,  
•  flood and storm damage reduction, and  
•  aquatic ecosystem restoration. 
 
     In developing the Budget, consideration was given to advancing two key objectives 
including: 1) increasing infrastructure and ecosystem resilience to climate change and 
decreasing climate risk for communities based on the best available science; and 2) 
promoting environmental justice in disadvantaged communities in line with Justice40 
and creating good paying jobs that provide the free and fair chance to join a union and 
collectively bargain. 
 
     The Budget supports a Corps program that has a diverse set of tools and 
approaches to working with local communities, whether this means funding projects with 
our cost-sharing partners, providing planning assistance and technical expertise to help 
communities make better risk-informed decisions, or participating in the national and 
international conversations on how to best address our water resources challenges.  
The Budget also focuses on maintaining the vast water resources infrastructure that the 
Corps owns and manages, and on finding innovative ways to rehabilitate it or transfer 
ownership to willing recipients.  For example, the Budget includes $13 million to 
complete six new major rehabilitation studies for inland waterways locks and dams and 
$2 million to investigate disposition of completed projects.  
 
     The FY 2022 Investigations account is funded at $106 million, the Construction 
account at $1.8 billion, the Operation and Maintenance account at $2.5 billion, the 
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund at $1.6 billion, the Inland Waterways Trust Fund at $52 
million, and the Mississippi River and Tributaries account at $270 million.  Other 
accounts include the Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies account at $35 million, 
the Regulatory Program account at $204.4 million, the Expenses account at $199.3 
million and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works account at 
$5 million.   
2 
 
 
The Army Corps will use $3.4 billion of these funds to invest in projects and 
activities that will facilitate commercial navigation, $1.7 billion to help reduce the risk of 
damages from floods and storms, and $501 million to restore aquatic ecosystems to a 
more natural condition.  These amounts include: 
 
•  $75 million to increase the resilience of Corps infrastructure to climate change, 
including $38 million for energy and water conservation measures at Corps 
projects, $23 million for updates to water control manuals at Corps projects that 
will account for a changing climate, $8 million for the charging infrastructure 
needed to support a Federal fleet of Zero Emission Vehicles, and $6 million to 
evaluate ways to increase the resilience of Corps infrastructure over the longer 
term; and 
 
•  $29 million for Corps technical and planning assistance programs, through which 
the Corps is able to enable states and local communities to take steps to reduce 
their flood risks including risks associated with climate change.  For example, the 
Budget supports Corps participation in joint Federal-State interagency teams 
known as the Silver Jackets, which work at the state level to help local 
communities to understand their flood risks and identify options to help them 
manage those risks, with emphasis on non-structural approaches. 
 
The American Jobs Plan also includes an additional $8 billion over five years for 
the Corps to improve ports and waterways. 
 
The Budget includes $350 million for the South Florida Everglades Restoration 
(SFER) program.  The SFER request of $350 million is a $100 million increase, or 40 
percent, to the 2021 enacted level.  SFER funding is also included in the American Jobs 
Plan.  Taken together, a robust amount of funding is proposed for SFER, enabling 
significant progress on this ecosystem restoration program. 
 
The FY 2022 Budget includes funding to initiate seven new studies – Central & 
Southern Florida Flood Resiliency (Section 216), FL; Boise River, Garden City, Ada 
County, ID; Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study, IL, IN, MI, MN, OH, PA, NY & WI; 
Spring Creek South, Jamaica Bay (Howard Beach), Queens, NY; Little Narragansett 
Bay, RI; Waccamaw River, Horry County, SC; and Little Goose Creek, Sheridan, WY.   
 
The FY 2022 Budget also includes funding to initiate construction at four new 
projects – McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, Three Rivers, AR; West 
Sacramento, CA; Anacostia Watershed Restoration, Prince George’s County, MD; and 
Norfolk Harbor and Channels, VA (Deepening) as well as to complete three construction 
projects – Calumet Harbor and River, IL & IN; Columbia River at the Mouth, OR/WA; 
and Anacostia Watershed Restoration, Prince George’s County, MD.   
 
Within the $1.6 billion proposed in the FY 2022 Budget to be derived from the 
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, $787 million would be used to support commercial 
3 
 
navigation at the top 50 U.S. coastal ports across the Nation, which handle around 90 
percent of the waterborne cargo that is shipped to or from the Unities States in foreign 
commerce; $252 million for operation and maintenance of Great Lakes projects; $58 
million for projects that support access by Native American tribes to their legally 
recognized historic fishing areas; and $63 million for five construction projects that will 
accommodate disposal of material dredged from coastal navigation projects.    
 
The FY 2022 Budget proposes $10 million for a new Innovative Funding 
Partnership program, which supports Corps efforts to accelerate and improve the 
delivery of water through greater non-Federal participation, and by removing barriers 
that prevent State, local, and private parties from moving forward with investments that 
they deem priorities.  In addition, the Budget also proposes to return responsibility for 
management of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) back 
to the Department of Energy (DOE).  Consolidation of FUSRAP with the other DOE 
cleanup programs under a single agency will allow DOE to consider a broader range of 
federal cleanup responsibilities in prioritizing work each fiscal year and result in 
efficiencies for taxpayers and the Army Corps would continue to perform cleanup of 
FUSRAP sites on a reimbursable basis with DOE. 
      
     The FY 2022 Budget begins the process of addressing the climate crisis. As outlined 
in Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, the Army 
will evaluate the Civil Works program to identify the appropriate actions the agency can 
take to support this policy objective in the FY 2023 Budget.  The Army is also committed 
to securing environmental justice and spurring economic opportunity for disadvantaged 
communities that have been historically marginalized and overburdened by pollution 
and experience underinvestment in essential services. The Army will actively work 
towards ensuring 40 percent of the benefits of climate and clean energy investments 
are directed to disadvantaged communities. These actions will include an examination 
of the activities of key programs to determine whether those programs’ benefits have 
accrued to disadvantaged communities. The Army will also begin to track program 
expenditures that impact disadvantaged communities and consider metrics that will help 
track how applicable covered program benefits accrue at specific disadvantaged 
communities. 
 
Finally, I would like to highlight one of the initiatives proposed in the Budget – an 
important technical change to the account structure of the Corps, which would improve 
our ability to oversee the spending financed through our two navigation trust funds.  
This proposal involves changes to the appropriations language for the Construction, 
Operation and Maintenance, and Mississippi River and Tributaries accounts, as well as 
the adoption of appropriations language for the Harbor Maintenance and Inland 
Waterways Trust Funds.  It is needed and would enable greater transparency and 
accountability in how these funds are budgeted and spent. 
 
I am very honored to have been selected for this position, to help implement the 
President's priorities for the Army Civil Works program.  I have been on-board for just a 
month or so.  And, I've had the opportunity to make two short trips — one to Tacoma 
4 
 
Harbor in Washington State, and another to multiple sites throughout West Virginia and 
northern Ohio.  I have been very impressed with the professionalism and dedication of 
the Corps of Engineers employees, who build and maintain water resources facilities for 
our primary Civil Works missions.  There is much work to be done, I'm excited to be a 
part of this great team — serving our Nation. 
 
Thank you all for inviting me here today.  I look forward to your questions.

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken 
Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request - State Department and Related Agencies 
United States Senate Committee on Appropriations 
June 8, 2021 
 
Chairman Leahy, Vice Chairman Shelby, Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, and all 
Committee members, thank you for this opportunity to talk about the Biden-Harris 
Administration’s proposed budget – and how it will help us achieve our national security 
priorities and deliver results for the American people.   
 
This is a critical moment for the United States and our global leadership. We face major tests, 
including stopping the COVID-19 pandemic, rising to the challenge of the climate crisis, and 
supporting a global economic recovery that delivers for American workers and families. We 
must revitalize our alliances and partnerships; out-compete China and defend the international 
rules-based order against those that seek to undermine it; renew democratic values at home and 
abroad; and push back against malign activity by our adversaries.  
 
In a more competitive world, other countries are making historic investments in their foreign 
policy toolkit. We must do the same. That’s why, in this budget, we’ve requested $58.5 billion 
for the State Department and USAID for Fiscal Year 2022.  
 
Here are some specifics.  
 
This budget will strengthen global health. The United States has been a leader in the field for 
decades, in Africa and around the world. We’re asking for $10 billion for global health 
programs, including nearly $1 billion for global health security, to help us prevent, prepare for, 
and respond to future global health crises so we can stop outbreaks before they turn into 
pandemics that put our safety and prosperity in danger. 
 
This budget will accelerate the global response to the climate crisis by providing $2.5 billion 
for international climate programs, including $1.25 billion to the Green Climate Fund, to help 
developing countries implement climate adaptation and emissions mitigation programs – which 
is directly in our own interest.  
  1 
It will double down on the fight for democracy, which is under threat in too many places. Our 
budget request includes $2.8 billion in foreign assistance to advance human rights, fight 
corruption, stem the tide of democratic backsliding, and strengthen and defend democracies – for 
example, through technical training for elections and support for independent media and civil 
society. It also requests $300 million for the National Endowment for Democracy.  
 
This budget will support a comprehensive strategy to address the root causes of irregular 
migration from Central America. It will invest $861 million in the region, as a first step 
toward a four-year commitment of $4 billion, to help prevent violence, reduce poverty, curtail 
endemic corruption, and expand job and educational opportunities.  
 
It will reestablish U.S. humanitarian leadership, with a request of $10 billion in assistance to 
support refugees, victims of conflict, and other displaced people, and to rebuild our refugees 
admissions program.  
 
It will support our partners in the Middle East by fully funding our commitments to key 
countries, including Israel and Jordan, and by restoring humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian 
people.  
 
It includes a budget request of $3.6 billion to pay our assessed contributions in full to 
international organizations, initiatives, and peacekeeping efforts, including to restore our 
annual contributions to the World Health Organization. As China and others work hard to bend 
international organizations to their worldview, we must ensure that these organizations instead 
remain grounded in the values, principles, and rules of the world that have made our shared 
progress possible for decades.  
 
Finally, to deliver in all these areas, this budget will reinvest in our most vital asset – our 
people. It will provide new resources to recruit, train, and retain a first-rate, diverse global 
workforce, with nearly 500 additional Foreign and Civil Service positions – the largest increase 
for State Department staffing in a decade. And it will modernize our technology and 
cybersecurity; protect our embassies and consulates; and include a direct appropriation of $320 
  2 
million for consular services worldwide, so we can continue to provide these vital services to 
Americans and those who seek to travel, study, or do business with the United States.  
 
Our national security depends not only on the strength of our armed forces but also our ability to 
conduct effective diplomacy and development. That’s how we solve global challenges, forge 
cooperation, advance our interests and values, protect our people, and prevent crises overseas 
from turning into emergencies at home. And that’s why diplomacy and development are smart 
investments for American taxpayers.  
 
A top priority for me as Secretary is to restore the traditional role of Congress as a partner in our 
foreign policy making. That’s the spirit I bring to today’s conversation, and I’m grateful for this 
chance to answer your questions.  
 
Thank you.

Statement of 
Gina M. Raimondo 
Secretary 
U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
Before the 
Senate Committee on Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies 
“Department of Commerce Fiscal Year 2022 Discretionary Request” 
May 26, 2021 
Chair Shaheen, Ranking Member Moran, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this 
opportunity to discuss President Biden’s Fiscal Year 2022 Discretionary Request for the 
U.S. Department of Commerce.  These priorities build upon the important investments you 
enacted in 2021 and I am grateful for your steadfast support of the Department. 
 
As you know, the Department of Commerce is responsible for promoting job creation, 
supporting and overseeing international trade, and providing economic, environmental, and 
scientific information needed by businesses, citizens, and governments.  President Biden’s 
Discretionary Request includes $11.4 billion for the Department of Commerce, a 28% increase 
above the 2021 enacted level.  With these funds we will maintain existing programs and 
activities and make critical investments necessary to boost the nation’s ability to address the 
crises we face today. 
 
This year’s appropriations process arrives during one of the most difficult periods in the nation’s 
history.  America faces four simultaneous crises of unprecedented scope: a once-in-a-century 
pandemic that has already claimed more than half a million American lives; a punishing 
economic crisis that has left nearly 10 million out of work; a national reckoning on racial 
inequity; and the increasing threat of climate change to the American people and economy.  The 
Department of Commerce has been providing critical assistance to confront and address each of 
these crises.  For example: 
 
•  The National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, researchers developed a 
way to increase the sensitivity and accuracy of the common swab test for COVID-19, 
improving our understanding of the pandemic; 
•  The Economic Development Administration, or EDA, has already awarded more than $1 
billion in grants to help communities and businesses across the country recover from the 
economic crisis and has another $3 billion in the pipeline; 
•  The Minority Business Development Agency, or MBDA, enabled technical assistance 
programs that helped minority business enterprises execute more than $7.9 billion in 
transactions in 2020 and has additional programs in the works this year; and 
•  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, continues to save 
lives and property by providing early warning systems and decision-support tools to 
avoid the most devastating impacts of extreme weather events, many of which are 
increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change. 
 
I am very proud of the work the dedicated career employees at the Department do every day to 
address these crises.  At the same time, I am also cognizant of the immense challenges that 
remain.  To fully address these challenges, we must boost strategic investments to support 
American manufacturing, spur research and technological innovation, advance economic 
recovery in underserved communities, invest in climate science and research, improve weather 
and climate forecasting, and strengthen American competitiveness and security. 
 
President Biden’s Discretionary Request puts forward investments that do just that.  I am 
confident that the request will address today’s crises and help American businesses create well- 
paying jobs for American workers, allow American businesses of all sizes to compete on an 
equal playing field, and empower a more equitable economy. 
 
I recognize that none of these investments or goals are possible without the support of the 
Congress and especially the members of this Committee.  I look forward to working with you all 
in the coming year to fund all of Commerce’s programs, and increase investments in the 
following key initiatives: 
 
Support American Manufacturing 
 
Manufacturing has long been the backbone of our country and we must strengthen our 
manufacturing to move America forward.  To ensure robust resurgence of American 
manufacturing and increase the security and resilience of our supply chain, the Discretionary 
Request more than doubles funding for the Department’s most effective manufacturing 
programs: the Manufacturing Innovation Institutes Program (MII) and the Manufacturing 
Extension Partnership (MEP). 
 
A Manufacturing Innovation Institute is a public-private partnership of companies, academia, state 
and local governments, and federal agencies that co-invest in developing world-leading 
technologies and capabilities.  The Discretionary Request calls for an additional $150 million for 
two new MIIs, one of which will help restore the United States as the global leader in the design 
and manufacture of semiconductors.  It also calls for an additional $125 million for MEP.  The 
MEP National Network consists of 51 MEP Centers located in all 50 states and Puerto Rico.  The 
additional funds will enable them to strengthen domestic supply chains and help small and 
medium manufacturers improve their competitiveness. 
 
Spur Research and Technological Innovation 
 
Public investments in research and development lay the foundation for future breakthroughs that 
generate new businesses, jobs, and exportable goods.  The Discretionary Request calls for $916 
million, an increase of $128 million over the 2021 enacted level, to expand scientific and 
technological research at NIST.  With this investment, NIST will spur research advances in 
climate-resilient building codes, computing, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, quantum 
information science, biotechnology, and advanced manufacturing. 
  2 
U.S. leadership in advanced communications requires commercial operators to have access to a full 
array of spectrum bands to share with federal agencies.  This Discretionary Request includes 
$39 million for advanced communications research at the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration, or NTIA, to support the development and deployment of broadband 
and 5G technologies, by identifying innovative approaches to spectrum sharing, including 
research using the Federal Advanced Communications Test Site (FACTS) at NTIA’s Table 
Mountain field site in Boulder, Colorado. 
Advance Economic Recovery in Underserved Communities 
Every American should have an equal chance to pursue their potential.  Yet, for far too many 
Americans, this has never been within reach.  The President’s 2022 Discretionary Request calls 
for $70 million for MBDA to expand opportunities for minority-owned businesses and help 
eliminate barriers for minority-owned firms.  The request also will elevate MBDA’s position 
within the Department of Commerce and establish an Assistant Secretary for MBDA. 
 
The Discretionary Request also will prioritize creating good jobs by revitalizing former energy 
communities.  To spur economic revitalization and support energy workers, the request includes 
$84 million, an increase of $50 million over the 2021 enacted level, for EDA’s Assistance to 
Coal Communities Program.  These funds will help ensure that communities most impacted by 
the transition to clean energy are not left behind.  EDA’s efforts are part of the POWER+ 
Initiative and complement other targeted investments across the Federal Government. 
 
The Discretionary Request also includes $300 million for EDA to support locally driven 
economic development projects in communities across the nation.  These investments will enable 
local communities to establish a foundation for sustainable job growth, and build durable regional 
economies by funding projects that advance equity, support workforce education and skills 
training, enable business expansion and technology updates, support growth in exports and 
foreign direct investment, and address the climate crisis. 
 
Invest in Climate Science and Research 
 
Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time.  Yet it is also an opportunity for 
economic growth and innovation.  In the Discretionary Request, the Administration proposes a 
whole of government approach to address this challenge and harness this opportunity.  NOAA 
climate science provides the data, tools, and information that are the foundation for both efforts. 
The Discretionary Request therefore includes $800 million for NOAA to expand climate 
observation, forecasting, and research so that NOAA can provide better data, information and 
tools to federal agencies, states, Tribes, communities, and businesses across America to enable 
smart policy and decision-making.  This investment will also improve community and coastal 
resilience by investing in modern infrastructure and funding competitive grants to help protect 
communities from the costly economic and environmental impacts of severe weather events and 
climate change.  The increased resources will also support an expanded and improved drought 
early warning system. 
  3 
Improve Weather and Climate Forecasting 
 
Families, businesses, and state and local governments rely on NOAA’s weather satellites and 
forecasts every day.  When severe weather strikes, these forecasts can literally mean the 
difference between life and death in impacted communities.  The Discretionary Request invests 
$2 billion, approximately $500 million more than the 2021 enacted level, in the next generation 
of satellites.  With these additional resources, NOAA will be able to enhance its world-leading 
satellite observing systems by incorporating a diverse array of new technologies to improve data 
for weather and climate forecasts and provide critical information to the public.  This data will 
allow for more informed decision-making that protects life and property, safeguards the 
economy, and supports the fight against climate change. 
 
Strengthen American Competitiveness and Security 
 
American businesses and workers can compete if we all play by the same rules.  The 2022 
Discretionary Request ensures Commerce’s International Trade Administration has staff and 
resources it needs to defend U.S. workers by addressing unfair foreign trade practices and 
barriers, strengthening enforcement of U.S. trade laws, and enhancing oversight of foreign 
government compliance with trade agreements.  It also provides additional staff and resources 
for the Bureau of Industry and Security to analyze export control and Entity List proposals, 
enforce related actions, and implement export controls. 
 
*** 
 
I look forward to working with you to create an economy that works for all by creating jobs and 
growth that support American communities, businesses, and workers – now and in the future.  I 
am happy to take your questions.

SECRETARY 
 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
 
REGARDING A HEARING ON 
 
“THE FY 2022 DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY BUDGET” 
 
BEFORE THE 
 
UNITED STATES SENATE 
 
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS  
 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY 
 
May 26, 2021 
Washington, D.C. 
 
   
 
Chairman Murphy, Ranking Member Capito, and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee: 
 
It is a privilege to appear before you today to discuss the Department of Homeland Security’s 
Fiscal Year 2022 Budget.   
         
On a daily basis, the more than 240,000 men and women of DHS respond to our Nation’s most 
serious threats.  DHS employees rise to every challenge, and the challenges are many.  DHS is 
aggressively pursuing the Administration’s priorities and addressing some of the most critical 
and evolving threats to the United States. We are focusing on defeating the COVID-19 
pandemic, advancing technology for border security while promoting a humane and efficient 
immigration system, combatting Domestic Violent Extremism (DVE), and detecting, deterring, 
and recovering from malicious cyber-attacks.  While I am unable to address the details of the 
Budget until it is officially released, I would like to highlight the work we have undertaken so far 
at DHS under the Biden-Harris Administration, as well as the priorities included in the FY 2022 
President’s Budget.  
 
Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic 
 
COVID-19 has impacted every facet of the American way of life, and DHS has been integral to 
the effort to successfully and equitably distribute COVID-19 vaccinations across the country. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency helped vaccinate more than 5 million people at 
our community vaccination sites and remains committed to assisting government and nonprofit 
partners to help defeat this deadly pandemic.  FEMA helped stand up over 1,000 federally-
supported community vaccination centers.  FEMA has provided more than $4.6 billion in 
support of vaccinations across the country.   
 
As Secretary, I have no greater obligation than that of ensuring the health and safety of our 
workforce, 80 percent of whom are frontline or public-facing employees.  Five days into the 
Biden-Harris Administration, DHS launched Operation Vaccinate Our Workforce (VOW) to 
accelerate the administration of COVID-19 vaccines on a voluntary basis to frontline and public-
facing DHS employees.  On the first day of the Biden-Harris Administration, less than two 
percent of our frontline workforce who elected to receive the vaccine had been vaccinated.  
Today, that share has grown to more than 77 percent.  Prioritizing the health and safety needs of 
the DHS workforce has enabled us to fulfill our mission even in a constrained COVID-19 
environment.  Operation VOW partnered with the Veterans Health Administration, a world-class 
healthcare system, to get COVID-19 vaccines into the arms of our frontline personnel. 
 
Our public health and medical professionals from the Chief Medical Officer’s staff participated 
in the whole of government approach to combat the pandemic by serving on the Federal 
Healthcare Resilience Task Force, the Medical Countermeasures (MCM) Task Force, and 
deploying as part of a tactical medical assistance team.  These efforts resulted in life-saving 
Personal Protective Equipment preservation best practices, the accelerated development, 
manufacture, and availability of COVID-19 MCMs, and the implementation of novel clinical and 
operational interventions that saved lives in diverse communities across the Nation. 
 
Addressing the Challenges at the Border 
2 
 
 
 
Since April 2020, the number of encounters at the border has been rising due to ongoing 
violence, natural disasters, food insecurity, and poverty in the Northern Triangle countries of 
Central America.  This resulted in a substantial strain on the processing, transportation, and 
holding capacity of the U.S. Border Patrol.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
recommended temporary holding capacity within all Border Patrol facilities had also been 
reduced by 75% to allow for increased physical distancing and to reduce the further spread of the 
disease.  Compounding this challenge is the fact that the previous administration dismantled our 
Nation’s immigration system, terminated the Central American Minors program, and cut 
hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid to the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El 
Salvador, and Honduras.  As a result, the recent surge in unaccompanied children presented a 
serious challenge for DHS and our colleagues at the Department of Health and Human Services.   
 
On March 13, I directed FEMA to support a government-wide effort to safely receive, shelter, 
and transfer unaccompanied children to HHS care and custody and onward to a verified sponsor.  
FEMA immediately integrated and co-located with HHS to look at every available option to 
support a quick expansion of HHS’s physical capacity for the care and custody of 
unaccompanied children, and to support HHS in managing overall operations.  FEMA has 
deployed more than 100 employees to help HHS identify locations for emergency shelters, 
oversee construction, and manage operations.    
 
Additionally, U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS) has trained and deployed more 
than 350 of its personnel to virtually interview unaccompanied children and potential sponsors, 
in order to provide case management for unaccompanied children in HHS custody at Emergency 
Intake Sites (EIS).  As of May 4, 2021, USCIS personnel have conducted nearly 4,000 
interviews and recommended more than 2,200 children for release to a sponsor.  CBP also 
constructed additional soft-sided facilities and stood up the interagency Movement Coordination 
Cell (MCC) to bring together colleagues from FEMA, HHS, U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE), and CBP to share a common operating picture.  More than 400 additional 
DHS volunteers stepped up to help through the DHS Volunteer Force.   
 
Between March 13 and May 1, FEMA assisted in the activation of fourteen HHS EIS facilities.  
EIS facilities are operating in Texas, California, and Michigan, increasing the potential 
temporary bed capacity when fully staffed by 19,987 beds, or 1,999 percent.    
 
This additional bed capacity, along with improvements in the process of safely releasing 
unaccompanied children to sponsors, has resulted in the reduction of the total number of 
unaccompanied children in CBP custody from 5,767 at its peak on March 29th to 455 on May 
11th.  During this same period, the number of unaccompanied children who have been in custody 
longer than 72 hours has decreased from 4,078 at its peak on March 29th to zero on the morning 
of May 11th, while average time in custody for unaccompanied children has fallen from 133 
hours on March 29th to 22 hours on the morning of May 11th.  This progress occurred while CBP 
encountered 18,000 unaccompanied children in the month of April.  For the seven-day period 
ending May 10th, CBP transferred an average of 422 unaccompanied children per day to ORR, 
approximately two-thirds of CBP’s total unaccompanied child population on a given day and 
more than keeping pace with daily apprehensions.   
3 
 
 
    
Stopping the Threat of Domestic Violent Extremism 
 
As threats against the Nation evolve, it is critical that the Department adapts quickly and 
efficiently when necessary to meet any threat against the people of the United States.  
Domestic violent extremism is typically fueled by false narratives, conspiracy theories, and 
extremist rhetoric usually spread through social media and other online platforms.  The lethality 
of this threat is all too real, as witnessed during the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 
and recent attacks across the United States, including against government buildings, personnel, 
and minority groups. DHS is prioritizing addressing this threat while improving the quality of 
our intelligence gathering and analysis, information sharing, and DVE detection, prevention, and 
response efforts. 
 
Combatting this violence requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach, which 
I have already initiated at DHS in collaboration with key partners, including the Department of 
Justice, to help ensure the violence and assault on democracy that occurred on January 6th does 
not occur again.  DHS has established a new, dedicated domestic terrorism branch within the 
Department’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and recently established a new Center for 
Prevention Programs and Partnerships, replacing the Office for Targeted Violence and Terrorism 
Prevention.  Further, DHS is increasing training opportunities for law enforcement partners, 
including through threat assessment and management programs related to domestic violent 
extremism.  DHS also announced an internal review of the potential threat of DVE within the 
Department. 
 
In February, I designated, for the first time, combatting domestic violent extremism as a 
“National Priority Area” for the FY 2021 State Homeland Security Program and Urban Area 
Security Initiative grant programs.  As a result, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments are 
required to spend 7.5 percent of their DHS grant awards combating this threat.  On March 24, the 
Department made $20 million available through the Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention 
Grant Program to help communities across our country develop innovative capabilities to combat 
terrorism and targeted violence. 
 
Bolstering Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure 
 
Our Nation faces constant cyber threats from nation states and criminal groups alike. Earlier this 
month, the United States suffered a significant ransomware attack against its critical 
infrastructure.  Over the past months, we discovered several intrusion campaigns impacting the 
federal government.  As the Nation’s lead agency for protecting the federal civilian government 
network and critical infrastructure against cybersecurity threats, the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) serves a central role by enabling greater visibility into 
cybersecurity threats, strengthening incident response capabilities, and driving improvements in 
security practices.  Congress recently empowered and further strengthened CISA through several 
provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act that the Department is now focused on 
implementing. 
 
On May 12, President Biden issued an Executive Order to bolster our Nation’s cybersecurity and 
4 
 
 
protect federal government networks.  This Order will empower DHS and our interagency 
partners to modernize federal cybersecurity, expand information sharing, and dramatically 
improve our ability to prevent, detect, assess, and remediate cyber incidents.  We are actively 
working to implement the Executive Order to help agencies improve their security posture, 
develop a standard playbook for incident response, and establish a Cyber Safety Review Board 
comprised of public and private sector stakeholders.   
 
In addition to the NDAA and the Executive Order, I announced a series of 60-day “sprints” to 
mobilize action across the Department focusing on specific priority areas.  The first sprint is 
dedicated to the fight against ransomware, a particularly egregious type of malicious cyber 
activity that usually does not discriminate whom it targets.  The second is dedicated to building a 
more robust and diverse workforce at the Department and beyond.  We are currently in the midst 
of advancing these sprints before we will turn to better protecting industrial control systems, 
cybersecurity in the context of our transportation systems, and our election infrastructure. 
 
Funding Priorities for FY 2022 
 
As the Department supports the priorities of the new Administration, we recognize the 
opportunities to partner with Congress in a variety of efforts, both foreign and domestic, to take 
DHS into the future.  Focusing on advanced technology for border security, promoting an 
orderly, safe, and humane immigration system, enhancing privacy and civil rights protections, 
and supporting Federal, State, local, and private entities’ efforts to detect, deter, and recover 
from malicious cyber-attacks, these priorities directly impact the security and safety of 
Americans.  The FY 2022 President’s Budget will ensure that we have the tools we need to meet 
our mission.    
 
While I am unable to address the specific DHS items for the FY 2022 President’s Budget, I 
would like to highlight the Administration’s priorities that were included in the recent 
discretionary request.  The President’s FY 2022 discretionary request provides $52.2 billion for 
DHS, approximately equal to the FY 2021 enacted level. 
  
The discretionary request provides approximately $1.2 billion for border infrastructure that 
includes construction and modernization of land Ports of Entry; investments in modern border 
security technology and assets; and, efforts to ensure the safe, orderly, and humane treatment of 
migrants in CBP custody.  These investments would facilitate security screening to combat 
human smuggling and trafficking, the movement of illicit drugs and weapons, as well as provide 
for the more efficient processing of legal trade, travel, and commerce through the Nation’s Ports 
of Entry.  In addition, the request includes no new funding for border wall construction and 
proposes the cancellation of prior-year wall construction balances that are unobligated when 
Congress takes action on the FY 2022 request. 
 
The FY 2022 request supports the promise of a fair and equitable immigration system that 
enforces our immigration laws and reflects the Nation’s values.  U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Services identified $345 million in the discretionary request to address 
naturalization, asylum, and other program backlogs, supporting up to 125,000 refugee 
admissions in 2022, and addressing systems and operations modernization.  In addition, U.S. 
5 
 
 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement will expand access to the Alternatives to Detention 
program and provides enhanced case management services, particularly for families seeking 
asylum.  
 
Along with the ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the discretionary request expands 
DHS’s work with State and local communities to prepare for the impacts of climate change.  The 
discretionary request invests an additional $540 million above the 2021 enacted level to 
incorporate climate impacts into pre-disaster planning and resilience efforts.  This funding level 
also supports a resilient infrastructure community grant program, which prioritizes climate 
resilience projects for vulnerable and historically underserved communities.  In addition, the 
discretionary request continues investments in the incident response workforce to ensure 
sufficient personnel are trained and available for deployment to help communities respond to 
future disasters.  The discretionary request would also increase the number of FEMA staff 
equipped to support communities in order to prepare and respond to disasters in an equitable 
manner. 
 
The discretionary request provides a total of $131 million to support diverse, innovative, and 
community-driven methods to prevent domestic terrorism while respecting privacy, civil rights, 
and civil liberties.  This funding builds on the 2021 enacted level, while supporting critical 
research on the root causes of radicalization and enhanced community outreach.  The request 
includes $20 million for grants to build local capacity to prevent targeted violence and all forms 
of terrorism, in addition to approximately $75 million available under the FEMA Homeland 
Security Grant Program.   
 
The discretionary request addresses, in a variety of ways, the challenges and potential threats 
identified by recent cybersecurity incidents.  The discretionary request provides $2.1 billion for 
CISA, which builds on the $650 million provided for CISA in the American Rescue Plan Act of 
2021.  This funding would allow CISA to enhance its cybersecurity tools, hire highly qualified 
experts, and obtain support services to protect and defend Federal information technology 
systems.  The discretionary request also proposes $618 million for investments in research, 
development, and innovation across the Department, to lay a strong and relevant foundation for 
securing the American public from future threats.  These projects focus on climate resilience, 
cybersecurity data analytics, and transportation security technologies while building on existing 
infrastructure throughout the Department. 
 
I am honored to support and represent the dedicated DHS workforce.  Their commitment to the 
dynamic homeland security mission is unwavering, and I vow to do everything in my authority 
as Secretary to ensure they are resourced, compensated, and recognized appropriately.   
Therefore, I ask for your continued support in providing the resources we need to meet our 
mission. 
 
I look forward to discussing the FY 2022 President’s Budget in greater detail when it is officially 
released, and I welcome any questions that you have at this time.

Statement of Victoria Christiansen, Chief of the USDA Forest Service 
Before the XX Committee XX 
Concerning President’s Fiscal Year 2022 Proposed Budget 
For the USDA Forest Service 
      April XX, 2021, XX:XX a.m. 
  
Chair X, Ranking Member X, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here 
today to testify on the President’s fiscal year 2022 Budget for the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA), Forest Service.  
 
Over the past year, the coronavirus pandemic brought human loss and suffering to untold numbers 
of American families. Job losses, challenges with social distancing, separation of loved ones, 
telework, and virtual schooling, all impacted our society and agency workforce.  In response, the 
Forest Service found new and imaginative ways of performing our mission-critical work, including 
suppressing wildfire with minimal risk of spreading the coronavirus (COVID-19); safely working 
with partners to improve forest conditions; and hosting unprecedented numbers of visitors on the 
National Forest System, enabling them to safely enjoy their public lands.  All while keeping fiscal 
accountability and employee well-being as a foundation for our work. 
 
Given the challenges of the pandemic, we were able to complete and sustain forest treatment work 
on the ground.  The Forest Service continued its focus to improve forest conditions to reduce 
wildfire risk to communities on over 2.65 million acres.  These actions included removing 
hazardous fuels like dead and downed trees, and combating disease, insect and invasive species 
infestations. We also improved more than 443,400 acres through watershed restoration, with many 
of these projects designed to improve climate resiliency, improve passage for aquatic wildlife, or 
protect sources of drinking water on National Forest System lands.  The Forest Service moved nine 
watersheds to an improved condition by completing all the essential projects in the respective 
Watershed Restoration Action Plans. The Forest Service also focused on providing jobs and 
stability for local economies through a year of historic timber production, selling more than 3.2 
billion board feet of timber, the second highest level in 20 years. 
In fiscal year 2021, we have treated nearly 1.1 million acres to reduce wildfire risk and improve 
forest conditions.  We have had great success in implementing prescribed fire projects thus far , 
and the agency is on track to meet the goal of 3.5 million acres treated by the end of the fiscal year. 
These prescribed burns are low-intensity surface fires that release substantially less carbon dioxide 
than wildfires of the same size. 
The Forest Service is doing its part to support jobs and aid the economic stability of communities 
and municipalities where citizens have suffered significant economic downturns resulting from the 
ongoing pandemic. Specifically, the Forest Service has invested CARES ACT funding to create and 
sustain jobs in rural communities, including opportunities for university STEM students, hiring field 
crews and increasing funding in contracts and agreements with States to hire field crews to conduct 
catch-up surveys of Forest Inventory and plots. Plot surveys fell behind in fiscal year 2020 because 
of extreme wildfires in the West and because of the pandemic. This additional investment alone 
created more than 50 jobs. Moreover, the Forest Inventory and Analysis program's data and 
1 
 
analyses provide essential information to industry to inform mill location and to guide business 
planning in the forest products sector by monitoring and projecting wood volume and supply. This 
enhances the viability and profitability of the entire sector, directly affecting tens of thousands of 
jobs. Over 900 timber sale contracts have been extended, providing additional time for purchasers 
to harvest timber. 
We are also working to sustain rural small businesses and industries by relying on local 
communities to fulfill logistical firefighting personnel needs rather than outsource to larger cities, 
keeping communities open by supporting lodging, restaurants, grocery stores, and hardware 
suppliers.  
In a year where demand for outdoor recreation reached record levels during the pandemic, we 
expect a modest rise in spending from $9.5 billion in 2019 to just under $10 billion in 2020 and 
economic contributions to the Gross Domestic Product to rise from $11.4 billion to ~$12 billion 
with over 148,000 jobs supported.  We have helped families that depend on firewood to meet both 
heating and cooking needs by issuing free firewood permits in times of public disaster or 
emergencies to assist those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
I will now discuss how our ongoing work to implement the fiscal year 2021 budget aligns with the 
Biden Administration’s priorities for fiscal year 2022, including helping to control the COVID-19 
pandemic; tackle climate change; provide economic relief through job creation; advance racial 
equity; and further improve our work environment.  
Controlling the COVID-19 pandemic 
Last year, despite the coronavirus pandemic as well as historic natural disasters and civil unrest, the 
Forest Service rose to the challenge. Our responsibility as an employer, a service provider to the 
public, and a manager of federal recreation sites, is to ensure the safety of our employees, 
contractors, and the public. This is our top priority. That is why agency policy requires our 
employees, contractors and visitors to wear a mask, maintain physical distance, and have access to 
essential Personal Protective Equipment.  
 
Our 2021 field work and fire seasons are currently underway. In accordance with the 
Administration’s priority in Executive Order 13987 to halt the spread of COVID-19, by relying on 
the best available data and science-based public health measures, the Forest Service will continue to 
follow guidance in USDA’s Workplace Safety Plan This Plan is a detailed, data-driven COVID-19 
workplace safety plan that prioritizes the health and safety of our federal employees and 
contractors—whether they work in offices or out in the field.  National Forests are evaluating local 
conditions and mitigating risks ahead of reopening more visitor centers, recreation sites and other 
public venues. We are working to continue the successes achieved last year in wildfire suppression 
response in maintaining the safety of our employees, contractors and partners in shared quarters and 
fire camps. 
 
Tackling Climate Change 
Today, the need to address the climate crisis is more urgent than ever. Fire seasons are longer with 
wildfires occurring outside the span of historic fire seasons in different parts of the country. Other 
climate change threats include regional drought, invasive species, and major outbreaks of insects 
2 
 
and disease.  The Forest Service stands ready to meet these challenges and advance the 
Administration’s climate goals. These challenges include researching the vulnerability of water 
supplies and watersheds to a changing climate; conducting assessments and providing tools such as 
the National Insects and Disease Risk Map; and identifying optimal fuel treatment practices and 
accelerating the pace and scale of prescribed fire.  
 
Wildfire Management. The 2020 fire year was unprecedented in many ways. Not only did we fight 
fire during a global pandemic, but more acres burned on Forest Service-managed lands than in any 
previous year since the historic Big Burn of 1910.  The increased frequency of wildfires in the 
wildland-urban interface continues to impact more homes and communities than ever before, with 
more acres burned in California than in any previous year on record. In 2020, wildfires destroyed 
nearly 18,000 homes and outbuildings (structures).  
 
In 2021, we are anticipating and are prepared for another long and arduous fire year. We continue to 
invest in pre-planned response using risk assessments and analytics to inform fire managers about 
resource allocations needed and used on fires. We are also investing in several key technology and 
modernization portfolios; including, Data Management, Enhanced Real Time Operating Picture, 
Decision Support Applications, and Modern Tools for a Modern Response. Additionally, 
implementation of the Large Fire Assessment process, as directed by the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2021 Omnibus), is helping us better account for our actions 
while fostering a learning culture. Cooperation with partners at the federal, state, and local levels 
also ensures we have a strong workforce of firefighters and equipment to provide for safe and 
effective wildfire response throughout the year.  
 
Climate Adaptation and Mitigation. In line with Executive Order (E.O.) 14008, Tackling the 
Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, the Forest Service is using science to advance climate-smart 
land management, restoration, fire management, and science innovation and delivery for the benefit 
of current and future generations. We are building on past work by leading USDA’s Climate Hubs. 
These Hubs provide practical, proactive tools informed by science for landowners and land 
managers. Maintaining climate-resilient landscapes is central to virtually all Forest Service research 
and land management activities and goals. For example, we are implementing acquisition of 
conservation easements on private lands and increasing capacity for carbon sequestration through 
reforestation and production of woody biomass for forest products. All these activities are 
furthering the goals of E.O. 14008 to conserve 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.  We are 
also coordinating with the Department of the Interior to support a strategy for creating a Civilian 
Climate Corps, drawing on the agency’s unique expertise and history that builds on the legacy of 
the New Deal Civilian Conservation Corps. Through the Climate Conservation Corps, we will work 
to deliver forest and watershed health and resilience, carbon sequestration, wildfire risk reduction, 
innovation in science and science delivery, and improvements in sustainable operating 
infrastructure. In addition, a Civilian Climate Corps will provide career opportunities for a diverse 
generation of Americans in critical work to promote environmental sustainability.  
 
Restoration and Reforestation. Natural resource challenges are best met with collective action. 
Stakeholders of the Forest Service broadly agree on the need for active measures to address the 
threats across many of the landscapes we manage. Congress is doing their part as well.  The Forest 
Service has plans for the reforestation of over 1.3 million acres of National Forest System 
3 
 
land.  These plans address only one third of National Forest System reforestation needs, which are 
estimated at 4 million acres.  Wildfires create over 80 percent of reforestation needs, including 
approximately 1 million acres from the 2020 wildfire season. The Forest Service is also placing 
special emphasis on planting the right species, in the right place, under the right conditions, so 
forests will remain healthy over time.  
Moving forward we will maintain our Shared Stewardship approach of working together in an 
integrated way to make decisions and take actions on the land. With this shared approach, the Forest 
Service is working more closely than ever with states, tribes, and other partners on priority projects 
across landscapes and across all land ownerships. We are sharing decisions and risks and achieving 
measurable outcomes that we mutually define.  This strategy is dependent on our employees—our 
largest and most important investment. The successful delivery of services and work starts with a 
highly skilled, motivated workforce. They are essential to confronting the climate-related challenges 
facing America’s forests and grasslands; they are integral to the services and experiences we offer 
to citizens, local communities, and our partners.  
 
The Administration has also placed a priority to restore nature-based infrastructure including our 
lands, forests, wetlands, watersheds, and other natural resources. As part of the American Jobs Plan, 
the Administration is calling on Congress to invest in protection from extreme wildfires and the 
restoration of major water and land resources. To accomplish this, the plan empowers local leaders 
to shape these restoration and resilience project funds in line with the Outdoor Restoration Force 
Act. 
 
Providing Economic Relief 
The fiscal year 2021 Omnibus authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to use up to $200 million to 
provide financial relief to timber harvesting and timber hauling businesses that have experienced 
financial losses due to COVID-19. Timber harvesters and haulers are critical to forest management 
across the country. COVID-19 relief assistance is a top priority of the Biden Administration, and 
Forest Service staff are coordinating with USDA Farm Services Agency staff to  implement this 
provision and get financial assistance to timber harvesting and hauling businesses as soon as 
possible. 
 
The Forest Service will also make positive impacts on state and local economies thanks to the 
innovative authorities Congress provided in the recently enacted Great American Outdoors Act. 
This significant legislation will enable us to repair and upgrade vital infrastructure and facilities in 
our national forests, and permanently funds the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), 
investing in conservation and recreation opportunities on public and private lands. Projects will 
enrich the lives of current and future generations by improving landscape resiliency and increasing 
access. Recent investments in these areas are an indication of Congress’ expectations and trust in us, 
and I look forward to continuing to work with you to meet those expectations and trust. There is 
much more work to be done, and we are committed to doing the right work in the right places at the 
right scale. 
 
Fiscal Accountability and the Fire Funding Fix 
In fiscal year 2021, the Forest Service has transitioned to a new budget structure that will help us 
increase transparency of our spending over time.  It also will result in enhanced budget discipline, 
such as better planning to fund fixed costs and help overcome longstanding systemic challenges 
4 
 
without negative impacts to programs that benefit the public. We are experiencing some growing 
pains and learning from them.  Realignment of the budget structure is illuminating the need for 
changes to some of our business and cultural practices. We are stewarding the Forest Service 
through this change with strategic workforce planning and collaboratively managing all operations 
within our allocated budgets. This requires making difficult decisions and strengthening internal 
control to mitigate overspending.  
 
At the beginning of fiscal year 2021, fire activity was at its peak with most resources committed 
throughout the country. In prior years the end of the most severe part of the fire season typically 
occurred in early to mid-September.  This year, however, there were more than 24,000 firefighters 
engaged nationally on October 1, at the start of the new fiscal year, which is substantially more than 
the early October average of approximately 3,600.  Pushing the severe part of the fire season more 
than a month later into fiscal year 2021 shifted the high spend rate the agency typically incurs in 
August and September into October and November.  As a result, the agency transferred $1.8 billion 
from the Wildfire Suppression Operations Reserve Fund (Fire Funding Fix), to fund wildfire 
suppression operations in fiscal year 2021. We understand congressional expectations for increasing 
accountability and oversight of fire spending that come with the Fire Funding Fix. We will continue 
to closely monitor and report on the status of spending to ensure judicious use of suppression funds 
during the fiscal year.   
 
Advancing Racial Equity and Improving Our Work Environment 
It is essential that we create a work environment that promotes the safety of our employees and 
fosters equity and inclusion for all people. USDA is committed to ensuring equity across its 
agencies, removing barriers to access, and building a workforce more representative of America.  
To that end, the Forest Service strives to maintain a work environment that is equitable, respectful, 
and free of harassment and bullying of any kind. The Forest Service has taken significant steps to 
improve policies, raise accountability, upgrade reporting systems, and conduct training focused on 
workplace environment to stop harassment, bullying, and retaliation. We are working to 
permanently change our culture. I am committed to ending discrimination in all its forms wherever 
it exists. The Forest Service is continuing the hard work that creates the work place our employees 
deserve and building an organization where every individual, inside and out of the agency, is treated 
with respect and dignity.  
 
In closing, we are always mindful of the need to demonstrate to Congress and the public we are 
striving to do our part to spend taxpayer dollars as they are intended - to address the serious 
challenges facing our land managing mission today. The President’s fiscal year 2022 Budget 
request for the Forest Service will position us to fulfill our mission and invest in the 
Administration’s immediate priorities. I look forward to working with this Subcommittee to fulfill 
the President’s goals and our key responsibilities for the long-term benefit of the Nation’s forests 
and grasslands, and for all Americans. I welcome your questions.

Introduction 
 
Chairman Heinrich, Ranking Member Boozman, and distinguished members of the 
subcommittee: Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you on the important topic of 
military infrastructure and climate resilience.  
 
Our installations are key platforms for our nation’s defense.  They are our power 
projection platforms and support every mission the DoD Components undertake to defend this 
nation.   
 
Therefore, we must work to ensure installations and infrastructure are resilient to a wide 
range of challenges to include climate change, disruptions to energy or water supplies, and direct 
physical or cyber-attacks.   
 
Federal law mandates that the Secretary of Defense “shall ensure readiness of the armed 
forces for their military missions by pursuing energy security and energy resilience” (10 U.S.C. 
2911).    
 
The term “military installation resilience” means the capability of a military installation 
to avoid, prepare for, minimize the effect of, adapt to, and recover from extreme weather events, 
or from anticipated or unanticipated changes in environmental conditions, that do, or have the 
potential to, adversely affect the military installation or essential transportation, logistical, or 
other necessary resources outside of the military installation that are necessary in order to 
maintain, improve, or rapidly reestablish installation mission assurance and mission-essential 
functions 
 
The Department has been and will continue to be proactive in developing comprehensive 
policy, guidance, and tools to ensure installation resilience, with a focus on robust infrastructure, 
sound land management policies, and increased energy and climate resilience.   
 
 
Climate Change 
 
To successfully execute the DoD mission, the Military Departments must have the 
energy, land, air, and water resources necessary to train and operate in a world adversely 
impacted by a changing climate.  Additionally, the Department must build in climate resilience 
into our formations, equipment, human capital, and all enabling energy, water and 
communications systems.  
 
Climate change is already negatively impacting the Department’s missions.  From 
melting Arctic sea ice and thawing permafrost, to wildfires, hurricanes, drought, and sea level 
rise, the impacts of climate change on the operational environment are placing significant 
demands on our forces, and our interagency and international partners.  
 
Severe weather related events at Tyndall AFB, Offutt AFB, and Camp Lejeune over the 
past five years are sober reminders of the catastrophic effects that climate change can have on the 
1 
 
 
Department’s missions. These events, including the recent degrading effects of Winter Storm 
Uri, are representative of the climate-changed weather conditions we can expect in the future.  
 
Climate change impacts can affect sources of supplies, equipment, vehicles, and weapons 
systems as well as their distribution and storage. Environmental Justice considerations require 
that training and testing, as well as acquisition actions, are not disproportionately impacting low 
income and/or minority populations (EO 13985 and EO 13990). Risks and opportunities will be 
coordinated through the updated DoD Environmental Justice Strategy to be developed per EO 
14008. 
 
 As the National Climate Assessment makes clear, continued growth in greenhouse gas 
emissions along the current trend risks “unanticipated changes and impacts, some of which are 
potentially large and irreversible.” (Fourth National Climate Assessment, Vol 1) 
 
In other words, we need to act now to ensure climate change effects do not outpace 
mitigation efforts.  The Department of Defense, by the nature of our national security role, 
manages risk.  The evidence is clear: we must act deliberately today to avoid untenable risk in 
the future.      
 
  Given the current trajectory, these demands are likely to increase. According to recent, 
authoritative, and actionable science, the effects of climate change will outpace mitigation efforts 
at least for the next 20-50 years. To avoid unmanageable effects impacting mission, we must 
begin mitigation now at the same time we are adapting to observed and reasonably foreseeable 
climate changes. 
 
Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, identifies 
climate change as a national security issue and directs the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), in 
coordination with inter-agency stakeholders, to submit to the President, an analysis of the 
security implications of climate change (Climate Risk Analysis) that can be incorporated into 
modeling, simulation, war-gaming, and other analyses. 
 
EO 14008 further directs the SECDEF and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) 
to consider the security implications of climate change, inclusive of Climate Risk Analysis 
findings, in developing the National Defense Strategy, Defense Planning Guidance, Chairman’s 
Risk Assessment, and other relevant strategy, planning, and programming documents and 
processes. 
 
EO 14008 Section 211 directs the head of each agency to submit a draft Climate Action 
Plan to the National Climate Task Force and the Federal Chief Sustainability Officer that 
describes steps the agency can take with regard to its facilities and operations to bolster 
adaptation and increase resilience to the impacts of climate change. The Plan focuses on climate 
change adaptation in accordance with the Interim Instructions for Preparing Draft Climate Action 
Plans Under Executive Order 14008, released by the Council on Environmental Quality on 3 
March 2021, and subsequent instructions. 
 
2 
 
 
The Department’s Plan is almost complete and will be submitted on 27 May 2021.   The 
plan integrates climate considerations across the full spectrum of our activities to ensure a ready 
and capable force. It complements the DoD Sustainability Report and Implementation Plan 
(SRIP), which addresses greenhouse gas reduction, real property management, fleet and 
mobility, sustainable procurement, and electronics stewardship and data centers. 
 
Climate Action Plan – Climate Literate Workforce 
 
DoD Senior Leaders are tasked with translating abstract climate hazards to address 
meaningful emerging risks and to identify gaps in existing knowledge and staff capacities. 
Building climate literacy and capability in the workforce appropriate for different functional 
areas will enable the Department to identify and address climate readiness actions across their 
areas of responsibility and successfully carry out the mission in an era of rapidly changing 
climatic conditions.  
 
By focusing on climate literacy, the Department will ensure that climate change 
considerations and impacts are factored into all relevant and applicable DoD decisions. While 
some experts must know how to assess scientifically credible information about climate and 
communicate about climate and climate change in a meaningful way to support decision-makers, 
other staff will receive climate literacy training appropriate for their functions 
 
The Department is committed to integrating climate change literacy into all its training 
and education efforts, from skill-specific military education to graduate training in the war 
colleges.  This includes activities related to developing, acquiring, fielding, sustaining equipment 
and services, and installation practitioners. For example, installation management teams should 
attain climate literacy levels to support their risk-informed and responsible decisions. 
 
Climate Action Plan – Understanding Climate Vulnerabilities 
 
A key component of the Climate Action Plan task is a description of each agency’s 
climate vulnerabilities, particularly in the area of installation, building and facility energy, and 
water efficiency. In mid-Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Environment and Energy Resilience chose to proceed with the development of the 
DoD Climate Assessment Tool (DCAT), a Department- wide, screening-level climate hazard 
assessment tool based on an existing geospatial tool developed by the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers (USACE) for the Department of Army (Office of the Assistant Secretary for the Army 
for Installations, Energy, and Environment).  
 
The DCAT relies on the best available data and model outputs already produced and 
processed into forms amenable for producing actionable assessments of future climate exposure 
to eight hazards: coastal flooding, riverine flooding, heat, drought, energy demand, land 
degradation, wildfire, and historical extreme weather events. It includes customizable reports that 
can be used to prioritize installations for further, more detailed study of exposure, sensitivity, and 
adaptive capacity (ESAC); support effective and efficient planning; and identify climate 
resilience measures.  
 
3 
 
 
With the release of the DoD Climate Assessment Tool (DCAT), DoD now has the 
capability to quantify and compare installation exposure to climate hazards out into the future. 
On April 22, 2021 the Department published a report entitled “DoD Installation Exposure to 
Climate Change at Home and Abroad” which provides analysis of installation exposure to 
climate change hazards at over 1400 installations at home and abroad.  
 
This assessment helps identify the climate hazards to which DoD installations are most 
exposed, which is the first step in addressing the potential physical harm, security impacts, and 
degradation in readiness resulting from global climate change. Assessing the sensitivity of an 
installation to its climate hazard exposure is the next step, followed by identifying measures to 
reduce exposure and sensitivity.  Information in this report, combined with other DoD data and 
analytical results, will be used to support that Climate Risk Analysis.   
 
 
Building Installation and Range Resiliency 
 
The Department incorporates climate resilience as a cross-cutting consideration for our 
planning and decision-making processes, and not as a separate program or specific set of actions.  
Specifically, the Department considers resilience in the installation planning and basing 
processes.  This includes consideration of environmental vulnerabilities in installation master 
planning, management of natural resources, design and construction standards, utility systems 
and service, as well as emergency management operations. 
 
The DoD has a worldwide footprint – almost 3 million military and civilian personnel, 
more than 26 million acres, and over 603,385 facilities encompassing more than 2.2 billion 
square feet and valued at more than $1,210 billion (B); many of which serve specialized, 
mission-critical purposes. These assets are distributed across the Services (Army, Air Force, 
Navy, Marine Corps, and Space Force) and numerous DoD agencies, each with distinct 
operations.  
 
The Department’s installations remain critical components of its ability to fight and win 
wars. Our warfighters cannot do their job without bases from which to fight, on which to train, or 
in which to live when they are not deployed. Our installations support our families – many of 
whom live there and all of whom use their support services. The bottom line is that installations 
support our military readiness. To ensure that our installations are prepared to support the 
defense of this nation, the Department takes a broad, systemic approach that considers climate 
and man-made threats to built and natural infrastructure.  Not only must we ensure that facilities 
themselves are resilient in the face of a range of threats, but we must also ensure that the 
surrounding land, water, and airspace can support mission-essential activities.  
 
Since 2010, DoD has developed a comprehensive set of policies, directives, and plans to 
manage the effects of climate change on its operations, missions, and facilities. The Department 
has a comprehensive approach to building climate-ready installations. This approach considers 
resilience in installation planning: installation master planning, installation energy planning 
(IEP), management of natural resources, design and construction standards, utility systems and 
service, and emergency management operations.  
4 
 
 
 
Facilities 
   
  Regarding the built environment, the Department pursues resilience through application 
of its building codes in both installation planning, and design and construction of individual 
facilities.  The Department updates these building codes, collectively known as Unified Facilities 
Criteria and Unified Facilities Guide Specifications, on a regular basis to reflect revised industry 
and federal standards.  As building technologies improve and data from natural disasters 
increases over time, these standards become more stringent towards protecting life and property 
in these types of events.   
 
  The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 amended 10 USC 
Section 2864 to require that installation master plans address risks and threats to installation 
resilience, including those from climate change.  The Department’s September 2020 update to 
UFC 2-100-01, Installation Master Planning directs installations to incorporate climate 
resilience analysis in master planning activities to ensure mission sustainment over the intended 
lifespan of infrastructure and assets.  The UFC also provides instruction on the use of climate 
scenario planning, and refers to the DoD Climate Assessment Tool (DCAT) and the DoD 
Regional Sea Level Database (DRSL).   To aid in implementation, the Military Departments 
have established handbooks to support installation staff as they incorporate climate change into 
installation planning.  
 
  Outputs from the Department’s forthcoming Climate Risk Analysis and Climate Action 
Plan will be used to further inform and update the Department’s installation master planning 
efforts.   In master planning for effects of climate change, the Department is taking a broad and 
holistic approach.  For example, sea walls might reduce risks on an installation, however, 
without considerations for managing local circulation effects, they could result in induced 
flooding elsewhere.  Additionally planning and design of built and natural infrastructure must 
assess the effects of infrastructure projects on local areas to avoid disproportionate impacts to 
low income and minority communities.  
 
The challenge to maintain present built and natural infrastructure into the future will vary 
depending on location, climate hazard exposure, and sensitivity of missions and operations. 
Improving understanding of infrastructure components and ecosystems is critical.  
 
Information about how natural ecosystems contribute to ecosystem services and climate 
resilience, and how they overlap with the built environment provide insight into how to design 
better solutions that account for the condition and benefits of the whole system. For example, as 
we have previously reported, coastal ecosystems—including wetlands, marshes, and 
mangroves—may shield communities from the impacts of climate change. 
 
Planning for future infrastructure and new DoD installations can also take decades.  The 
DoD’s global property holdings are worth nearly $1.2 trillion (DoD 2020b).  As the frequency of 
extreme weather events has increased, the DoD must consider the related risks and make wise 
investment decisions to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather on the DoD’s mission. 
 
5 
 
 
Recent updates to Unified Facilities Criteria to incorporate forward-looking projections 
of climate-related data into its planning and design criteria include the following: 
 
•  UFC 3-201-01, Civil Engineering. Includes sections on minimum design flood elevation 
and flood mitigation requirements, flood resistant design options, and flood protection 
systems.   Establishes a technical approach for using the DoD Regional Sea Level 
Database at coastal installations to determine future inundated areas, future floodplains, 
and design flood elevations.  
 
•  UFC 3-201-02, Landscape Architecture. Directs all DoD projects to design plantings for 
climate resiliency. States DoD projects must consider potential climate change effects 
and address the effects through strategic land use planning, modifications, and design 
interventions. 
 
•  UFC 1-200-02, High Performance and Sustainable Building Requirements. Requires 
that new building designs are “responsive to any Government-provided projections of 
climate change and determination of acceptable risk.” Directs DoD Components to 
identify and implement operations and maintenance policies that improve the climate 
resiliency of facilities and operations. 
 
Related Unified Facilities Criteria updates for extreme events include the following: 
 
•  UFC 3-301-01, Structural Engineering. Provides design load combinations for 
designing structural components that are sensitive to vertical earthquake ground motion.  
 
•  UFC 3-400-02, Engineering Weather Data. Directs installation planners to request 
engineering weather data from Air Force’s 14th Weather Squadron that focuses on 
climatic variables of temperature, humidity, precipitation, and winds. 
 
Environmental Conservation and Compatible Development 
 
The Department’s lands and waters are vital to readiness.  As training, testing, and 
operational requirements expand and new weapons systems are introduced, access and use of 
ranges becomes increasingly important.  Managing for healthy and resilient natural landscapes, 
such as reducing fire risks, avoiding wildlife conflicts, removing invasive species, and improving 
range and training areas, provides the conditions necessary for mission-essential activities. 
 
This includes opportunities to maintain and improve “natural infrastructure,” 
implementing solutions outside installation boundaries to enhance the benefits provided by 
natural systems.  Natural infrastructure solutions encompasses a wide range of possible actions 
that can help promote installation resilience and preserve access to critical installation and range 
assets and capabilities.   
 
For example: restoring historical hydrology (e.g., wetlands and coastal marshes) can help 
reduce flooding impacts on coastal infrastructure; reestablishing oyster reefs and restoring 
shoreline and dune vegetation can help reduce impacts of storm surge on low-lying installations; 
restoring high-value habitat can enhance wildlife corridors for threatened, endangered, or at-risk 
6 
 
 
species and avoid or mitigate regulatory restrictions on training, testing, and operations; and 
removing vegetation and managing fuel loads can minimize wildfire risk to infrastructure, 
personnel, and operations. 
 
To assist installations in developing plans to manage the evolving natural resources 
challenges, the DoD worked with the National Wildlife Federation to develop planning guidance 
– “Climate Adaptation for DoD Natural Resource Managers.”  The guide, published in June 
2019, provides an overview of how a changing climate may affect military lands and other 
resources, and outlines a process to incorporate adaptation strategies into Integrated Natural 
Resource Management Plans (INRMP).   
 
Two key programs that are facilitating the Department’s sustainment efforts are the 
Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Program (REPI) and the Sentinel 
Landscapes Program.  
 
Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Program (REPI) – The REPI 
program preserves test, training, and operational capabilities that enable readiness, strengthens 
strategic partnerships, and supports test, training, and operational capability.  The REPI program 
stimulates innovative and diverse partnerships between local communities and military 
installations that increase collaboration and promote installation resilience.  Partnership 
agreements provide installation commanders, trainers, testers, and operators with increased 
mission flexibility by preventing, mitigating, or removing restrictions that can result from nearby 
incompatible development.  In the last 16 years, REPI partnerships have protected more than 
586,000 acres of land around 106 installations in 33 states. 
 
In FY 2019, the Department was provided expanded authority under 10 U.S.C. 2684a to 
specifically address military installation resilience as a key element of the REPI program.  This 
authority further enhances the REPI program’s ability to engage in collaborative land protection 
and natural resource management activities to help installations avoid, prepare for, minimize the 
effect of, adapt to, and recover from extreme weather events, or from anticipated or 
unanticipated changes in environmental conditions.   
 
Sentinel Landscapes Program – The Sentinel Landscapes Program coordinates between 
DoD, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Department of the Interior (DOI). This 
coalition of federal agencies, state governments, local communities, and private conservation 
organizations works to advance shared land-use goals around military bases.  
 
The program works closely to identify landscapes across the country where all three 
missions of the federal agencies—promoting sustainable agricultural and forestry rural lands, 
strengthening national defense, and building community resilience to climate change—intersect. 
Once identified, the three agencies coordinate to target their various conservation programs to 
properties within these priority areas. Each project site, or “sentinel landscape” has been 
remarkably successful in collaborating across agricultural, defense, and conservation sectors to 
tackle complex issues related to water quantity and quality, imperiled species habitat, and 
wildfire mitigation.  
 
7 
 
 
Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation  
 
Many states and communities across the country support the mission of the DoD. 
Through its Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation (OLDCC), the Department is 
leveraging the capabilities of state and local partners through grants and technical assistance to 
enhance the readiness of its installations and ranges, and to deliver safe places for its members 
and their families where capabilities in DoD do not otherwise exist.  
 
OLDCC’s program portfolio is comprised of over 200 separate grants, exceeding $1.3 
billion.  Recently through its Defense Community Infrastructure Program (DCIP), OLDCC has 
funded projects to support communities serving Fort Huachuca, Arizona, and Joint Region 
Marianas, at Tinian.  These projects are improving community utility infrastructure which in turn 
is strengthening the resilience of the strategic support area serving the bases.  In the NDAA for 
FY2021, Congress amended 10 USC Section 2391 to enhance DCIP’s ability to facilitate 
investments in community infrastructure projects that bolster military installation resilience.  As 
part of its holistic approach, the Department is continuing to explore ways to use the DCIP 
program to enhance its internal climate and energy resilience approach.  
 
 
Research 
 
DoD’s Strategic Environmental Research and Develop Program (SERDP) and 
Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) invest in research focused 
on improving DoD understanding of environmental and climate related risks to installations and 
mission.  DoD uses the SERDP and ESTCP programs to validate and fund sustainable design 
initiatives and cutting-edge clean energy technologies that can reduce DoD’s vulnerability to 
climate change and increase resilience to unavoidable impacts.  The following are a few 
examples of SERDP research efforts related to infrastructure and climate resiliency: 
 
  In response to coastal threats associated with rising sea level, SERDP initiated the DoD-
led Coastal Assessment Regional Scenario Working Group and developed the DoD 
Regional Sea Level Database (DRSL) to provide authoritative, scenario driven sea level 
change information relevant to each coastal installation. The DRSL is now publicly 
available so that contracted third parties (e.g., engineering firms), can use the future sea 
level change information for coastal installation and facilities planning. This availability 
is critical since DoD installation master planning standards and civil engineering design 
standards now incorporate DRSL information into installation planning. 
 
  In response to drought risk, SERDP initiated a study to understand and assess 
environmental vulnerabilities on installations in the desert southwest.  This research seeks 
to detect and assess drought response of sensitive riparian forests to drought stress over 
recent decades and will be carried out within three DoD bases in the Southwest, with 
widely applicable results. 
 
  In response to wildfire risk, SERDP developed a Fire Science Strategy in 2014 focused 
on the following: improved characterization, monitoring, modeling, and mapping of fuels 
8 
 
 
to support enhanced smoke management and fire planning at DoD installations; enhanced 
smoke management using advanced monitoring and modeling approaches; and research 
to quantify, model, and monitor post-fire effects. 
 
  SERDP and ESTCP investments seek to understand changes to the Arctic terrestrial 
environment relevant to DoD infrastructure.  Permafrost degradation can impact soil, 
vegetation, buildings, roads, and airfields.  SERDP and ESTCP investments are leading 
to tools for making Arctic infrastructure more “aware” of permafrost changes before 
costly failures occur.  An example is Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s fiber-
optic geophysical sensing package capable of providing real-time information on 
subsurface conditions relevant to infrastructure performance and failure in Arctic 
environments. 
 
Traditionally, the Department has been challenged in transferring clean energy technologies 
from the SERDP and ESTCP programs over the “valley of death” from concept to programs of 
record.  The Department is revitalizing efforts to facilitate technology transfer through directed 
programs such as the Energy Resilience and Conservation Investment Program (ERCIP), as well 
as third-party financed authorities.   
 
 
Energy Programs 
 
Unlike the Department’s MilCon and Environmental Remediation programs, where the 
budget request includes specific line items, our energy programs are subsumed across other 
accounts.  
 
Energy Resilience Policies, Programs, and Tools 
 
As defined in Section 101 of Title 10, energy resilience is the “ability to avoid, prepare for, 
minimize, adapt to, and recover from anticipated and unanticipated energy disruptions in order to 
ensure energy availability and reliability sufficient to provide for mission assurance and 
readiness, including mission essential operations related to readiness, and to execute or rapidly 
reestablish mission essential requirements.”   
 
The Department utilizes a portfolio of appropriated and third party financed programs to 
pursue energy resilience.  These programs are governed by key instructions and policies to 
ensure warfighter requirements are addressed holistically and in a prioritized and cost effective 
manner.      
 
Policies and Programs 
 
The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment (ASD(S)) provides 
policy and oversight to the military departments and defense agencies that align to the energy 
resilience requirements of Title 10 and Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 4170.11, 
Installation Energy Management.  The Department implements policies through critical 
initiatives, such as installation energy planning, energy resilience assessments, and black start 
9 
 
 
exercises.  The Department also pursues partnerships with other agencies, such as the 
Department of Energy.  
 
Department of Defense Instruction 4170.11, Installation Energy Management –  
 
This formal policy provides guidance, assigns responsibilities, and prescribes procedures 
for all DoD installation energy management activities to include energy and climate resilience 
requirements.  It is currently being rewritten to further strengthen the role of installation energy 
plans and the inclusion of energy resilience, climate and cybersecurity provisions.    
 
Installation Energy Plans –  
 
Through the Installation Energy Planning (IEP) process, military installations are tasked 
with identifying mission critical loads, assessing energy resilience and cybersecurity gaps, and 
developing scalable and cost effective solutions to close those gaps.  The Services are finishing 
IEPs for priority mission installations and are submitting plans for top energy consuming 
installations by the end of FY21.  All remaining installations are targeted for completion by the 
end of FY22.   
 
The Department’s IEP framework is being enhanced to address the short, medium, and 
long-term impacts of climate change.  Specifically, climate scenario planning, using the DoD 
Climate Assessment Tool (DCAT) and the DoD Regional Sea Level Database (DRSL), is 
informing the Department’s Installation Master Planning and Installation Energy Planning (IEP) 
processes.  Additionally, the IEP process is being reviewed to potentially integrate climate 
objectives and weighting factors such as GHG reduction, the social cost of carbon, and 
environmental justice in its decision-making calculus. 
 
In the IEP process installations leverage a portfolio of energy authorities and technology 
solutions to close critical energy and climate resilience gaps.  As part of its climate adaptation 
and mitigation efforts, the Department is seeking ways to increase the use of clean energy and 
other GHG reducing solutions in its pursuit of energy resilience.  Presently, more than 15% of 
the electricity used by DoD facilities is from renewable sources, and DoD is the largest producer 
of onsite renewable energy in the federal government.  
 
The intermittency of clean energy technologies has historically presented a challenge in 
terms of closing energy resilience gaps identified in the IEP process.  The Department is 
“moving the needle forward” by exploring ways to integrate renewables with other technologies 
(i.e., micro-grids, battery energy storage, etc.) to overcome these challenges.   IEPs are “living 
documents”, and the Department will update them frequently to incorporate advancements in 
clean energy technologies and battery storage. 
 
Energy Resilience and Conservation Investment Program (ERCIP) –  
 
ERCIP is a subset of the Defense-Wide Military Construction Program, specifically 
intended to fund projects that improve energy resilience, contribute to mission assurance, save 
10 
 
 
energy, and reduce DoD’s energy costs.  ERCIP accomplishes these goals through construction 
of new, high-efficiency energy systems or through modernizing existing energy systems.   
 
The ERCIP program has executed over 511 high priority projects from FY09-21 including the 
implementation of micro-grids, renewable energy generation (i.e., solar PV, solar thermal, wind, 
etc.) building efficiency enhancements, and utility distribution improvements [~$900M+ 
portfolio].    
 
For example, at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Miramar the ERCIP program 
facilitated the implementation of an installation level micro-grid which enables the base to 
operate during disruptions to the commercial grid. The base has a power plant with both diesel 
and natural gas generation to supplement existing landfill gas and solar power, providing a total 
of 11.2 MW of on-site power generation. Additionally, a new energy and water operations center 
was built to consolidate the microgrid control system with other utility management systems at 
the air station.   
 
The Department is exploring ways to better integrate ERCIP with broader climate and 
modernization initiatives (including technology transfer).  Additionally, as part of the NDAA for 
FY2021, congress has provided the authority to use ERCIP with other funding sources such as 
Energy Savings Performance Contracts and Utilities Privatization.  
 
Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC)/Utility Energy Savings Contracts (UESC) –  
 
DoD seeks opportunities to enhance energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption as 
part of its efforts to strengthen energy resilience.  Energy efficiency bolsters installation energy 
resilience by helping reduce the energy demand from distributed energy production resources 
during commercial grid disruptions.  Energy efficiency is also a practical way that the DoD is 
reducing its carbon footprint in alignment with the tenets of EO14008, the Energy Act of 2020, 
the Federal Sustainability Framework, and broader DoD climate mitigation goals.  
 
The Department continues to utilize performance contracting (i.e., ESPCs/UESCs) as a 
significant part of its efforts to enhance energy resilience through energy efficiency.   
 
For example, through an ESPC at Marine Corps Recruitment Depot (MCRD) Parris 
Island the Marine Corps has enhanced readiness through the installation of a 3.5 megawatt 
combined heat and power plant (CHPP), 6.7 megawatts of solar photovoltaic panels with 
integrated energy storage, and a microgrid control system.  Built above the flood zone, the CHPP 
is less susceptible to hurricanes, storms and sea level rise.  Implementation of clean energy 
technologies and other equipment upgrades will reduce energy consumption by 88% and water 
consumption by 25%.  Based in part to savings from the ESPC, MCRD Parris Island decreased 
its electricity purchased from the commercial grid by more than 50% in FY20 compared to 
FY19. 
 
Additionally, in July 2019, the Navy awarded its largest ever ESPC to Naval Station 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to build a new power plant, improve resiliency and reliability, increase 
efficiency, and add renewable generation to this self-sufficient critical installation. The project 
11 
 
 
will provide 12 MW of solar photovoltaic energy generation, battery energy storage, water and 
sewer improvements, major building system upgrades, and a dual-fuel (F76 fuel oil and 
Liquefied Natural Gas) Combined Cycle Power Plant. Annual savings for this ESPC are 
expected to reach nearly 4 million BTUs and 1 million gallons of water. 
 
Since 2011 the Department has awarded over $5.1B in performance contracts and its 
portfolio is the largest in the federal government.  Due in large part to efficiencies from these 
contracts, the Department has also achieved an energy intensity reduction of 20.9% from FY 
2003 to 2019, contributing to GHG reductions.  
 
In furtherance of its forthcoming Climate Action Plan and in alignment of the Installation 
Energy Planning process, the Department is posturing itself for further performance contracting 
investments in FY2022 and beyond.  The Department’s efforts will be informed and enabled by 
the Energy Act of 2020.   
 
10 USC 2912 Energy Cost Savings – 
 
The Military Services continue to leverage authority granted under 10 U.S.C. Section 
2912 to retain amounts equal to energy cost savings in order to fund additional energy resilience, 
energy efficiency, and installation quality of life projects.  In FY2019 and FY2020, the Military 
Departments piloted efforts to retain $115M in installation energy cost savings using the 
authority.  Presently, the Military Departments are piloting efforts to utilize funds pursuant to the 
statute and DoD financial regulations.   
 
Other Alternative Financing Authorities –  
 
The Department continues to leverage other alternative financing authorities to 
implement energy resilient, climate-ready and cyber-secure solutions.  These include, but are not 
limited to, power purchase agreements (PPAs), enhanced use leases (EULs), and utilities 
privatization (UP), when supported by the business case and/or IEP.    
 
For example, at Edwards AFB, the Department is moving forward on an 800 megawatt 
renewable energy project that could be one of the largest solar arrays in the country, and would 
be the largest in the DoD. The Air Force estimates the project could provide power for an 
average of 238,000 homes in California, and could yield cash rent consideration up to $80 
million throughout the expected 35-year enhanced use lease. 
 
Micro-reactor Demonstration –  
 
As directed in the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, the Department of 
Defense is seeking to demonstrate a commercially developed, Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(NRC) licensed, very Small Modular Reactor (vSMR) to power critical loads at a permanent 
domestic military installation by December 2027.  An RFP for the pilot base currently under 
development, to be issued this year; planned selection of a vendor by 2022 to demonstrate a 
micro-reactor on a DoD (Air Force) installation by 2027. Industry is making steady progress in 
developing advanced micro-reactors with the potential to enhance installation resilience through 
12 
 
 
assured access to power in support of critical missions and remote operations.  The Department 
will use the proposed demonstration to assess the energy resilience capability and the cost 
effectiveness of vSMR technology.  
 
Exercises and Tools 
 
To facilitate the implementation of energy resilience policy, the Department is utilizing exercises 
and analysis tools to continually improve our approach. 
 
Black Start Exercises (BSEs) –  
 
In accordance with U.S. Code Title 10 Section 2911 and DoD instruction 4170.11, the 
Department is performing BSEs to evaluate energy resilience risks to readiness while completely 
separated from the commercial electric grid.  Since 2015, the Department has conducted over 35 
site-level energy resilience assessments, tabletop exercises, and black start exercises to 
implement its policies.  The lessons learned from these initiatives have been used to develop 
Department-wide policies and procedures to drive behavioral and cultural awareness for 
installation personnel and energy managers.  
 
To ensure the readiness of its installations, the Department routinely conducts statutory 
“black start exercises” where installations are disconnected from the wider power grid to 
determine the resilience of on-site power generation. These black start exercises were completed 
at Fort Stewart, Fort Greely, Fort Bragg, Hanscom AFB, Vandenberg AFB, Joint Base McGuire-
Dix-Lakehurst, and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.   BSEs identify critical energy 
vulnerabilities and interdependencies that could degrade critical missions, assess latent risks in 
an installations energy resilience posture, and inform the development of appropriate mitigations.   
 
Cyber Secure Facilities 
 
Given the importance of energy resilient facilities as nodes for projecting and sustaining power, 
the Department is reducing the cyber risks to facility related control systems (FRCS).  Building 
on the July 2018 Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum, Enhancing Cybersecurity Risk 
Management for Control Systems (CS) Supporting DoD Owned Defense Critical Infrastructure, 
my office has integrated the cyber security of industrial control systems into energy policies and 
guidance.   
 
The Department is developing internal requirements for ‘inside the fence’ as well as 
requirements for external partners ‘outside the fence’ to be cyber-secure and cyber-resilient.  For 
example, military installations are including cyber security considerations in the development of 
their installation energy plans, and FRCS considerations are now required for utility privatization 
agreements, ESPCs, and UESCs.    
 
We will continue to work with the Department’s Chief Information Officer and Principal Cyber 
Advisor toward solutions and resources ensuring FRCS are defensible, survivable, and resilient 
to operate and sustain critical functions in a cyber-contested environment.  My office also plans 
13 
 
 
to incorporate relevant and timely FRCS cybersecurity requirements in our forthcoming rewrite 
of DoDI 4170.11 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the Department’s efforts to build resilient and climate 
ready installations.  Your continued support of Department of Defense’s mission and for our 
military members and their families is appreciated.

WRITTEN TESTIMONY OF 
CHARLES P. RETTIG 
COMMISSIONER 
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE 
BEFORE THE 
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT 
ON IRS OPERATIONS 
MAY 19, 2021 
 
INTRODUCTION 
  
Chairman  Van  Hollen,  Ranking  Member  Hyde-Smith  and  Members  of  the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to update you on IRS operations, 
especially the work we have been doing to help taxpayers during the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
 
I am pleased to report the 2021 filing season has gone smoothly in terms of tax 
return processing and the operation of our information technology (IT) systems. 
Through May 7, the IRS received more than 126.7 million individual federal tax 
returns and issued more than 84.8 million refunds totaling more than $242.8 billion. 
A more detailed discussion of the filing season is provided later in this testimony. 
 
At the same time, the IRS is working closely with the Treasury Department to 
implement the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP Act) as quickly as possible 
to help the nation’s taxpayers. As part of these efforts, we took immediate steps to 
begin delivery of the third round of Economic Impact Payments (EIP) to millions of 
Americans within days of the legislation being signed on March 11. Through May 
12, we have disbursed about 165 million payments totaling approximately $388 
billion. The IRS is also coordinating with Treasury on another important provision, 
which provides periodic advance payments of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) to eligible 
Americans. The IRS will be working hard to deliver this program quickly and 
efficiently. 
 
Now in my third year as Commissioner, I remain extremely proud to be working for 
the IRS and excited about the future of our agency. We are grateful for the 
increased and multi-year funding that will allow the IRS to (i) modernize our 
systems,  (ii)  increase  our  workforce  and  their  capabilities  through  a  robust 
recruitment and training program, (iii) implement the provisions of the Taxpayer 
First  Act,  including  improving  the  taxpayer  experience,  and  (iv)  conduct 
compliance activities that support our voluntary tax compliance system. 
 
My  experiences  as  Commissioner  have  strengthened  my  belief  that  a  fully 
functioning IRS is critical to the success of our nation. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, 
the IRS collected $3.56 trillion in taxes and generated almost 96 percent of the 
  1 
     
 
funding that supports the Federal Government’s operations. We serve and interact 
with more Americans than nearly any other public or private organization. 
 
This unprecedented pandemic illustrates the significant role that the IRS plays in 
the overall health of our country. We have been called to provide economic relief 
during this national crisis while also fulfilling our routine responsibilities of tax 
administration.  
 
I am proud that IRS employees have responded admirably to the COVID-19 
situation by quickly facilitating financial assistance and administrative relief to 
hundreds of millions of deserving and needy Americans – including distributing 
$800 billion in Economic Impact Payments since the spring of last year. People at 
the IRS continually demonstrate just how much they care, and how important the 
agency is to our country, by their heroic response to events over the past year. At 
the same time, the IRS remains focused on its core mission, striving to serve 
taxpayers  in  a  manner  that  facilitates  voluntary  compliance  by  providing 
meaningful  guidance  and  proper  levels  of  staffing  and  support  at  points  of 
significant taxpayer interaction.  
 
Given the events of the past year, we appreciate the $3.1 billion in additional 
funding we received from Congress to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and 
implement the EIPs and other tax changes. In addition, our base FY 2021 funding 
level (excluding these additional resources) represents a 3.6 percent increase over 
FY 2020.  However, it will take time to overcome the challenges of the past decade, 
and the agency will continue to struggle to replace employees lost through attrition 
and expand our workforce, support implementation of our multi-year Integrated 
Modernization Business Plan as designed, and continue enhancing meaningful 
service and compliance efforts that will  earn the trust and respect of every 
American and improve our working relationships with taxpayers and others in the 
tax community.   
 
We respect and proudly serve all taxpayers, none more or less so than any other. 
We must  operate from  their  perspective, through  their  eyes, enhancing  their 
experiences while striving to provide clear, meaningful guidance and services, in 
the language of their choice, wherever possible. In support of compliant taxpayers, 
we must aggressively pursue non-compliant taxpayers by maintaining robust, 
visible civil and criminal enforcement efforts. We are making a difference, and we 
want to continue to successfully pursue our mission on behalf of our great country. 
 
 
INVESTING IN THE IRS TO IMPROVE TAX ADMINISTRATION 
 
The President’s FY 2022 Discretionary Funding Request 
 
The  President’s  FY  2022  Discretionary  Request  advances  key  Treasury 
Department priorities, including ensuring that all Americans are treated fairly by 
  2 
     
 
our tax system. The request provides increased funding for the IRS to provide 
additional oversight of high-income and corporate tax returns, ensuring that the 
wealthy and well-connected pay what they owe and play by the same rules as 
everybody else. 
 
To ensure that all Americans are treated fairly by the nation’s tax system, including 
that the wealthy and corporations comply with existing laws, the discretionary 
request provides $13.2 billion for the IRS, an increase of $1.2 billion or 10.4-
percent above the 2021 enacted level. 
  
With this funding, the IRS would: increase oversight of high-income and corporate 
tax returns to ensure compliance; provide new and improved online tools for 
taxpayers to communicate with the IRS easily and quickly; and improve telephone 
and in-person taxpayer customer service, including outreach and assistance to 
underserved communities.  
 
In addition to increases for base IRS enforcement funding, the 2022 discretionary 
request provides an additional increase of $417 million in discretionary funding 
through a proposed discretionary cap adjustment for tax enforcement as part of a 
multiyear tax initiative that would increase tax compliance and increase revenues. 
Altogether,  the  2022  discretionary  request  would  increase  resources  for  tax 
enforcement by $900 million. 
 
I would be happy to discuss the request further when we submit our more detailed 
Budget Justification later this spring. 
 
The American Families Plan 
 
A robust and sustained investment in the IRS is necessary to ensure it can do its 
job of administering a fair and effective tax system. In the American Families Plan, 
the President has included a series of proposals in that overhaul tax administration 
and provide the IRS the resources and information it needs to address tax evasion. 
All told, these reforms will generate an additional $700 billion in tax revenue over 
the  course  of  a  decade,  net  of  the  investments  made.  Specifically,  the  tax 
administration reforms will:  
•  Provide the IRS the resources it needs to stop sophisticated tax evasion. 
The IRS needs additional resources to pursue costly tax evasion. These 
cases are not easy to resolve; the average investigation of a high-wealth 
individual takes two years to complete and often requires the IRS to commit 
substantial  resources.  Moreover,  the  lack  of  adequate  investment  in 
compliance has significant revenue consequences. A key component of this 
initiative  is  the  provision  of  a  sustained,  multi-year  stream  of  funding. 
Altogether, the proposal directs roughly $80 billion to the IRS over a decade 
to fund an array of priorities—including overhauling technology to improve 
enforcement  efforts,  which  is  more  effectively  implemented  with  the 
  3 
     
 
assurance of a consistent funding stream. This investment will also facilitate 
the IRS hiring and training auditors to focus on complex investigations of 
large corporations, partnerships, and global high-wealth individuals. The 
President’s  proposal  directs  that  additional  resources  go  toward 
enforcement against those with the highest incomes, rather than Americans 
with actual income of less than $400,000.  
•  Provide  the  IRS  with  more  complete  information.  When  the  IRS  has 
information from third parties, income is accurately reported, and taxes are 
fully  paid.  However,  high-income  taxpayers  disproportionately  accrue 
income in opaque sources—like partnership and proprietorship income—
where the IRS struggles to verify tax filings. This reform aims to provide the 
IRS information on account flows so that it has a lens into investment and 
business activity—similar to the information provided on income streams 
such  as  wage,  pension,  and  unemployment  income.  Importantly,  this 
proposal provides additional information to the IRS without any increased 
burden for taxpayers. Instead, it leverages the information that financial 
institutions already know about account holders, simply requiring that they 
add to their regular, annual reports information about aggregate account 
outflows and inflows. Providing the IRS this information will help improve 
audit selection so it can better target its enforcement activity on the most 
suspect  evaders,  avoiding  unnecessary  (and  costly)  audits  of  ordinary 
taxpayers. 
•  Overhaul  outdated  technology  to  help  the  IRS  identify  tax  evasion. 
Elements of IRS IT systems are antiquated and make it difficult for the IRS 
to identify those who are not paying what they owe and to help those who 
want to comply. The President’s proposal provides the IRS much-needed 
resources to modernize its technological infrastructure. Leveraging 21st 
century data analytic tools will enable the IRS make use of new information 
about income that accrues to high-earners and will help revenue agents 
unpack complex structures, like partnerships, where income is not easily 
traced.  
•  Improve taxpayer service and deliver tax credits. A well-functioning tax 
system requires that taxpayers be able to interact with the IRS in an efficient 
and  meaningful  manner.  Inadequate  resources  often  mean  that  IRS 
employees are unable to provide taxpayers timely answers to their tax 
questions.  Service  enhancement  will  improve  the  ability  of  the  IRS  to 
communicate  with  taxpayers  securely  and  promptly.  Importantly,  the 
proposal also includes the necessary resources to ensure that the IRS 
effectively  and  efficiently  delivers  tax  credits  to  families  and  workers, 
including newly expanded Child Tax Credits and Child and Dependent Care 
Tax Credits.  
•  Regulate paid tax preparers. Taxpayers often make use of unregulated tax 
preparers who lack the ability to provide accurate tax assistance. These 
  4 
     
 
preparers submit more tax returns than all other preparers combined, and 
they make costly mistakes that subject their customers to painful audits, 
sometimes even intentionally defrauding taxpayers for their own benefit. 
The President’s plan calls for giving the IRS the legal authority to implement 
safeguards in the tax preparation industry. It also includes stiffer penalties 
for unscrupulous preparers who fail to identify themselves on tax returns 
and defraud taxpayers (so called “ghost preparers”). 
 
 
UPDATE ON THE 2021 FILING SEASON 
 
The  IRS  workforce  navigated  preparation  for  the  2021  filing  season  while 
continuing  to  implement  COVID-related  relief  measures  and  delivering  an 
extended 2020 filing season. These circumstances challenged our ability to make 
the necessary annual changes for filing season 2021. Nonetheless, as a result of 
the ongoing efforts of our employees, the IRS is on track to deliver a smooth filing 
season again this year.   
 
I’m pleased to report the filing season opened successfully on February 12. To 
give you an idea of how well our systems performed, the IRS over that initial 
weekend received a total of 55 million submissions, which includes individual 
federal returns along with other items such as state tax returns, amended returns 
and returns filed by businesses. At the peak that weekend, our IT systems enabled 
us to successfully receive 335 submissions per second. 
 
The February 12 opening of the filing season was slightly later than in previous 
years. The delayed start gave the IRS time to do additional programming and 
testing of our systems following the December 27 tax law changes that provided 
the second round of EIPs and other benefits. The additional programming and 
testing ensured that people would receive their needed tax refunds quickly, and 
also receive any remaining stimulus tax credits they might be eligible for as quickly 
as possible. 
 
The delay in the start of the filing season did not add any additional delays to 
refunds on returns claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Additional 
Child Tax Credit (ACTC). By law the IRS cannot issue these refunds before 
February 15. This filing season, the IRS was able to issue refunds for EITC and 
ACTC returns on February 16 and 18, 2021. We expect those refunds were 
promptly available in taxpayer bank accounts if they chose direct deposit and there 
were no other issues with their tax return. We have encouraged taxpayers to e-file 
their returns and to check the Where’s My Refund online tool on IRS.gov or the 
IRS2Go app to find out their estimated refund date. 
 
On March 17, Treasury and the IRS announced that the deadline for individuals to 
file Form 1040 and pay their federal income tax has been extended from April 15, 
2021 to May 17, 2021. IRS Notice 2021-21 provides details on the additional tax 
  5 
     
 
deadlines which have been postponed until May 17. After carefully considering all 
the options, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS determined a limited 2021 
filing season deadline extension for individuals filing Form 1040 to May 17, 2021, 
was in the best interest of tax administration.  
 
All individuals had the option to obtain an automatic extension of time to file a 
federal income tax return until October 15, 2021. Taxpayers needed to request the 
filing extension on or before May 17, 2021. For most, the request only required 
their name, address and Social Security number.  
 
While we recognized the desire and importance of requests to further extend the 
2021 filing season deadline or expand the scope of the extension, doing so would 
have posed a significant potential risk to implementing the ARP Act. Additionally, 
it could have further delayed delivery of Recovery Rebate Credits (RRCs) and the 
third round of EIPs, as well as refunds—including EITC and CTC payments—to 
the most vulnerable Americans.  
 
As part of our work on the filing season, the IRS continues to spread the word 
about EIPs by reminding people who didn’t initially qualify for a payment – or didn’t 
receive the full amount – that they should check to see if they qualify to claim the 
payment as an RRC. The EIPs represented advance payments of the RRC, and 
this credit can be claimed on the 2020 tax return, by taxpayers and by individuals 
who don’t normally file. The 2020 Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR include 
a worksheet that can be used to calculate the amount of any RRC for which a 
taxpayer is eligible. Individuals are encouraged to file electronically to claim this 
credit, and most can do so at no cost with IRS Free File, including those who do 
not have a filing requirement.  
 
This process should not be a burdensome action for individuals, including those 
who normally do not file.  We realize that delayed processing of some 2019 returns 
could affect the ability of some taxpayers to claim the RRC, so we are working as 
quickly as possible to process outstanding returns. 
 
The IRS also will continue working with groups inside and outside the tax 
community to get information directly to people experiencing homelessness and 
other groups to help them receive payments in this latest round of EIPs. Our 
message to these groups is: For those who don’t normally file a tax return, they 
will need to file a basic return with the IRS. Doing so will provide the IRS with the 
information we need to deliver an EIP to them. Once that return is processed, the 
IRS can quickly send stimulus payments to an address selected by the eligible 
individual. People do not need a permanent address or a bank account, and the 
IRS will still issue the payment even if they haven’t filed a tax return in years. 
 
Another  important  filing  season  reminder  involves  people  who  received 
unemployment compensation during 2020. We are working to make sure they 
understand the tax law governing unemployment benefits they received pursuant 
  6 
     
 
to U.S. law or that of a state. In general, these payments are taxable and must be 
reported as income on taxpayers’ federal returns. These individuals should receive 
Form 1099-G showing the amount they were paid, along with any federal income 
tax they elected to have withheld. Since some states do not mail Form 1099-G, 
some recipients will need to get the electronic version of the form from their state’s 
website. 
 
However, the ARP Act exempts the first $10,200 in unemployment compensation 
from federal taxation for individuals with income below $150,000. For those who 
received unemployment benefits last year and have already filed their 2020 tax 
return, they should not file an amended return. 
 
As set forth in an IRS news release (IR-2021-71) issued on March 31, 2021, 
because the change occurred after some people filed their taxes, the IRS will take 
steps in the spring and summer to make the appropriate change to their return 
which may result in a refund. The first refunds are expected to be made in May 
and will continue into the summer. For those taxpayers who already have filed and 
figured their tax based on the full amount of unemployment compensation, the IRS 
will determine the correct taxable amount of unemployment compensation and tax. 
Any  resulting  overpayment  of  tax  will  be  either  refunded  or  applied  to  other 
outstanding taxes owed. For those who have already filed, the IRS will do these 
recalculations, in two phases starting with those taxpayers eligible for the $10,200 
exclusion. The IRS will then adjust returns for those married filing jointly taxpayers 
who are eligible for the $20,400 exclusion and others with more complex returns. 
 
There is no need for taxpayers to file an amended return unless the calculations 
make the taxpayer newly eligible for additional federal credits and deductions not 
already included on the original tax return. For example, the IRS can adjust returns 
for those taxpayers who claimed the EITC (or other credits) and, because the 
exclusion changed the income level, they may now be eligible for an increase in 
the EITC amount which may result in a larger refund. However, taxpayers would 
have to file an amended return if they did not originally claim the EITC but now are 
eligible because the exclusion changed their income. These taxpayers may want 
to review their state tax returns as well. 
 
The IRS is also working to alert taxpayers to an identity theft scam involving these 
payments.  There  have  been  instances  of  criminals  using  stolen  identities  to 
fraudulently  apply  for  and  receive  unemployment  compensation.  For  many 
individuals who did not claim unemployment compensation last year, this issue 
came to light when they began receiving 1099-G forms with amounts they never 
applied for or received. We encourage anyone in this situation to file an accurate 
return only reporting the taxable funds they actually received, report this fraud to 
the state agency that issued the 1099-G, and ask the agency to issue them a 
corrected 1099-G showing the correct amount. They can also go to dol.gov/fraud 
for more information about how to reach their state workforce agency and report 
this type of fraud.  
  7 
     
 
 
During this filing season, the IRS has continued to emphasize the safety and health 
of taxpayers and our employees. For that reason, our face-to-face operations have 
been limited to appointment services, with provision for assisting taxpayers with 
hardships on a walk-in basis. We believe that this year, it is more critical than ever 
for taxpayers and tax professionals to take advantage of e-filing and online and 
virtual services to help them with their taxes. We continue to encourage taxpayers 
to use electronic tools to the extent possible, including IRS.gov, where they will 
find a wealth of helpful information. 
 
For taxpayers who need help preparing and filing their returns, I’m pleased to 
report that the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for 
the Elderly (TCE) programs supported by the IRS have again been providing free 
assistance to eligible individuals.  I’m very proud of the work our VITA and TCE 
partners do during the filing season to help taxpayers at approximately 8,000 sites 
around the country, including military bases. This year, to ensure the health and 
safety of taxpayers and volunteers, many volunteer tax preparation sites have 
been offering virtual help to taxpayers, either over the phone or online. Some sites 
have still offered in-person tax help, but safety and social distancing have been 
emphasized. 
 
Understanding the need to plan for the future and the desire to maintain a safe 
operating environment, the IRS will continue operating under its current posture 
until further notice, and we will continue to follow – and where possible, exceed – 
applicable CDC guidelines for public health and safety and measures. We will 
continue to balance responding to urgent tax administration needs with doing 
everything possible to protect taxpayers and our employees.  
 
We appreciate the patience and understanding of taxpayers and tax professionals 
as we work to deliver the filing season during this challenging time. I am confident 
the IRS will deliver for the nation, just as it has during other times of national 
urgency. 
 
Phone Level of Service During the 2021 Filing Season 
 
An important service delivery channel, during the filing season and throughout the 
year, continues to be our toll-free telephone line, which constitutes one of the 
world’s largest customer service phone operations. This filing season through April 
16 the IRS has handled approximately 25.4 million taxpayer calls, with nearly one 
third, or 8.1 million, answered by our Customer Service Representatives (CSRs). 
The rest were calls made to lines providing automated messages containing 
helpful tax information.  
 
When we were submitting our Congressional Budget Justification level of service 
(LOS) estimates for the 2021 filing season last spring (before the pandemic, EIP1, 
EIP2, EIP3, partial exclusion of unemployment compensation, and other tax law 
  8 
     
 
changes emanating from several rounds of legislation), there was no way to predict 
the pandemic and the impact it would have on our call volume, filing season, and 
hiring. We are still working through the impacts of COVID-19, which created 
staffing shortages and closures, and we have been experiencing a much higher-
than-expected call volume coupled with an increase in call handling time caused 
by greater call complexity due to three rounds of EIPs and other tax law changes.  
 
We attempted to mitigate these issues by starting the CSR hiring process for the 
2021  filing  season  earlier  than  normal,  with  the  anticipation  that  the  high 
unemployment rate throughout the country might result in larger applicant pools in 
all locations. However, this was not the case. We set a CSR hiring goal for FY 
2021 of 5,000 CSRs but have encountered significant hiring challenges during the 
pandemic, including low applicant pools in some locations, delays in fingerprinting 
due to closed facilities, and delays in processing applicants virtually. As such, the 
IRS has onboarded approximately 3,800 CSRs (our largest-ever hiring of phone 
assistors for a filing season), for a total of approximately 13,760 CSRs.  We also 
expect to hire an additional 1,000 CSRs to be ready this summer with the funding 
provided in the ARP Act for implementation of the child tax credit changes, to 
address potential call volume increases.  
 
While  we  have  many  CSRs,  we  also  experienced  record-breaking  and 
unprecedented phone demand this year. For example, on March 15, 2021, we had 
8.6 million calls, which is approximately 1,500 calls per second. That volume was 
a 600 percent increase compared to normal call traffic. During a typical filing 
season, we average 2 to 3 million calls each day. Our ability to manage telephone 
demand is constrained by two factors: the number of assistors available and the 
capacity of the telephone routing equipment used to place callers in line for service. 
Accordingly, our current LOS for the 2021 filing season is significantly less than 
where we want to be, and that may fluctuate further based on increasing call 
volumes throughout the summer.  
 
Improving Service to Diverse Communities 
 
We view our efforts through the eyes and experience of those we proudly serve. 
An important way the IRS serves taxpayers during the filing season and throughout 
the year is by communicating with them in their most comfortable language. In 
preparing for the 2021 filing season, the IRS took important steps to further 
improve the amount of service we provide in multiple languages.  
 
Prior to this filing season, the IRS for years had been working to provide tax 
information in additional languages. For example, many pages of IRS.gov are 
available in Spanish, Vietnamese, Russian, Korean, Haitian Creole and Chinese 
(Simplified and Traditional), and basic tax information is available on the website 
in 20 languages. And the IRS continues to expand its efforts to post and link to 
information available in multiple languages on social media platforms, including 
Twitter and Instagram. 
  9 
     
 
 
I’m proud to say that this filing season, we are providing the Form 1040 in Spanish 
for the first time. Also for the first time, the 2020 Form 1040 gives taxpayers the 
opportunity to indicate whether they wish to be contacted in a language other than 
English.  
 
Other recent changes include making Publication 1, Your Rights as a Taxpayer, 
available in 20 languages. In addition, we have issued a new, streamlined version 
of Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax, that is easier to navigate and faster 
to download than previous versions, and is now accessible on most personal 
electronic  devices.  The  new  Publication  17  is  available  in  English,  Spanish, 
Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Vietnamese, Russian and Korean. 
 
Additionally, taxpayers who interact with an IRS representative now have access 
to over-the-phone interpreter services in more than 350 languages. The IRS has 
also recently begun inserting information about translation services and other 
multilingual options into the high-volume notices we send out to taxpayers. Our 
diverse workforce is proud to be reflective of the diverse communities we serve. 
 
 
PROVIDING RELIEF TO TAXPAYERS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
 
Delivering Economic Impact Payments 
 
While delivering last year’s filing season – which was the longest in history – and 
preparing for the 2021 filing season, IRS employees also worked many long hours 
to  implement  major  provisions  of  the  Coronavirus  Aid,  Relief  and  Economic 
Security (CARES) Act, including developing new tools and meaningful guidance 
to deliver the first round of EIPs in record time. In fact, millions of Americans started 
seeing EIPs show up in their banking accounts within 14 days after the March 27, 
2020 enactment of the CARES Act. IRS employees successfully disbursed more 
than 160 million payments of nearly $275 billion in this first round of EIPs. 
 
The IRS also quickly delivered the second round of EIPs included in the Tax Relief 
Act enacted on December 27, 2020. The IRS disbursed approximately 147 million 
payments totaling about $142 billion and in many cases, these payments started 
posting to bank accounts just two days after the law’s enactment. IRS employees 
worked nonstop through the holidays to get these payments out, while remaining 
hard at work preparing for the 2021 tax filing season. I want to emphasize the 
amount of advance preparation our employees did, once it started to become 
apparent that a second round of payments would be enacted, in order for us to 
achieve such a quick turnaround.  
 
Another factor helping us speed the effort on the second round of EIPs was our 
ability to build off and use the data we had accumulated in delivering the first round. 
  10 
     
 
That accumulation of data again helped us move quickly on delivery of the third 
round of EIPs that began in March. 
 
The vast majority of people did not need to take any action to receive an EIP, either 
in the first or second round, and we have been working to ensure the same is true 
for  the  third  round  of  EIPs.  The  IRS  calculated  and  automatically  sent  the 
payments to taxpayers as well as others  eligible, including many people who may 
not normally need to file returns, such as senior citizens with modest incomes,  
others  receiving  Social  Security  retirement,  survivors  or  disability  insurance 
benefits, and railroad retirees. The IRS also issued EIPs last year to those whose 
only income is from Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits and people 
receiving  disability  compensation,  pension  or  survivor  benefits  from  the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  
 
In our initial work on EIPs during the spring of 2020, the IRS worked cooperatively 
with the Social Security Administration (SSA), the VA, and other government 
agencies to pull these agencies’ information into our systems to ensure that we 
could send payments to these groups of people without requiring them to file a 
return or take any other action. These agencies provided critical help that allowed 
the IRS to reduce the burden for these individuals, including reducing the need for 
them to seek in-person tax return preparation to file a return. This effort was a 
significant step beyond anything the IRS was able to do during previous stimulus 
efforts to help taxpayers. For the first round of EIPs in the spring of 2020, these 
groups received their payments in four to six weeks after the CARES Act was 
signed into law.  
 
Again this year, the IRS began working with the SSA and the VA early on to help 
ensure we could deliver the latest round of EIPs as soon as possible to non-filers 
who receive federal benefits such as those described above. Because information 
about who receives federal benefits changes over time, the IRS needed these 
agencies to provide updated 2021 information, and we requested this information 
as quickly as possible so we could process the beneficiary data and make these 
automatic payments.  
 
For the latest round of EIPs, we have surpassed key milestones in last year’s 
timeframe, and we will continue working to get these payments out to federal 
beneficiaries as soon as possible.  Thus far we have disbursed more than 19 
million EIP3 payments with a total value of more than $26 billion to Retirement, 
Survivors, and Disability Insurance (commonly referred to as “Social Security”) 
program beneficiaries who didn’t file a 2020 or 2019 return and who did not use 
the Non-Filers tool last year. We have also disbursed more than 3 million payments 
to SSI beneficiaries with a total value of nearly $5 billion, and nearly 85,000 
payments with a total value of more than $119 million to Railroad Retirement Board 
beneficiaries. Additionally, we have disbursed more than 320,000 payments, with 
a total value of $450 million, to VA beneficiaries who receive Compensation and 
Pension benefit payments but who don't normally file a tax return. 
  11 
     
 
 
In its efforts last year to quickly deliver EIPs and provide information to eligible 
recipients, the IRS provided two new online tools:  
 
•  The Non-Filers tool, which was launched on IRS.gov on April 10, 2020 and 
available through November 21, 2020 in both English and Spanish, allowed 
people who normally don’t have a filing obligation to enter basic information 
so that they could receive their payment.  
•  The Get My Payment tool, which launched on IRS.gov on April 15, 2020 
and is available in English and Spanish, allows many taxpayers to check 
the status of their payment or enter their bank account information to receive 
their payment electronically, if it was not already provided on a 2019 or 2018 
tax return or through the Non-Filers tool. 
 
Since the launch of Get My Payment, nearly 350 million successful status checks 
have been made using this tool. And nearly 15 million people have successfully 
provided their banking information, meaning they received their payments much 
more quickly via direct deposit.  
  
The IRS has taken significant steps to reach all potential EIP recipients throughout 
each round of EIPs. We extended our reach far beyond our normal contacts to 
many lower-income, military, veterans, retired, older, limited English proficient, and 
homeless communities around the country. In fact, we worked with our partners to 
distribute EIP outreach materials in 35 languages within these communities.  
 
We have continued to ask for assistance from hundreds of local community groups 
and religious organizations, as well as the national associations to which they 
belong, and numerous others to reach into their respective communities. We 
worked  with  thousands  of  homeless  organizations,  including  more  than  300 
organizations that became “Trusted Partners” where an unsheltered homeless 
individual  could  designate  to  receive  their  payment.  We  also  expanded  the 
authority of Low-Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs) to provide return preparation 
assistance for individuals seeking their EIPs. To support these ongoing efforts, we 
developed a special online toolkit containing helpful information for groups to use 
in identifying and getting the word out to people who qualify for EIPs. The toolkit, 
IRS Publication 5420, can be found on IRS.gov. We also provided information 
regarding a similar online toolkit to every member of Congress. 
 
Also as part of this effort, we mailed a letter in September 2020 to millions of 
Americans who might be eligible, but hadn't received an EIP and didn’t file a return 
for either 2018 or 2019. We obtained these names by performing an extensive 
internal analysis of records corresponding to individuals who did not file returns or 
receive federal benefits and were not responsive to other EIP outreach efforts. 
These individuals did not typically have a tax return filing requirement but had 
received Forms W-2, 1099s and other third-party statements. We sent letters to 
these individuals to notify them of their potential eligibility as we lacked information 
  12 
     
 
on: whether they would qualify; whether they had eligible dependents; or whether 
an individual may be ineligible due to being claimed as a dependent by someone 
else. 
 
To help these groups, we extended the initial access to the Non-Filers Tool five 
weeks to November 21, 2020. This new deadline provided additional time for 
individuals to use the tool without adversely affecting our work on the 2021 filing 
season. On November 10 we held National EIP Registration Day (and supported 
other similar events), to encourage people who had not received a payment to use 
the Non-Filers tool before the November 21 deadline. 
 
Our outreach effort during delivery of this third round of EIPs includes reminding 
people who did not receive payments in the first or second rounds last year that, if 
they qualify for them, they can receive those payments by filing a tax return and 
claiming the RRC. We are also encouraging these people, when filing their return, 
to check to see if they qualify to claim other tax credits, including the EITC and the 
CTC.    
 
The IRS has also been providing support to members of Congress who have been 
receiving inquiries from constituents about the payments. To help provide these 
answers,  the  IRS  set  up  a  special  online  “EIP  Mailbox”  last  May  to  which 
congressional staffs could send inquiries. 
 
The EIP Mailbox received more emails than we anticipated, with the number of 
emails averaging 700 a day at first and reaching 1,000 a day by the summer. To 
make sure we helped as many people as possible, we modified our processes and 
temporarily reassigned IRS employees to respond to these inquiries. By the time 
we closed the mailbox in December, we had received a total of more than 130,000 
inquiries and resolved an estimated 90 percent of the questions. To accommodate 
inquiries related to the second round of EIPs, we reopened the EIP mailbox on 
January 11, 2021, and it has remained open since then. Currently, we are receiving 
approximately 150 emails a day. 
 
Implementing Business Tax Relief 
 
Along with EIPs for individuals, the IRS has also been working to make sure 
businesses know about important tax relief available to them, and we continue to 
provide guidance about business tax relief. This assistance was originally provided 
in  COVID-relief  legislation  last  year.  Two  important measures,  the  Employee 
Retention Credit and the Credit for Sick and Family Leave, have already resulted 
in, as of May 3, 2021, credit amounts claimed on returns of more than $18 billion. 
These measures were extended and/or modified by the ARP Act as follows: 
Credit for Sick and Family Leave. Eligible employers are entitled to receive 
a refundable (and advanceable) tax credit for the qualified sick leave and 
family leave they provide to employees dealing with specified health and 
family  issues  related  to  the  coronavirus  between  April  1,  2020,  and 
  13 
     
 
September 30, 2021. The IRS is working to ensure that eligible employers 
(employers  with  fewer  than  500  employees  and  certain  governmental 
employers) know the ARP Act allows them to claim a tax credit for providing 
leave for employees receiving COVID-19 vaccinations and recovering from 
the vaccines.  
 
•  Employee Retention Credit. This refundable credit is designed to encourage 
businesses  to  keep  employees  on  their  payroll.  As  amended  by  the 
American Rescue Plan, the refundable credit is 70 percent of up to $10,000 
in qualified wages per quarter paid by employers financially affected by 
COVID-19. Qualifying wages – including health plan expenses – are those 
paid after June 30, 2021 and before January 1, 2022. The credit was 
modified to include: eligibility for certain startup businesses; special rules 
for “severely financially distressed employers” that experienced a gross 
receipts reduction of more than 90 percent; and a five-year statute of 
limitations for the IRS to make an assessment of any amount attributable to 
the employee retention credit. 
In addition, for the Credit for Sick and Family Leave and the Employee Retention 
Credit, the IRS set up a system that allowed businesses to claim these refundable 
credits in advance during 2020 and thus have more funds available to keep their 
workers employed without having to wait to claim the credits on tax returns filed in 
2021. 
Another important area where Congress provided relief involves net operating 
losses of businesses. The CARES Act includes a provision allowing businesses to 
carry back net operating losses over five years and obtain tax refunds for those 
years. The IRS issued Revenue Procedures 2020-23 and 2020-24 and Notice 
2020-26  to  clarify  this  provision  and  help  businesses  and  partnerships  take 
advantage of the relief it provides. 
. 
Providing Administrative Relief and Protecting Taxpayers 
 
Along  with  implementing  the  CARES  Act,  the  IRS  provided  significant 
administrative relief in 2020 to ease the burden on taxpayers: 
•  A postponement of the deadline for individuals to file federal returns and 
pay federal income tax from April 15, 2020, to July 15, 2020. This relief 
covered all taxpayers with a tax return filing deadline or payment due date 
between April 1, 2020, and July 15, 2020. As noted above, this year we 
provided a more limited extension, applying to individuals filing Form 1040, 
to May 17, 2021. 
•  The IRS People First Initiative, under which we temporarily adjusted our 
processes to help people and businesses during these uncertain times. This 
included limiting certain collection and examination activities. 
 
  14 
     
 
While it has been important to the tax system, and the nation, for the IRS to resume 
its critical tax compliance responsibilities, we continue to assess the wide-ranging 
impacts of COVID-19 and other difficulties people are experiencing. 
 
To that end, the IRS continues to offer a wide range of taxpayer relief options. We 
are:  
•  Doing everything we can under existing rules for immediate, broad-based 
relief from unpaid liabilities resulting from COVID-19 issues, including those 
affected by IRS mail processing and correspondence delays;  
•  Removing bureaucratic barriers and expanding flexibilities to all taxpayers 
whose financial condition has been affected by COVID-19; and 
•  Balancing the relief provided against the need to serve all taxpayers and 
uphold the nation’s tax laws.  
 
When appropriate, the IRS can help taxpayers by abating penalties, extending 
payment plans, expanding access to installment agreements, and providing relief 
for taxpayers having difficulty meeting the terms of previously accepted offers to 
settle tax debts. 
 
Our initiatives offer help in a variety of ways. Taxpayers without income or the 
ability to pay can request a temporary suspension of collection activity through the 
Currently-Not-Collectible program.  Taxpayers with balance due amounts may 
qualify for installment agreement options with generous terms and timeframes, and 
taxpayers with existing Online Payment Agreements, or Direct Debit Installment 
Agreements  can  propose  lower  monthly  payment  amounts  and  update  their 
payment due dates. Other penalty relief options include first-time abatement for 
reasonable cause. 
 
The IRS has also been diligently working to alert taxpayers and tax professionals 
to scams related to COVID-19, especially calls and email phishing attempts tied to 
the EIPs. The IRS and its partners throughout the country have been publicizing 
these scams. 
  
MAINTAINING IRS OPERATIONS DURING COVID-19 
The IRS’s initial efforts to provide relief to taxpayers came during Filing Season 
2020 and at a time when the agency had to temporarily scale back operations to 
protect the health and safety of both IRS employees and taxpayers. Even with our 
reduced operations, the IRS continued to successfully deliver the 2020 filing 
season, by processing electronic tax returns, issuing tax refunds, and accepting 
electronic payments.  
 
During COVID-19, the IRS has been using innovative approaches to make sure 
our employees can deliver on the agency’s mission: 
  15 
     
 
•  We have set records for the number of IRS employees teleworking, thanks 
to the continued support of our Information Technology (IT) division;  
•  Our IT systems continue to perform at a high level. Our internal networks 
are supporting nearly 61,000 employees online at the same time, all in a 
secure environment; 
•  IT provided the equipment necessary to allow thousands of our customer 
service representatives (CSRs) to telework, which gave critical help to the 
IRS in its efforts to resume phone assistance to taxpayers while maintaining 
the safety of employees during the COVID pandemic;  
•  Our external-facing IT systems also continue to work extremely well in a 
time  of  increased  demand,  including  filing  season  systems as  well  as 
IRS.gov tools; and 
•  We have been able to continue bringing on new employees through the use 
of a successful virtual onboarding process. 
 
As part of these efforts, the IRS continues to find ways to provide new virtual 
services and online tools for practitioners to ensure the critical work of the agency 
continues.  
 
Last summer, for example, we moved quickly to shift our Nationwide Tax Forums 
for tax professionals into an all-virtual setup rather than handling these in person 
at locations across the country. And in our 30th year of offering the forums, I’m 
proud  to  report  our  virtual  version  last  year  still  attracted  more  than  10,000 
practitioners from across the country. This summer, we will again offer the Tax 
Forums virtually. 
 
Another great example is our announcement earlier this year that we are giving 
tax professionals a new online option to obtain signatures from individual and 
business clients and submit authorization forms electronically. This option applies 
to Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative, and Form 
8821, Tax Information Authorization. This development is an important first step in 
our ongoing efforts to expand digital options for tax professionals using electronic 
signatures and online uploads. 
 
New options for taxpayers include the launch last year of an electronic filing option 
for those who need to amend their income tax returns. Providing an online filing 
option for the amended individual income tax return – also known as Form 1040-
X – has been an IRS goal for many years and is a major milestone for us. 
Electronically accepting Form 1040-X posed a number of unique challenges, but 
we succeeded thanks to a great deal of hard work by employees across the 
agency.  
 
    Resuming Operations and Answering Taxpayer Needs 
 
Last summer, the IRS began resuming operations for non-portable services, as 
more states and local areas also began reopening. As we have continued our work 
  16 
     
 
during this unusual period, we have been aware of the continuing taxpayer needs 
and the backlog of work at our campus. We are investing in our Human Capital 
Office to ensure that we can hire the necessary taxpayer service personnel in our 
priority areas. 
 
One area we have worked hard to improve upon is opening the mail. Because we 
had to scale back mail-processing functions last spring due to the pandemic, we 
developed a backlog of unprocessed paper returns and other mail. At one point, 
the backlog reached more than 20 million pieces. But since last summer, we have 
been working through this backlog, and we are now current.  
 
While working to reduce the paper backlog, we also have provided relief for 
taxpayers who sent us mail that was unopened for a period of time. For example: 
•  For people who had tax refunds affected by our closure, the IRS has paid 
interest on refunds. These payments, which can sometimes show up as a 
second deposit, averaged $18 for nearly 14 million taxpayers. 
•  For people who made a payment but where there was a delay in when the 
mail was opened, we credited people on the date the mail was received, not 
the day we processed the payment. 
 
As difficult as these last months have been, we have seen many examples of how 
this crisis has brought out the best in people, including the IRS workforce. I am 
proud  of  what  our  employees  have  accomplished  during  the  pandemic.  Our 
employees shared the same health and safety concerns for themselves and their 
families as every other American. However, they not only went the extra mile in 
doing their jobs; they also made a difference in their communities.  
 
For example, we saw IRS employees across the country doing some amazing 
things: getting out their sewing machines and creating homemade face masks for 
family members and friends; donating essentials to protect first responders on the 
front lines in their communities; and delivering “care packages” to seniors in 
nursing homes. During last summer’s Feds Feed Families Campaign, employees 
at our Memphis Campus donated a record-breaking 51,800 pounds of food to the 
Mid-South Food Bank!  
 
Another good example of providing help during the pandemic involved our Criminal 
Investigation division. A group of 12 special agents deployed to Travis Air Force 
Base in Fairfield, California, in March 2020. They helped provide security and 
quarantine  enforcement  at  hospitals  and  other  locations,  such  as  COVID-19 
quarantine sites operated by the Department of Health and Human Services (the 
Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention). 
 
It is important to note that, in addition to their efforts during the pandemic, IRS 
employees routinely deliver in times of need for the nation when disasters strike. 
Since 2012, more than 10,000 IRS phone assistors have stepped up to help take 
  17 
     
 
the burden off the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) call centers 
in the aftermath of hurricanes and other natural disasters, answering an estimated 
1.6 million calls from storm survivors seeking help. We have also had many agents 
from our Criminal Investigation division provide their help and expertise during 
disasters. For example, in September 2020, a team of about two dozen special 
agents deployed to Oregon in support of those fighting wildfires in that state. More 
recently IRS phone assistors were called upon to be ready to help FEMA with 
respect to the weather-related difficulties in Texas. 
 
 
ENSURING TAX COMPLIANCE 
 
Enforcement activities of the IRS affect revenues directly, through the collection of 
unpaid taxes, and indirectly, by influencing taxpayers’ behavior. Nearly all of the 
IRS’s funds are appropriated annually by Congress. Appropriations for the IRS fell 
by about 20 percent (adjusted for inflation) since FY 2010. About 70 percent of the 
IRS’s overall budget is for labor, and thus the decline in the overall IRS budget 
resulted in a  15 percent decline in the number of full-time employees at the agency 
(since FY 2010) and a 31 percent decline in the number of full-time employees 
working in enforcement roles (since FY 2010). The number of examining revenue 
agents, who handle complex enforcement cases, fell by 35 percent, and field 
collection revenue officers, who manage difficult collections cases, dropped by 48 
percent. The loss of approximately 17,436 enforcement employees since 2010 has 
resulted in the examination rate for individual returns falling by about 45 percent; 
for businesses with assets equal to or exceeding $10 million, the examination rate 
fell by about 72 percent.  
 
Despite these resource challenges, the IRS remains committed to having a strong, 
visible, robust tax enforcement presence to support voluntary compliance. When 
taxpayers file their returns, they should feel confident others are doing the right 
thing too. Enforcement of the tax laws is critical to ensuring fairness in our tax 
system. IRS employees who collect taxes, audit returns and investigate fraud, as 
well as tax-related identity theft, work hard throughout the year to enforce the tax 
laws while treating taxpayers fairly and respecting their rights. This commitment is 
true across our agency – our divisions that deal with individuals, large businesses, 
small businesses and exempt organizations are highly coordinated.  In fact, the 
IRS’s Office of Fraud Enforcement (OFE), which was created in March 2020, is 
actively  encouraging  and  ensuring  this  coordination  across  IRS,  promoting 
compliance, strengthening the IRS’ response to fraud and mitigating emerging 
threats.   
 
Over the past two years, we have shifted significant examination resources and 
technology to increase our focus on high-income and high-wealth taxpayers. For 
example, an IRS initiative announced last year involves improving tax compliance 
among high-income taxpayers by increasing visits to those generally with incomes 
above  $100,000  who  failed  to  file  tax  returns  in  2018  or  previous  years. 
  18 
     
 
Substantially all experienced examiners – those who are the most highly trained 
with substantial accounting skills – are almost entirely focused on tax returns that 
include complex issues, such as high-income taxpayers, pass-through entities, 
multi-national taxpayers involving international tax issues, large pension plans, 
private foundations and the most egregious situations.  
 
As reported in the IRS’s  2019 Data Book, the exam coverage rate (closed and in-
process) for Tax Year 2015 of taxpayers with income of $10 million or more was 
about  8.16  percent  (down  from  almost  23.06  percent  in  2010).  The  rate  for 
taxpayers with income between $5-10 million was 4.39 percent; for those with 
income between $1-5 million was about 2.39 percent; for those with income 
between $500,000- $1 million was about 1.13 percent; and for those with income 
between $200,000-$500,000 was about 0.55 percent. The IRS receives more 
third-party information (Forms W-2s, Forms 1099, etc.) for taxpayers with income 
between $200,000-$1 million than for those above $1 million. These audit rates 
are higher than for any other category of individual filers. We expect to see that 
trend generally continue with Tax Years 2016, 2017, and 2018.  
 
We also have new compliance programs addressing virtual currency (non-filers 
and filers), return preparer non-filers, those who fail to file Form 8300, Report of 
Cash Payments Over $10,000, and others. These programs require experienced, 
specialized examiners  
 
Along with launching our OFE, where technical advisors provide fraud policy and 
operations support to all IRS operations, we also created an Office of Promoter 
Investigations (OPI) within the past year. OPI is focused on taxpayers and the 
promoters of abusive tax avoidance transactions, including abusive syndicated 
conservation easements and abusive micro-captive insurance arrangements, as 
well as the use of virtual currencies, offshore transactions and other transactions 
to inappropriately avoid or under-report tax. Substantially all of these transactions 
are  engaged  in  by  high-income  individuals.  OPI  coordinates  Service-wide 
enforcement  activities,  most  often  interacting  with  our  Large  Business  & 
International division, our Small Business/Self-Employed division, OFE, the Office 
of Chief Counsel and our Criminal Investigation division. 
 
We are also investing in our Human Capital Office to ensure that we can hire the 
necessary enforcement and related personnel in our priority areas, such as the 
oversight of large corporations, partnerships and other pass-through entities, and 
high income/high wealth taxpayers. 
  
The IRS is committed to pursuing those who would intentionally evade their tax 
obligations and commit fraud. We are also pursuing those who promote and make 
use of abusive tax shelters, and are especially concerned about certain variations, 
including  abusive  syndicated  conservation  easements  and  micro-captive 
insurance shelters. The IRS Office of Chief Counsel, which appointed a National 
Fraud Counsel last year, is working closely with IRS compliance officers to properly 
  19 
     
 
and fully develop cases with indicators of fraud across all operating divisions, in 
pursuit  of a  civil  fraud  penalty  where  appropriate, or for  the most  egregious 
violations, a criminal fraud referral. Our Criminal Investigation division also does 
important work to uncover tax fraud, 
 
Additionally, the IRS – in  particular, the OFE and the National Fraud Counsel – 
has been focused on preventing COVID-19-related fraud and scams, working 
closely with the Small Business Administration, the Bureau of Fiscal Service and 
the Department of Justice to prevent and stop improper claims for tax credits and 
see that the unscrupulous individuals face appropriate civil and criminal sanctions. 
 
Importantly, the IRS is using technology to develop new enforcement tools. Our 
advanced data and analytic strategies allow us to catch instances of tax evasion 
that would not have been possible just a few years ago.  We also recognize that 
we must evolve our enforcement efforts to address new types of tax fraud and 
criminal behavior. For example, the IRS has been working to ensure taxpayers 
with  virtual  currency  transactions  understand  the  tax  laws  governing  virtual 
currency and meet their tax obligations. Our Criminal Investigation Cyber Crimes 
Unit has been involved in new complex types of tax enforcement, including: taking 
down the largest child exploitation site operating in the Dark Net utilizing virtual 
currencies; uncovering international money laundering operations involving the 
theft of virtual currencies; and the seizure of terrorism financing sites maintained 
on behalf of al Qaeda, Hamas, and ISIS.  
 
 
TAXPAYER FIRST ACT: UPDATE ON IMPLEMENTATION 
 
Even during this challenging period, the IRS is meeting not only the immediate 
needs of taxpayers but is also developing an innovative approach to the future of 
tax administration that will better serve everyone, including those in underserved 
communities. 
 
The IRS is using its implementation of the Taxpayer First Act (TFA), to make 
significant improvements in the way we serve taxpayers, enforce the tax laws in a 
fair and impartial manner, and ensure our workforce collaborates and is well-
trained. In January, pursuant to the statutory requirement, we submitted our TFA 
Report to Congress. This report includes strategic recommendations to improve 
the taxpayer experience, employee training, and the current agency organizational 
structure. The report is the culmination of input and feedback from our employees, 
our partners in the tax community, and other stakeholders. 
 
I’m pleased to report that we will have strong, experienced leaders guiding us in 
our efforts to improve the taxpayer experience: 
•  Heather Maloy, a former IRS executive, has returned to the agency to be 
the  new  director  of  the  Taxpayer  First  Act  Office.  Heather  held  many 
  20 
     
 
prominent positions while at the IRS, including Commissioner of our Large 
Business and International Division.  
•  Just two weeks after issuing the Report to Congress, we announced the 
creation of the Chief Taxpayer Experience Officer position to unify and 
expand efforts across the agency to serve taxpayers. We selected Ken 
Corbin, the Commissioner of our Wage and Investment Division, for this 
role. With more than three decades at the IRS, Ken Corbin is ideally suited 
to lead our efforts to improve interactions with the IRS for taxpayers and the 
tax professional community. 
 
As we move forward on TFA implementation, our Enterprise Case Management 
initiative (ECM) is a major part of our Integrated Modernization Business plan and 
is a critical component in the implementation of long-term TFA changes. ECM will 
allow us to modernize key IRS business processes and migrate them to a common 
case management platform. This in turn will allow us to decommission as many 
legacy components and systems as possible. For our employees, implementing 
ECM  will  mean  giving  them  appropriate  access  to  a  360-degree  view  of  a 
taxpayer’s account and also support our ability to give taxpayers more digital 
options in their interactions with us. The employees who interact with taxpayers 
are helping to develop features and services that will best help their customers, 
and they have been the key to the success of ECM thus far. 
 
The Tax Exempt/Government Entities Division’s (TE/GE) Exempt Organizations 
Correspondence Unit process was the first business process to migrate to our new 
ECM platform in 2020. This milestone transitioned paper-based processes to an 
electronic format that enabled the Correspondence Unit to work more efficiently, 
speeding up the response time to organizations that interact with TE/GE. The 
lessons learned while migrating this business process to ECM will allow us to build 
on this initial success and migrate other business processes quickly and efficiently 
in  the  coming  years. We  are  currently  working  on  migrating  the  IRS  Grants 
Management program in time to award grants under the new system in 2021 to 
organizations participating in the VITA and TCE programs. 
Our progress thus far on implementation of the TFA shows how committed IRS 
employees are to serving the nation. With our TFA Report guiding us, and with 
ongoing  support  and  feedback  from  our  employees  and  partners  in  the  tax 
community, we will continue to make improvements to ensure the IRS can serve 
the needs of the nation’s taxpayers well into the future. 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Chairman  Van  Hollen,  Ranking  Member  Hyde-Smith  and  Members  of  the 
Subcommittee,  thank  you  again  for  the  opportunity  to  update  you  on  IRS 
operations,  especially  our  responses  to  the  COVID-19  situation.  The  IRS  is 
dedicated  to  improving  service  to  taxpayers,  modernizing  its  systems  and 
  21 
     
 
maintaining the integrity of the tax system, while also protecting the health of its 
workers and American taxpayers.  
 
We believe we have made great strides over the past year and will continue this 
progress with the help of Congress, as we move the agency into the future. This 
concludes my statement, and I would be happy to take your questions.

STATEMENT OF 
MR. JAMES ARTHUR JEMISON II 
PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR COMMUNITY PLANNING 
AND DEVELOPMENT, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN 
DEVELOPMENT 
BEFORE THE 
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, SUBCOMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION, 
HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES 
U.S. SENATE 
 
MAY 19, 2021 
 
Introduction 
 
Every year, millions  of people across the country are affected by natural disasters. Disasters can 
have wide-ranging  impacts, from physical injury and even death to loss of home, property, and 
community.  Across the country, American families are struggling  to recover from natural 
disasters ranging from hurricanes, floods, and landslides  to extreme heat and wildfires. Last year, 
the country set an ominous record: 22 disasters that each caused $1 billion  or more in damage. 
This broke the previous record of 16 events that occurred in both 2011 and 2017. 
 
The science is clear. Climate change is making many of these disasters more frequent and 
intense. As the most recent National Climate Assessment documented, climate-related risk is 
rapidly increasing. These risks are compounded where there is aging infrastructure and as our 
population  becomes more urbanized, and as growth continues along the nation’s coastlines. 
Essential local and regional infrastructure systems (e.g., water, energy, and transportation) are 
interdependent and increasingly  disrupted by the effects of climate change. For example, heavy 
downpours, which are increasing nationally,  can overwhelm combined sewer systems, where 
storm water runoff is combined with sewage from homes and businesses. During intense 
rainstorms, sewage can overflow into rivers, roads, and homes.  
 
The National Climate Assessment has also documented that climate change disproportionately 
impacts older adults, children,  low-income communities,  and some communities  of color. That is 
because existing social inequities  are exacerbated by the impacts of natural disasters. These 
adverse impacts are felt across the country in urban, rural and coastal communities  from 
hurricanes and tropical storms that ravage the eastern seaboard and gulf coast to flooding  in the 
upper Mississippi  River basin and Ohio River basin. 
 
We face a profound climate crisis and have a narrow moment to pursue action to avoid the most 
catastrophic impacts of that crisis and seize the opportunity  that climate change represents. As 
the President has stated, “we must listen to the science and meet the moment.”  
 
The President signed Executive Order 14008, “Tackling  the Climate Crisis at Home and 
Abroad,” on January 27, 2021. In this Executive Order the President recognized this crisis and 
charged his Administration  with implementing  a Government-wide  approach to reduce climate 
pollution  and increase resilience to the impacts of climate change.  
The Administration  knows that the frequency and severity of disasters will increase due to 
climate change which, in turn, will magnify existing racial and socioeconomic  gaps. As the 
Administration  implements the policy  goals articulated in Executive Orders “Advancing Racial 
Equity and Support for Underserved Communities  Through the Federal Government” (EO 
13985) and “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,” (EO 14008) we see an 
opportunity  to coalesce around shared priorities  that will guide Federal disaster recovery 
investment to ensure it is: equitable, fair, and incentivizes  resilient  investment in vulnerable 
communities.  I would like to highlight  each of these priorities:   
Equitable. As part of Executive Order 14008, the Administration  created a government-wide 
Justice40 Initiative with the goal of delivering  40 percent of the overall benefits of relevant 
Federal investments to address the disproportionate  health, environmental,  economic, and 
climate impacts on disadvantaged communities.  Consistent with the EO, Federal disaster 
recovery efforts will be targeted to prioritize  disadvantaged communities,  turning neighborhoods 
that have been historically  marginalized  and overburdened by pollution  and underinvestment  into 
healthy, thriving  communities.   
Fair. The Administration  acknowledges that there are areas that have been and continue to be 
underserved and regions that will be more vulnerable than others to natural disasters. Identifying 
Federal, State and local disaster responsibilities  and resources is key to balanced and fair policies 
that incentivize  and support resilient communities.  A priority would also be to ensure that the 
availability  and eligibility  of Federal programs allows impacted communities  to understand their 
options,  make an informed decision, and build  back resilient to future risks while meeting the 
needs of their community. 
Resilient. People of color and low-income people are more likely to live in areas most vulnerable 
to flooding  and other climate change-related weather events. They also are less likely  to have the 
funds to prepare for and recover from extreme weather events. The Federal government will 
support community  engagement, as well as proactively invest in planning  and resources for more 
comprehensive community-based  disaster resilience, and will build back infrastructure, including 
housing,  to above existing codes and standards after disasters. 
Given the increasing severity and frequency of natural disasters, a coordinated,  whole-of- 
government approach to disaster recovery and response requires a permanent and reliable 
framework.  HUD is uniquely  positioned  to carry out these priorities  as we work with Congress 
to define HUD’s role in disaster recovery through the Community  Development Block Grant – 
Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program, building  on lessons learned from the existing approach 
of ad hoc supplemental appropriations  Acts.  
 
 
Current CDBG-DR Lessons 
HUD is currently managing over $67 billion  in active CDBG disaster recovery grants, supporting 
communities  across the country from Hawaii to Puerto Rico, North Dakota to Louisiana,  and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands to California. In fact, every State represented by members of this 
subcommittee has had a CDBG-DR grantee in their State. In total, funds appropriated in 
supplemental  appropriations  for disaster recovery exceed the annual budget of the Department. 
We welcome opportunities  to strengthen their effectiveness. 
 
I also want to highlight  the Department’s longstanding  and ongoing  relationship  with the U.S. 
Governmental  Accountability  Office (GAO). The Department takes the work of the GAO to 
heart; GAO reports on better monitoring  of CDBR-DR grants have led us to strengthen our 
reviews of grantee submissions  and improve guidance to our grant managers. The GAO’s recent 
report on fraud risk management appropriately  recognizes steps HUD has taken to combat fraud 
in the use of CDBG-DR funds, but also calls for a broader fraud risk assessment an approach on 
which HUD has begun preliminary  work. The GAO report on the need for improved 
coordination  among Federal agencies in our efforts to restore Puerto Rico’s electrical grid has 
also yielded results, including  joint HUD-FEMA “flex match” guidance.  
 
Disaster Recovery – Looking Forward 
 
In recent years, the Department has played a significant  role in helping  low-income communities 
recover from and build  resilience to natural disasters through CDBG-DR. The CDBG-DR 
program, including  CDBG-Mitigation  investments,  has a unique focus on long-term recovery 
and resiliency efforts targeted to families with low and moderate incomes in the most impacted 
and distressed areas. This focus is unique from other Federal disaster assistance programs 
administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the Small Business 
Administration  (SBA), as well as private insurance. 
While we work with Congress to develop a proposal that reflects the Administration’s  shared 
priorities  for disaster recovery programs and incorporates lessons we have learned from our 
experience in CDBG-DR supplementals,  the Department is developing  a “Universal Notice” that 
will outline standing program requirements and “Allocation  Notices” to provide more clarity and 
transparency to grantees in the interim. However, underlying  any broader proposal are program 
elements that are necessary to address issues with the program’s current structure. The following 
are some highlights: 
Ensure fairness and predictability in allocations. HUD relies on data from FEMA and SBA to 
calculate unmet needs. Under the current structure, the allocation methodology  is specified in the 
notice that is issued after the supplemental  appropriations.  Instead, the formula should be defined 
in regulation,  enabling allocations  to be based on the best available data, on a predictable 
timeline.   
 
Ensure flexibility to allow fungibility across allocations in the same jurisdiction. The current 
program does not allow for funding across multiple  disasters, therefore CDBG-DR funds can be 
used only to recover from the disaster for which funds were appropriated. While Congress has 
provided fungibility  between disaster appropriations  in some supplemental appropriations  Acts, 
 
Congress could include flexibility  to allow funding to be used interchangeably when a 
community  is recovering from multiple  events within  a defined period (for example, 5 years). 
Such flexibility  could lead to better coordination  on large-scale investments and projects (for 
example, nature-based solutions)  and could reduce administrative  burdens for the grantee.   
 
Ensure communities integrate mitigation and resilience measures to recover from the current 
disaster and the next one at the same time. Some CDBG-DR supplementals  involve  two or more 
awards for grantees, the first for unmet needs and a second for mitigation  activities promoting 
resilience. This leads to confusion,  inefficiency,  and delays grantees’ use of CDBG-DR funding. 
Disaster recovery funding  should integrate investments for community resilience (e.g., stronger 
building  codes) to future natural disaster risks from all climate hazards, not only from the current 
disaster, into a single award that includes funding for both unmet needs and mitigation  and 
resilience measures. 
 
Retain broad waiver flexibility. Finally, in CDBG-DR supplementals,  the Department is granted 
broad waiver and alternative requirement authority (except for fair housing,  nondiscrimination, 
labor, and the environment). This authority is instrumental  to providing  grantees the flexibility 
needed to fully recover from disasters, and adapt to specific and novel recovery activities tailored 
to each disaster. 
 
The elements I have outlined  directly address obstacles with the CDBG-DR program as it exists 
currently. HUD seeks a permanent, reliable framework for the future. These elements align with 
current research and approaches as well as consistent with the Administration’s  priorities, 
including  tackling the climate crisis.    
 
Other Efforts Related to Climate Change and Resilience  
 
We must also end the endless cycle of disaster recovery by focusing investment on increasing 
resilience and reducing climate emissions to slow the rate of climate change. The Department’s 
Fiscal Year 2022 Discretionary Request and the President’s American Jobs Plan include critical 
investments along those lines.  
 
HUD has an important role to play in reducing carbon pollution  and fighting  the underlying 
cause of climate change. In fact, HUD spends $6.4 billion  annually  on utilities  in public  and 
assisted housing. Further, HUD’s role in the housing finance market can help move the overall 
market toward more green, healthy, and resilient housing. On average, low-income households 
pay 8.1% of their income on energy costs, compared to 2.3% for market households. Older 
adults also face disproportional  energy burdens. Investments in green building  can lower energy 
costs, provide good-paying  union jobs, and improve building  conditions  in otherwise sub-
standard housing.  
 
HUD’s FY 2022 Discretionary Request addresses climate change on two fronts: both in lowering 
the carbon footprint of HUD’s public and assisted housing  (mitigation),  and at the same time 
helping  the communities  served by HUD programs to better withstand and increase their 
resilience to future disasters (adaptation). The Budget requests $800 million  for targeted 
investments to improve the quality of housing  through climate resilience and energy efficiency. 
 
As part of the Administration’s  whole-of-government  approach to the climate crisis, the 
Department is committed to expanding energy efficient and climate-resilient  housing options in 
public and assisted housing. Funds will  be used for initiatives  that align with or are structured 
within existing programs.  
 
HUD provides rental assistance to approximately  4.6 million  households and plays a key role in 
the development and preservation of affordable housing through a wide range of programs. 
HUD’s annual outlay on utility  expenditures (energy and water) for the existing housing  stock 
consume more than 10% of the agency’s total budget and represent an estimated 13.6 million 
metric tons of carbon emissions. Improving  the energy performance (through on-site generation 
and storage, for example) of HUD assets will play a significant  role in reducing these outlays and 
lowering carbon emissions. 
 
American Jobs Plan 
 
As described before, communities  across the country have witnessed a historic number of 
deadly and destructive weather and climate events in the last 10 years.  
 
To address these risks, the American Jobs Plan includes funding for a new Community 
Development Block Grant program for resilience activities in communities  vulnerable to climate 
change. HUD would target funding  to low-and-moderate income areas with increased risk from 
climate related disasters. These investments are intended to focus on housing  and housing-related 
resilient infrastructure to complement the FEMA BRIC program. This program would build on 
prior community-scale  resilience programs that HUD has administered in the past—the National 
Disaster Resilience Competition,  Rebuild by Design, and CDBG-Mitigation  programs. The 
program could also benefit from ongoing interagency collaboration  that has taken place among 
the Department of Energy (DOE), FEMA and EPA in recent CDBG-DR work. 
 
Conclusion  
 
Climate change is here. The time to act is now. As the President has stated we must deploy the 
full capacity of government to combat this crisis. The Department has an important role to play 
in reducing climate pollution  and building  the resilience of communities  for future disasters. We 
look forward to working with Congress to maximize  HUD’s expertise to ensure a reliable, 
whole-of-government  approach to support the long-term recovery of communities  devastated by 
natural disasters.  "

WRITTEN STATEMENT BY 
 
GENERAL DANIEL HOKANSON 
CHIEF, NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU 
 
 
 
BEFORE THE 
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE 
SUBCOMITTEE ON DEFENSE 
 
 
FIRST SESSION, 117th CONGRESS 
ON 
THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE 
 
 
MAY 18, 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
NOT FOR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION 
UNTIL RELEASED BY THE 
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE 
       
 
2022 National Guard Bureau Posture Statement 
 
The National Guard is a lethal, cost-effective, dual-role operational force that 
provides strategic depth to the Army, Air Force, and Space Force, and responds to 
crises in our homeland.  We are capable of operating in a complex global security 
environment and continue to invest in modernization and readiness to prepare for 
the threats of the future.  Today’s National Guard is an integral part in addressing 
the gravest challenges facing the Joint Force.   
Globally, China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and violent extremist organizations 
continue to present significant threats to U.S. prosperity and security.  At home, 
our adversaries use of cyber-attacks and disinformation threaten our democracy 
while the growing frequency and severity of hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and a 
global pandemic challenge the safety of our citizens and communities. 
The year 2020 was unprecedented and historic. National Guard members supported 
every Combatant Commander around the globe and met every mission here at 
home.  On June 6, 120,000 National Guard Soldiers and Airmen were mobilized in 
support of overseas and domestic missions, one of the highest levels of National 
Guard support to our nation since World War II.   
Given the uncertain future and budget priorities, we expect the Department of 
Defense to rely on the National Guard more, not less.  Therefore, we must be ready 
to execute our three core missions: fighting America’s wars; securing the 
homeland; and building enduring partnerships that support our nation’s strategic 
objectives. Continued investment in the National Guard ensures we can meet 
today’s demands while preserving the capability, capacity and deterrence our 
nation needs against a broad spectrum of potential future threats. 
 
WARFIGHT 
The National Guard is the primary combat reserve of the Army and Air Force, and 
provides operational capability to the Space Force.  We provide enduring, 
rotational, surge, and follow-on forces to meet any Joint Force mission.   Today, 
thanks to the substantial investment in training, equipment and readiness by 
Congress and DOD leaders, we have become the most capable, professional, ready, 
and combat proven National Guard in the history of the United States.   
       
 
In 2020, Soldiers with the North Carolina Army National Guard’s 30th Armored 
Brigade Combat Team, who tested their combat skills at the National Training 
Center in 2019, returned from their deployment to Kuwait and Syria and began 
supporting their communities COVID-19 response efforts and civil disturbance 
missions. Also in 2020, the Idaho Air National Guard’s 124th Fighter Wing 
deployed their A-10s and Airmen to the region as well.  The 124th’s deployment, 
the wing’s second-largest ever, required pilots, security forces, maintainers, 
medical personnel, special warfare tactical air controllers and staffers to support 
operations across two continents.    
The National Guard is also a trusted space and cyber partner. For 25 years, 
National Guard space units have provided operational, unit-equipped, surge-to-war 
capability to protect our nation’s vital interests in this contested domain and today 
supply the Space Force with 11 percent of its space professionals and 60% of 
offensive Electronic Warfare capability.  In addition, our cyber warriors bring their 
military and civilian skillsets to bear in support of Cyber Command’s global 
commitments.   
Two decades of investment and modernization in the National Guard has paid 
measurable dividends to our Joint Force’s lethality and our nation’s security.   
 
HOMELAND 
Unique to the National Guard is our ability to apply the training and equipment 
from our wartime missions to our state responses in the homeland. National Guard 
Soldiers and Airmen logged over 10.9 million days serving our communities in 
2020 —more than four times as many as 2019.   
The events of 2020 required an unprecedented response to various unforeseen 
events within the homeland.  Most significantly, the men and women of the 
National Guard served more than 7.6 million days in support the COVID-19 
pandemic – a mission that continues today. They provided over 632 million meals 
to neighbors, distributed over 539 million pieces of Personal Protective Equipment 
(PPE) to essential workers, and tested or screened over 16.1 million people for the 
virus across the 50 states, 3 territories and the District of Columbia in 2020.  In 
addition, they were called to fight record wildfires in California with specially 
equipped C-130s, helicopters, MQ-9 drones and shovels; expedited recovery 
efforts after a record number of named hurricanes battered the Gulf Coast; and 
       
 
provided support to cyber security, cyber assurance and recovery from cyber-
attacks at the local, state, and federal levels.  
In 2021, your National Guard is making concerted efforts to assist in logistics, 
distribution, and vaccination of the communities they serve. To date, Guard 
Soldiers and Airmen have vaccinated millions of civilians, administering well over 
150,000 shots a day – with those numbers continuing to grow. 
The National Guard’s skills and abilities developed for the warfight (such as 
leadership, training, logistics, and communications), coupled with its unique array 
of authorities and trusted local, state, and federal partnerships, makes it a natural 
choice for tackling some of the most difficult challenges we face at home.     
 
PARTNERSHIPS  
Building enduring partnerships at the international, federal, state, and local levels 
contributes to our nation’s strength and readiness.  Our approach makes the 
National Guard a force other nations and organizations are eager to partner with. 
At the international level, the National Guard’s State Partnership Program (SPP) is 
a key pillar to the Department of Defense’s focus on alliances and partnerships.  
Through the SPP, the National Guard maintains long-term relationships that 
strengthen alliances, enhance interoperability, reassure allies and deter our 
adversaries.  Improving the military, security and emergency response capacity of 
partner nations improves their resiliency, benefiting the entire international 
community.  Through 82 SPP partnerships, the National Guard is engaged with 89 
nations, 45% of the world’s nations, and ensures the Department of Defense has 
capable, trusted and interoperable partners at our side. 
At the federal level, the National Guard maintains productive interagency 
relationships with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Department of 
Homeland Security, Department of Health and Human Services, and U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection that contribute to rapid and unified responses when disasters 
strike. Additionally, the National Guard runs several counterdrug schools that offer 
in-person training courses to federal, state and local law enforcement personnel.  
At the local level, we develop partnerships and connections in the communities we 
serve through efforts such as the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe, and DOD’s 
Innovative Readiness Training (IRT) and STARBASE programs.  Youth 
       
 
ChalleNGe is a community-based program that leads, mentors and trains 16-to-18-
year-old, at-risk youths on values, life skills, education, and the self-discipline 
required to become productive citizens in America’s future.  The IRT program 
connects annual military training opportunities with the needs of disadvantaged or 
remote communities to produce mission-ready forces, civil-military partnerships 
and strong communities. The STARBASE program also exposes our nation’s most 
underrepresented youths to activities in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
Math (STEM) career fields through a hands-on learning experience at National 
Guard and other DOD installations across the nation.  
 
CHIEF, NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU 
As the 29th Chief of the National Guard Bureau and member of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, I provide input into every decision impacting our Joint Force and advise the 
Secretary of Defense on all matters involving the National Guard and the 
capabilities the National Guard of the 50 states, 3 territories, and District of 
Columbia provide the Joint Force.  The health and welfare of our service members 
is fundamental to these capabilities, and it’s imperative we continue to provide our 
Soldiers, Airmen, space professionals, families and civilians access to the 
resources needed to maintain their resilience. Maintaining the welfare of our force 
also means ensuring our organization continues to promote inclusion, equality, 
diversity and resilience, with zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or 
discrimination. Finally, we cannot lose sight of the importance of our employers.  
Employers are critical to the success of our part-time business model and we must 
continue to foster an employer-service member relationship that is sustainable and 
mutually beneficial.   
 
Today’s leaders will have to contend with budget pressures, training shortfalls, 
time constraints and modernization gaps. We must develop leaders capable of 
performing at today’s pace of change; redefine how we train forces and approach 
readiness; and seek to become more joint and multi-domain minded. This is critical 
as we look to normalize the capabilities of an operational National Guard within 
the DOD’s processes.  
My goal over the next four years is to build on past National Guard 
accomplishments and contributions to the Joint Force in achieving National 
Defense Strategy objectives through a continued focus on our three core missions 
of warfight, homeland and partnerships. I intend to build a sustainable operational 
       
 
force for the future by focusing on four priorities: people, readiness, modernization 
and reform.  Today’s National Guard is the most modern, ready and interoperable 
Joint Force in our 384-year history.  However, our adversaries do not rest. We 
must continue to build a National Guard that is stronger and more responsive, one 
with greater lethality, global influence and the combat readiness to deter 
aggression.   
 
ALWAYS READY, ALWAYS THERE 
Serving with the 443,000 men and women of the National Guard is an honor. We 
provide combat-proven forces when needed and tirelessly help our communities 
where we live. We stand ready to face the threats of today, and prepare for the 
challenges of tomorrow. Serving in nearly every zip code, and answering the call 
in nearly every corner of the globe, the National Guard remains Always Ready, 
Always There!

Senate Committee on Appropriations 
Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee Hearing 
“Transportation Infrastructure Resilience: Investing in the Future” 
May 13, 2021 
Testimony of U.S. Department of Transportation Deputy Secretary Polly 
Trottenberg 
  
Chairman Schatz, Ranking Member Collins, and Members of the 
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am eager to 
speak with you about how the Department of Transportation’s policies 
and approaches enhance infrastructure resilience and how the 
President’s American Jobs Plan will help us create stronger, more 
resilient transportation infrastructure. 
 
The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes that climate change is 
here and demands a national response. Wildfires, droughts, floods, and 
other high-impact weather events have become more and more common. 
They have destroyed communities, damaged infrastructure, and claimed 
lives. And the cost has been staggering. In 2020 alone, the U.S. suffered 
22 high-impact weather disasters that each cost at least $1 billion in 
damages. 
 
1 
 
Meanwhile, rising sea levels are dramatically eroding our 
coastlines in many places, putting communities and vital infrastructure 
at risk.  Our seaports and coastal airports face storm surges, chronic 
flooding, and the risk of permanent inundation. Crucial transportation 
hubs in states like Hawaii and Louisiana are at severe risk.  
 
When Superstorm Sandy charged up the Atlantic Coast in the fall 
of 2012, it brought a record-setting storm surge that pummeled coastal 
communities large and small. Sandy destroyed homes and businesses, 
left millions without power, and cost our nation tens of billions.  
  
When I became the Commissioner of the New York City 
Department of Transportation in 2014, I inherited a recovery still very 
much in process and witnessed the devastation wrought by a storm of 
that size and power, and the enormous challenges of building back 
critical infrastructure in a dense urban environment that can withstand 
future weather and climate disasters.  
 
We have seen similar destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey in 
2017, the California wildfires in 2020, the winter ice storm in Texas just 
a few months ago, and the January collapse of Highway 1 in Big Sur, 
California, caused by heavy rain and storm debris, along with many, 
many more events.  We are still rebuilding and learning from those 
2 
 
disasters.  They have taught us that if we want to protect the public, 
prevent damage and disruption, and save taxpayer dollars, we must 
proactively incorporate resilience into our transportation infrastructure, 
rather than turn to federal emergency relief funds for repairs after the 
damage has already been done.   
 
Today, I would like to talk to you about the actions we are taking 
at DOT on climate change and resilience to protect our nation’s 
infrastructure, and how the American Jobs Plan can help us do even 
more. 
 
At DOT, we are supporting the President’s aggressive goal of net-
zero emissions by 2050 by investing in and accelerating a shift to clean 
transportation, including clean transit, trains, airplanes, ships, and 
vehicles, as well as making walking and biking safer and easier.  
Furthermore, we have developed four key strategies to make our 
infrastructure more resilient.  
 
1) We can build stronger or better, or retrofit existing infrastructure to 
prepare for and adapt to changes in the climate, incorporating 
nature-based strategies that can help protect transportation 
infrastructure – such as constructed marshes to protect coastal 
highways –wherever possible.  
3 
 
2) We can add redundancy and efficiency to the transportation 
network by building new links, multimodal hubs, or routes. 
3) We can relocate transportation assets to less vulnerable, but still 
well-connected, locations. 
4) And, lastly, we can use more intensive maintenance or operational 
strategies to help address disruptions. 
 
In addition, the Federal Highway Administration and Federal 
Transit Administration both offer emergency relief programs that are a 
valuable tool for communities. These programs have provided over $15 
billion for highways since 2005 and $11 billion for transit since 2013 to 
rebuild transportation assets following a declared disaster.  The 
Department has worked closely with your states and transit agencies to 
get resources and aid on the ground quickly. We encourage agencies to 
take advantage of every opportunity to use these funds to build back 
better and stronger infrastructure. We recognize how important these 
programs are for many of you here, and we want to make sure that we 
are effectively collaborating with you. 
 
But we also want to proactively avoid damage by building resilient 
infrastructure. We are partnering with State, local, and Tribal agencies to 
evaluate the climate vulnerabilities of their transportation assets. We are 
piloting tools and metrics for resilience, like DOT’s “Resilience and 
4 
 
Disaster Recovery Tool Suite,” which will help state and local agencies 
incorporate resilience into their planning. And we are working with our 
partners to tailor resilience options to each transportation facility. 
 
However, disaster recovery and resilience efforts will require more 
resources as weather and climate disasters become ever more 
frequent. The President’s American Jobs Plan is a chance to jump-start 
our efforts to make transformational investments in projects and 
approaches that build resilience. One highlight of the plan is a $50 
billion investment in infrastructure resilience across a range of sectors, 
including transportation. We look forward to working with you to make 
sure that these investments meet community needs.  
 
The Plan also allocates $115 billion for a “fix it right” approach to 
repairing our highways, bridges, and main streets. The Plan will 
decrease vehicle-produced greenhouse gas emissions by investing $85 
billion in transit and $80 billion in rail, as well as $174 billion to support 
the nationwide adoption of electric vehicles. It calls for $25 billion for 
our airports, including funding for the Airport Improvement Program 
and upgrades to FAA assets, and $17 billion for inland waterways and 
ports. Additionally, the plan provides $20 billion to improve road safety 
for all users, including increases to existing safety programs and a new 
Safe Streets for All program to fund state and local “vision zero” plans 
5 
 
and other improvements to reduce crashes and fatalities, especially for 
cyclists and pedestrians. 
 
Furthermore, the Plan will improve equity by ensuring that at least 
40% of the benefits of climate investments flow to underserved 
communities, who bear disproportionate impacts of transportation 
pollution and are more vulnerable to negative effects of climate change.  
 
In totality, we believe the American Jobs Plan could be a 
transformational investment in making the U.S. transportation system 
more resilient and environmentally sustainable.  
 
The AJP also makes financial sense. Investing in infrastructure that 
can’t withstand climate change is just throwing good money after bad. 
And research indicates that the financial benefits of resilience far 
outweigh the costs. The National Institute of Building Sciences found 
that for every dollar of federal mitigation grants we spend to avoid 
disasters before they happen, we save six dollars.  
Investing in a more sustainable, equitable transportation system 
will create jobs and new American industries and will help us tackle 
climate change, improve safety, and increase quality of life, especially 
for those most negatively impacted over the past decades. But 
addressing resilience requires more than money. It requires an 
6 
 
interdisciplinary effort to address challenges in science, politics, and 
financing. To succeed, we need to partner with you in Congress; with 
state, local, and tribal transportation leaders; with industry; with 
scientists and researchers; and with local communities.  
I look forward to working with members of the Committee to 
make that possible. Thank you again for the opportunity to appear today. 
I am happy to answer your questions.

Statement of  
Merrick B. Garland 
Attorney General  
Department of Justice  
 
Before the  
Committee on Appropriations  
United States Senate  
 
At a Hearing Entitled  
“Domestic Violent Extremism in America” 
 
Presented  
May 12, 2021 
 
 
Good morning Chairman Leahy, Vice Chairman Shelby, and distinguished Members of 
the Committee.  Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on behalf of the Department of 
Justice.    
 
Combatting domestic violent extremism and domestic terrorism has long been a core 
part of the Justice Department’s mission.  Immediately upon its founding 150 years ago, the 
Department pursued white supremacists who sought to deny newly freed slaves their rights 
under the Constitution, including the right to vote.  Members of the first incarnation of the Ku 
Klux Klan attacked and murdered Black people, assassinated Black political leaders, drove 
Black farmers off their land, and burned their houses and churches.  The Department put its 
energies into combatting the Klan, successfully prosecuting hundreds of Klansmen.   
 
Twenty-six years ago, Timothy McVeigh bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal 
Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children.  Hundreds of others were 
seriously injured.  Last month, I travelled to Oklahoma to speak at the annual memorial 
ceremony.  My trip brought back vivid memories of what I saw when I first arrived on the scene 
26 years ago to lead the Justice Department’s prosecution: It looked like a war zone.  The front 
of the Murrah Building, which had housed a children’s center, was gone.  The parking lot across 
the street still held cars that had been flattened by the blast.  And an army of first responders, 
from across Oklahoma and across the nation, was crawling over the wreckage, sifting through 
the rubble for survivors and the dead.   
 
We promised then that we would find the perpetrators, that we would bring them to 
justice, and that we would do so in a way that honored the Constitution.  The effort required 
unprecedented interagency cooperation at all levels of government, careful management of the 
evidence, and scrupulous adherence to the Constitution and the law.  It also required a major 
commitment of the Department’s resources and personnel to see that justice was done.  
Investigators conducted 28,000 interviews, collected nearly 3.5 tons of evidence, and searched 
through more than one billion pieces of information.  Juries ultimately convicted both McVeigh 
and his co-conspirator, Terry Nichols. 
 
The horror of domestic violent extremism is still with us.  Indeed, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) assesses that “2019 was the deadliest year for domestic violent extremism” 
since 1995.1  And in March, the Intelligence Community (IC), in a report drafted by the 
Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the National Counterterrorism Center under the 
auspices of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, assessed that domestic violent 
extremists “pose an elevated threat” in 2021.2  The IC assessed that “racially or ethnically 
motivated violent extremists and militia violent extremists present the most lethal [domestic 
violent extremist] threats.”3  In the FBI’s view, the top domestic violent extremist threat we face 
comes from “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocate 
for the superiority of the white race.”4  The IC assessed that the militia violent extremist threat 
also “increased last year and that it will almost certainly continue to be elevated throughout 
2021.”5   
 
Many communities have experienced the horror inflicted by this threat over the past 
several years.  In El Paso, 23 people, most of whom were Latino, were gunned down while 
shopping at a Walmart.  In Pittsburgh, eleven Jewish worshippers were shot and killed at their 
synagogue.  In Charleston, nine Black men and women were shot and killed while praying at 
their church. 
 
We have also seen the burning and bombing of places of worship throughout the country, 
as well as other acts of hate-fueled violence that are less likely to make national news but that 
still terrorize entire communities.  In addition to the threat of  racially or ethnically motivated 
violent extremism – and sometimes in conjunction with it – the FBI has highlighted a recent 
increase in attacks perpetrated by those it categorizes as “Anti-Government or Anti-Authority 
Violent Extremists.”6  The Unabomber, whom I also investigated and prosecuted in the mid-
1990s, is perhaps by some measures the most high-profile example of the latter, although (as is 
not infrequently the case) his writings and ideology defy straightforward classification.

And as with the Oklahoma City and Unabomber investigations, the Justice Department 
is once again engaged in a complex and resource-intensive investigation – one of the largest in 
our history – the investigation of the heinous attack on the United States Capitol on January 6th.     
 
While much has changed at the Department of Justice since my last tour of duty, the 
professionalism, commitment, and dedication of the Department’s workforce have remained 
constant.  Every day, Department employees enforce and uphold the rule of law.  Many risk their 
own safety to protect the American public from violent crime or other threats, including those 
perpetrated by domestic violent extremists.  Unfortunately, as the attack on the U.S. Capitol 
underscores, there is still much work to do.   
 
At the Justice Department, we are committed to using every appropriate tool at our 
disposal to deter, disrupt, and punish acts of domestic violent extremism and domestic terrorism.  
This whole-of-Department commitment includes the FBI, the Department’s other law 
enforcement agencies, the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, the National Security Division, the Civil 
Rights Division, the Criminal Division, the Tax Division, our grant-making offices, and our 
other components:  
 
  The FBI is the lead federal law enforcement agency for investigating and preventing 
acts of domestic and international terrorism.  As part of the FBI’s efforts to counter 
terrorism and violent extremism, the FBI has established nearly 200 Joint Terrorism 
Task Forces (JTTFs) across its 56 field offices nationwide.  The JTTFs combine 
specialists from the law enforcement and intelligence communities into a single team 
that can pursue leads, gather evidence, make arrests, and quickly respond to terrorist 
threats and incidents.   
 
  The Department prosecutes violent extremism and terrorism by drawing on the 
capabilities and expertise of our 94 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, the National Security 
Division, the Civil Rights Division, the Criminal Division, and other attorneys across 
the Department.  Each U.S. Attorney’s Office has an Anti-Terrorism Advisory 
Council (ATAC) to coordinate federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial law 
enforcement efforts in its district.   
 
  Through the ATACs and JTTFs, the Department promotes information sharing 
among federal, state, local, Tribal and territorial law enforcement entities.  This 
information sharing is critical because local law enforcement officers may be the first 
to identify individuals planning violent extremist and terrorist acts in their 
communities.  Close cooperation with private-sector partners also provides an 
essential avenue for detecting specific threats that may develop.  Just as important, we 
depend on private citizens to report threats they see around them. 
 
  Through our grant-making components, the Department has funding available to 
address domestic violent extremism and domestic terrorism.  The Department’s 
Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) administers an anti-terrorism program that 
provides technical assistance and training to state, local, Tribal, and territorial law 
3 
 
enforcement partners.  In addition, BJA supports the investigation and prosecution of 
cold case homicide investigations and prosecutions in which the race of the victim 
may have been a factor under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act and 
provides funding to law enforcement for outreach, education, investigation, and 
prosecution of hate crimes.   
 
  The Department’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) also 
funds efforts aimed at preventing domestic violent extremism and domestic terrorism.  
The COPS Office is including combatting hate crimes and domestic extremism as an 
area of special consideration in the 2021 Community Policing Development (CPD) 
Microgrants Program solicitation.  CPD Microgrants Program funds are used to 
develop the capacity of law enforcement to implement community policing strategies. 
 
  The Department is also improving the state of research and analysis in this area.  For 
nearly a decade, the Department’s National Institute of Justice (NIJ) has administered 
a domestic violent extremism and domestic terrorism research program.  Last year, 
NIJ published Understanding Domestic Radicalization and Terrorism: A National 
Issue Within a Global Context, a review of the most up-to date research and an 
analysis that highlighted areas where more work is needed.  In FY 2021, NIJ will 
fund research that focuses on the radicalization process, reintegration of offenders 
incarcerated for terrorism-related offenses, and terrorism prevention programs.  The 
President’s FY 2022 discretionary request includes a $4 million increase for NIJ to 
further research on the root causes of radicalization. 
  
  The Justice Department must also confront the distinct challenges federal prisons 
face.  The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) guards against the spread of violent extremist 
ideologies within federal prisons through a variety of management controls, task force 
collaboration, and staff training.  Appreciating the evolving nature of the threat, BOP 
is currently undertaking a review of its risk-assessment tools, placing renewed focus 
on available programming, and formulating proposals for increased staffing and other 
resources.   
 
  The United States Marshals Service (USMS) also contributes in critical ways to these 
efforts.  As part of its judicial security mission, USMS conducts threat investigations 
and, in appropriate cases, provides protective details for the federal judiciary against 
violent extremist and terrorist threats.  The USMS Investigative Operations Division 
and Special Operations Group work to support USMS’s fugitive apprehension 
mission.   
 
  Another key component within the Department is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), which investigates violations of the federal firearms 
laws, investigates the origin and cause of explosions, and provides support for 
explosives, fire, canine, and response operations through its National Center for 
Explosives Training and Research.  Together with the FBI, ATF jointly manages the 
4 
 
Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center, the interagency organization that 
analyzes all terrorist improvised explosive devices of interest to the United States. 
 
  The Department’s efforts include supporting an interagency, whole-of-government 
approach to these threats.  Department of Justice personnel collaborate on this 
mission on a daily basis with the Department of Homeland Security – working 
closely on everything from aviation and border security, to sharing intelligence on 
emerging threats, to training and engagement with state, local, Tribal, and territorial 
law enforcement. 
 
  Finally, the Department also coordinates the Domestic Terrorism Executive 
Committee (DTEC), a group that provides a forum for information sharing among 
federal agencies at a leadership level.  The DTEC was originally established 
following the Oklahoma City bombing, and its mission and role remain important 
today. 
 
Although this general structure within the Department has long been in place, we are now 
reassessing our existing activities and authorities to ensure that we have the right posture to 
confront the threat of domestic violent extremism and domestic terrorism, are devoting 
appropriate resources to the task, and are nimble enough to make any changes that may be 
necessary to bolster our efforts and adapt as the threat evolves.  This includes dedicating more 
resources as needed; ensuring that we are sharing as much information as we can with federal, 
state, local, Tribal, and territorial partners; deepening collaboration with foreign partners to 
explore any links to the international counterparts of domestic violent extremists; sharing 
information as appropriate with technology companies to help them address the spread of 
domestic violent extremist activity online; and ensuring that we have sufficient training at the 
federal, state, and local levels.  Collaboration within the Department and with our colleagues in 
federal government, the private sector, our foreign partners, and civil society is critical to our 
approach.   
  
The Department of Justice recently issued guidance to all federal prosecutors 
emphasizing the need for coordination and consistency in prosecutions involving domestic 
violent extremism and imposing new requirements for identifying and tracking such matters.  
That guidance and other efforts will strengthen coordination within the Department.  We have 
also been actively engaged with our partners at DHS, in the IC, and throughout relevant parts of 
the federal government, in a 100-day interagency assessment of our whole-of-government efforts 
to counter domestic terrorism, as called for by President Biden.     
 
In the past year, the Justice Department has shifted significant discretionary resources to 
focus on this area.  The President’s discretionary request for FY 2022 seeks to provide over $100 
million in additional funds to address the rising threat of domestic violent extremism and 
domestic terrorism, including funding for the FBI, the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, the U.S. Marshals 
Service, and other components of the Department. 
 
5 
 
The Department’s strong commitment and resolve in this effort has been evident in the 
unprecedented speed and scale of our response to the January 6th attack on the Capitol.  The 
violence we witnessed that day was an intolerable assault not only on the Capitol building and 
the brave law enforcement personnel who sought to protect it, but also on a fundamental aspect 
of our democracy – the peaceful transfer of power.    
 
In response to that attack, the Department has undertaken an extraordinary effort to hold 
accountable those who engaged in criminal acts that day.  In just under 130 days, the Department 
has made more than 430 arrests, and that number continues to grow.  The FBI’s investigations 
span almost the entire country.  The prosecution efforts, which are being led by the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, remain ongoing.    
 
The Justice Department has also focused on countering federal hate crimes.  To address 
the recent rise in hate crimes and hate incidents – particularly the disturbing trend in violence 
against members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community since the start of the 
pandemic – my first directive as Attorney General was to launch an accelerated review of the 
ways in which the Department can enhance its efforts to deter and combat such crimes.  Hate 
crimes have no place in our society, and the Department, led by our Civil Rights Division, is 
committed to prosecuting those who commit them.   
 
In all our efforts to combat these domestic threats, the Justice Department is guided by 
our commitment to protecting civil liberties.  In our country, espousing an extremist ideology is 
not a crime.  Nor is expressing hateful views or associating with hateful groups.   
 
But when someone tries to promote or impose an ideology through acts of violence, those 
acts can be among the most dangerous crimes we confront as a society.  My experience in 
Oklahoma City has seared that point into my mind.  Regardless of the motivating ideology, we 
will use every appropriate tool at our disposal to deter and disrupt such acts and to bring their 
perpetrators to justice.   
 
*  *  * 
 
The Department of Justice is deeply committed to combatting domestic violent 
extremism and domestic terrorism.  We are equally committed to fighting violence and terrorism 
that is directed or inspired by foreign actors – but I recognize that is not the focus of this hearing.  
As to both, we will pursue justice in a manner that honors the civil liberties guaranteed by the 
Constitution and laws of the United States.   
 
Thank you for inviting me to testify at this important hearing.  And thank you for your 
partnership with the Justice Department in ensuring that we have the resources we need to carry 
out this vital mission.

‘Diversifying On-Farm Income: Opportunities to Strengthen Rural America.’ 
Senate Committee on Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration and Related Agencies 
April 29, 2021 
 
Testimony of Mr. Davon Goodwin 
Owner, Off the Land (OTL) Farms 
Director, Sandhills AgInnovation Center 
Board President, National Young Farmers Coalition 
 
Good Morning Committee Chair Senator Tammy Baldwin and Ranking Member Senator 
John Hoeven, the rest of the Committee and Staff. Thank you for this opportunity to share my 
experiences as a young farmer, director of the Sandhills AgInnovation Center in Ellerbe, North 
Carolina, and Board President of the National Young Farmers Coalition. Senator Baldwin, thank 
you specifically for inviting me to bring the young farmer voice to this important conversation 
on diversifying farm income.  
 
My name is Davon Goodwin and I produce muscadine grapes, blackberries, fruit juice, and 
mixed vegetables on 42 acres at OTL Farms (Off the Land Farms) in Laurinburg, North 
Carolina. I am also the director of the Sandhills Ag Innovation Center, a food hub in Ellerbe, 
North Carolina, that is working to reinvigorate the local sustainable farm economy and support 
the next generation of farmers. I serve as Board President of the National Young Farmers 
Coalition because the organization helped me find my voice, share my story, and provided 
essential community while I was starting out as a young farmer. I also serve on the USDA 
Beginning Farmer and Rancher Committee.  
 
I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but have rooted myself in North Carolina for over a 
decade now. I hold a B.S. degree from University of North Carolina at Pembroke where I studied 
Biology with a concentration in botany. While in college, I enlisted in the Army Reserve where I 
served for six years and was deployed to Afghanistan. My truck was hit by an IED (Improvised 
Explosive Device). From the blast, I broke the L1 and L2 in my back and suffered a traumatic 
brain injury. I received a Purple Heart for my service. But after the bomb went off, I thought I 
wouldn’t be able to finish college. I had no reason to live. I was on many drugs to treat my 
injuries, and developed narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming 
daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep. Thankfully, I found the stamina to finish my 
degree. And because I saw agriculture in my community, I thought that this could turn out to be a 
viable option for me in the future. 
 
1 
Since I couldn’t get a job due to my narcolepsy, I volunteered on farms. The owner of Fussy 
Gourmet Farms in Raeford, North Carolina took a chance on me and offered me a farm manager 
position even though I didn’t have experience in production agriculture.  
 
Farming saved my life. Once you put your hands in the dirt, you’ll never be the same 
again. Soil has a healing component that is almost indescribable.  
 
I served as farm manager for four years before starting my own grapes at Fussy Gourmet Farms. 
But unfortunately, they wouldn’t offer me a long-term lease. I planted grapes on that property 
that I will never get to harvest. Leasing land is precarious, especially for perennial agriculture 
such as grape production where you don’t see fruit until year four. I looked for leases on 
different properties, but they would only offer a one-year lease. Because long-term leases like 
10-20 years were not available in my area, I knew that I needed to purchase my own land. I 
couldn’t invest in fruit trees and grapevines without the security that I would be on the land when 
it was time for harvest.  
 
When I got started in farming, no one told me my student loans would be such a hurdle. No one 
talks about student loans at a farm meeting. But the reality is that my student loans were standing 
in the way of my land purchase. Bankers told me that I didn’t have enough farm income to 
purchase a farm. That the only way I could get a land loan would be to have an off-farm job. So, 
I left Fussy Gourmet Farm and took a job at the Sandhills AgInnovation Center to save money 
and focus on reducing my student debt. I even delayed marrying my wife until after purchasing 
my farmland because her $70,000 in student loan debt would have further exacerbated my high 
debt to income ratio. The barriers to farming became not just financial but personal.  
 
In 2019, I was able to purchase 42 acres of land in Laurinburg, North Carolina. Land is 
fundamental, but land is just the beginning. Farming is a capital-intensive undertaking - you need 
land as well as tractors and equipment, plants and inputs. Having an off-farm job has been 
essential to capitalizing the farm, but it also keeps me away from the farm for 40-60 hours a 
week. Farming only in the evenings and weekends holds my farm business back from its full 
potential and takes a toll on my mental and physical health.  
 
Access to Markets  
I’m in one of the poorest counties in North Carolina, but that’s the only place I was able to 
purchase land. Because of this, I’m several hours from the more lucrative markets of Charlotte 
and Raleigh. But I got into farming to serve my local community: to build community resilience, 
provide economic development and employ local people, and give our community access to 
healthy foods they’ve never had access to before. Local food builds local resiliency. The 
COVID-19 pandemic proved that to us. When our national food distribution networks failed us, 
the local farmer could guarantee access to food for their community. 
2 
 
That’s why I’m interested in growing our market opportunity here in Southeastern North 
Carolina and using value-added products to help our juice reach schools and community centers. 
But this local food infrastructure needs government investment.  
 
Programs like the Local Agriculture Market Program (LAMP) support local and regional 
markets that are critical infrastructure to young farmers like me. Providing grants to producers 
and state and local organizations via the Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program 
(FMLFPP) is building stronger local and regional markets. I hope this program improves to 
ensure more accessible participation for small and beginning producers, as well as small 
processors and distribution centers like Sandhill AgInnovation Center. I ask you to increase 
funding for FMLFPP and VAPG. 
 
Value-Added Production has been critical to the success of my farm. Grapes last for six 
weeks after harvest but the juice lasts for two years. We wait nine months to get a profit from 
this crop, so by making a value-added product of juice, we are able to make the income last 
longer.  The value-add has allowed us to engage with more buyers. A production facility on-farm 
would increase productivity and revenue diversification, and the Value-Added Producer Grant 
(VAPG) could make that dream a reality. But unfortunately, there are barriers for a young farmer 
to access the program. There is a match requirement that is out of reach for me, and often the 
application is open during the growing season when I don’t have the time to complete the 
significant application. The paperwork is just too big of a barrier for a small operation like mine. 
I ask that you consider additional funding for this program, paired with requirements for USDA 
to review how they’re ensuring this program is accessible to new and beginning farmers.  
 
Diversification as Risk Management  
Farming is a risky undertaking. When I tell the banks about my farm and desire to provide for 
my local community, they ask me if I’m willing to take a gamble on that. We must decrease risk 
for new entrants to agriculture. You shouldn’t have to bet your life for the farm.  
 
The most important risk management tool on my farm is crop diversification. We have to 
diversify so we can spread our risk out over the entire farm. I should point out that one of the 
reasons for that is that in North Carolina, Muscadine grapes are not insurable with the Risk 
Management Agency in my county and the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program 
(NAP) does offer lower premiums for me because I’m a beginning farmer, a qualifying veteran, 
and a Black farmer, but it’s another bill that I can’t afford. Whole Farm Revenue Insurance is 
better designed for more established farmers.  
 
The reality is that with climate change intensifying, diversification of crops/products will 
save the family farm. My farm is about an hour and a half from the ocean. When hurricanes 
3 
come, they wreak havoc on the farm. Our grapes ripen during hurricane season. If we have 
nothing but grapes out there and a hurricane comes through, we’re in serious trouble. Crop 
diversification is a way to make farming less risky. More diversification lets me sleep better at 
night.  
 
Investing in Young Farmers and Farmers of Color  
If we can’t make agriculture more viable for young people, then we cannot guarantee the future 
of agriculture in this country. If we need 100,000 farmers over the next 10 years to replace our 
aging farmer population, we’ll need to address the barriers that young farmers face. Young 
people and people of color want to farm, we must invest in their operations and ensure they can 
access programs designed to help them.  
 
When you’re allocating money, please invest in the Farming Opportunities Training and 
Outreach (FOTO). The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program (BFRDP), 
provides competitive grants to nonprofits and universities for beginning farmer training 
opportunities. Current funding allows only 25% of applicant projects to be funded, and I know 
from my work at the National Young Farmers Coalition that many more projects are not 
submitted because of the matching requirements and onerous application. 
 
The Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged and Veteran Farmers and Ranchers 
Grant Program (also known as the “2501 Program”) that provides federal grants to organizations 
that work with farmers of color and veterans like me must also be funded to the maximum 
permissible levels. This program is particularly important as we consider the history of 
discrimination at USDA and the current reality that 95% of farmers are white.  
 
Other USDA programs, like Rural Development grants and funding for the USDA Rural 
Development, need further investment.  Our rural communities are slipping away, and we need 
further investment to prevent school closings and consolidation because of population decrease. 
Invest in young farmers like myself so that we are able to return to these rural communities, 
especially in the South that has been left behind since the Civil War and where hundreds of 
Black farmers have lost their land and livelihoods. If we don’t invest in thriving rural 
communities and make farming viable business, Black farmers will continue to decline.  That is 
why we also need funding and administration action on enacting the 2018 Farm Bill Relending 
Program to Resolve Ownership and Succession in Farmland. This fund would help cover legal 
costs and succession plans to secure land ownership by farmers of color. To stem the tide of land 
falling out of the ownership of farmers of color, and to resolve heirs property challenges, I ask 
you to fund this program generously and to hold USDA accountable to implement it.  
 
Access to Credit and USDA  
4 
When I started farming, I asked other farmers how they could afford to do this work. I was told 
not to use USDA programs at all, that I could get myself into trouble working with USDA. But 
USDA loans are low-interest and are meant for farmers who can’t get credit with traditional 
banks. When I first went to FSA and said I wanted to farm, the loan officer said, “We will never 
fund perennials, that’s not going to happen.” There was a lack of understanding about non-
traditional operations. They were used to financing hog and chicken farmers. We need to 
improve the cultural competency of USDA staff so that they are prepared to talk with Black 
farmers, young farmers, and those starting diversified and non-traditional businesses.  
 
For years, I tried to use alternatives to USDA loans. I’ve used Kiva loans and GoFundMe, but 
there is a limit to crowdfunding. The company Steward approached me to offer me financing but 
at a 7 or 8% interest rate. The USDA Microloan, offering up to $50,000 at between 1-2% interest 
rate is perfect for me as a young farmer, but the application is too intimidating. The National 
Young Farmers Coalition found in a 2017 survey that 40% of farm owners found USDA 
applications too burdensome.1 I would like to see USDA modernize its services and put the 
application process online. Quicker turnarounds are also needed.  
 
As I mentioned earlier, student loan debt is a huge barrier for young farmers accessing credit to 
build their farm businesses. Our monthly student loan payment is $1,000. That could be an 
equipment payment or another land payment. My wife is a nurse, and we’re committed to the 
health of our community. We’re not looking for a handout, but an acknowledgement of this 
commitment to our community and to our public service. Another aspiring farmer in my 
community said he could never farm because of his student loan debt. If young people are 
saddled with student loans, how will we replace our aging farm population?  
 
Cooperative Extension and Technical Assistance  
Another primary support to my farm business is having technical assistance from my local 
Cooperative Extension. I talk to Extension on a daily basis. Funding for Cooperative Extension 
has stayed relatively flat over the last ten years, and should match the investment made to the 
Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) that provides competitive research, education, 
and extension grants. This on-the-ground assistance is a lifeline for my farm and countless 
others.  
 
Conclusion 
As I look back at my journey in agriculture, it has been one of struggle and perseverance. When I 
drive through my rural community all I see is farms disappearing left and right, and I often ask 
myself where this country will be if we lose our small farmers. There is no shortage of young

farmers committed to guiding agriculture into the future, but we must invest in their success. The 
work that I do is not just farming but advocating for other small and beginning farmers like me. I 
thank you for listening and hosting this important hearing. I appreciate the opportunity to 
highlight my farming experiences and the challenges affecting young farmers of color like me.

COVID-19 in Indian Country 
 
April 28, 2021 
 
Elizabeth Fowler 
Acting Director, Indian Health Service 
 
 
Good morning Chairman Merkley, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and Members of the Committee.  
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the Indian Health Service’s (IHS) continued efforts to 
respond to and mitigate the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic in American Indian and Alaska 
Native communities. 
 
Responding to and Mitigating the Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic  
 
Over the past year, the IHS has worked closely with our Tribal and Urban Indian Organization 
(UIO) partners, state and local public health officials, and our fellow Federal agencies to 
coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the pandemic. Our number one priority has 
been the safety of our IHS patients and staff, as well as Tribal community members.  
 
The IHS continues to play a central role as part of an all-of-nation approach to prevent, detect, 
treat, and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are partnering with other Federal agencies, 
states, Tribes, Tribal organizations, UIOs, universities, and others to achieve that mission. We 
protect our workforce through education, training, and distribution of clinical guidance and 
personal protective equipment (PPE). We also protect our Tribal communities through 
supporting Tribal leaders in making their decisions about community mitigation strategies that 
are responsive to local conditions, and to protect the health and safety of Tribal citizens as those 
communities make plans to safely open and resume regular operations.  
 
While the Indian health system is large and complex, we realize that preventing, detecting, 
treating, and recovering from COVID-19 requires local expertise. We continue to participate in 
regular conference calls with Tribal and UIO leaders from across the country to provide updates, 
answer questions, and hear their concerns. In addition, IHS engages in rapid Tribal Consultation 
and Urban Confer sessions in advance of distributing COVID-19 resources to ensure that funds 
meet the needs of Indian Country. 
 
I am grateful to Congress for supporting our efforts through the passage of the Coronavirus 
Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020; the Families First Coronavirus 
Response Act; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act; the Paycheck 
Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act; the Coronavirus Response and Relief 
Supplemental Appropriations Act; and now the American Rescue Plan Act. These laws have 
provided additional resources, authorities, and flexibilities that have helped IHS, Tribal, and urban 
Indian health programs to continue providing critical services throughout the pandemic.  Together, 
these Acts have permitted the IHS to administer over $9 billion to IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian 
1 
 
health programs to prepare for and respond to Coronavirus. These resources have helped us expand 
vaccinations, testing, public health surveillance, and health care services. Moreover, they support the 
distribution of critical medical supplies and PPE in response to the pandemic. The American Rescue 
Plan Act in particular makes a historic investment in Indian Country. The Act provides 
approximately $6.1 billion in new funding to support IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs 
to combat COVID-19, expand services, and recover critical revenues. 
 
With the passage of each supplemental appropriation, the IHS conducted Tribal Consultation tribal 
consultation and Urban Confer to rapidly seek input from Tribal and Urban Indian Organization 
leaders.  Their priorities and needs are the foundation for our allocation decisions.  We have 
incorporated their requests for maximum flexibility to allow Tribal communities and Urban Indian 
Organizations to respond to the unique needs of the patients they serve, rapid funding distribution so 
that urgently needed resources available as soon as possible, and the use of existing funding 
methodologies and mechanisms into all of our decision-making.   
 
The IHS communicated all funding decisions through Dear Tribal and Urban Indian Organization 
Leader Letters, which are available on the IHS website.  A comprehensive overview of all funding 
allocations to date is available at 
https://www.ihs.gov/sites/coronavirus/themes/responsive2017/display_objects/documents/FY-2020-
2021-COVID19-ARPA-Funding-Summary.pdf.  
 
It has been over a year now that IHS and our dedicated workforce has been responding to the 
COVID-19 Pandemic. Over the last year, the IHS has marked considerable achievements. The IHS 
COVID-19 Incident Command Structure was created to establish communication protocols to ensure 
comprehensive situational awareness and efficient deployment of resources. We instituted reporting 
mechanisms to create a central information repository for the IHS COVID-19 response.  
 
We developed a COVID-19 data surveillance system and the IHS COVID-19 website to share 
critical health information, important COVID-19 vaccine information and updates, and we 
disseminate clinical guidance, training, and webinars. We provide assistance to the IHS and Tribal 
facilities through Critical Care Response Teams and Tele Infection Control Assessment and 
Response assessments.  
 
We are detecting COVID-19 through screening and state-of-the-art lab testing. We have distributed a 
total of 830 Abbott ID NOW rapid point-of-care analyzers, as well as 1.9 million rapid COVID-19 
tests. The IHS National Supply Service Center (NSSC) has also distributed over 84 million units of 
PPE and other Coronavirus response-related products to IHS, Tribal, and UIO (I/T/U) health care 
facilities at no cost, including 2.6 million testing swabs and transport media. As of April 19, 2021, 
we have performed 2,278,275 tests in our American Indian and Alaska Native communities. Of those 
tests, 193,069 (8.5 percent, cumulative data) have been positive.  
 
The IHS increased coordination with Federal partners to streamline access for I/T/U supply requests 
to the Strategic National Stockpile. A PPE request tracking system was developed and IHS staff were 
placed in liaison functions to ensure oversight on I/T/U requests. The IHS burn rate calculator for 
tracking PPE has been implemented to improve the data quality. A guide on ordering/requests 
process for Emergency Management Points of Contact has been posted online for ongoing strategic 
purposes. NSSC has supplied testing kits in response to all Area requests, a new contract with Abbott 
ID has started and they are shipping directly to I/T/U sites.

The IHS has a sufficient supply of therapeutic agents currently authorized or approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir and the 
combination monoclonal antibody products, and is distributing them to I/T/U health care facilities 
upon request. The IHS National Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee provides clinical guidance to 
Areas and facilities regarding new treatments for COVID-19 and, through its Pharmacovigilance 
program, also monitors medication safety in our service population. 
 
During the pandemic, the IHS faced life-threatening medical surges that required additional acute 
care and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds. The IHS and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), 
Veterans Health Administration, signed an Interagency Agreement that set forth terms and conditions 
governing the arrangement for the standardized coordination and delivery of health care and other 
services between VA and IHS during disasters, public health incidents, and other emergencies. 
 
We are treating each and every patient with culturally competent, patient-centered, relationship-based 
care. As we look to recover from COVID-19, the IHS is supporting the emotional well-being and 
mental health of its workforce and the communities we serve, by providing training, education, and 
access to treatment that draws from the faith and traditions of American Indians and Alaska Natives, 
as well as their long history of cultural resilience.  
 
In April 2020, IHS expanded the use of an Agency-wide video conferencing platform that allows for 
telehealth on almost any internet-connected device and in any setting, including patients' homes. 
Around the same time IHS also permitted the emergency use of certain commonly available mobile 
apps to enable the provision of services remotely while minimizing exposure risk to both patients and 
staff. These actions, along with the actions taken by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
to allow payment for previously non-billable services, made it possible for IHS to dramatically 
increase our use of telehealth from an average of under 1,300 visits per month in early 2020 to a peak 
of over 40,000 per month in June and July of that year. More recent data suggests a plateau of around 
30,000 monthly telehealth visits. It is important to note that on average, about 80 percent of 
telehealth encounters across IHS are conducted using audio only, largely related to the limited 
availability of technologies and bandwidth capacity in the communities we serve across the country. 
IHS is currently in the process of procuring an additional cloud-based telehealth platform to 
complement our existing solutions and distribute telehealth funds to sites for equipment and devices 
to improve access for more interactive telehealth encounters. 
 
EHR and Facilities Modernization  
 
As the IHS expands its use of technology to provide telehealth services, the pandemic also 
highlighted the challenges and risks posed by the decentralized and distributed health information 
technology architecture currently in use by the Agency. While our facilities use a capable, nationally-
certified electronic health record (EHR) system, the fact that it is internally developed by IHS and is 
installed separately at hundreds of locations nationwide created significant barriers to the rapid 
response needed for COVID-19. We are extremely proud of how our informatics and technology 
staff made changes to the system to support COVID-19 testing, diagnosis, and vaccination 
documentation and reporting, and how the field was able to implement these changes into clinical 
workflows. However, we know that those activities would have been much more streamlined in an 
updated technology environment. 
  
This experience has validated and reinforced IHS’ commitment to the modernization of our EHR 
system and health information technology infrastructure. The funding for EHR modernization 
3 
 
provided by Congress in the CARES Act, the FY2021 appropriation, and the American Rescue Plan 
Act will allow us to proceed with the foundational steps in this important multi-year effort. In 
accordance with the language of the FY2021 appropriation, IHS plans to inform the appropriate 
Congressional committees in the near future of the outline for our planned approach to EHR 
modernization.  
 
The IHS experience with its EHR system underscores issues related to infrastructure modernization, 
more generally. Aging medical facilities can impede medical innovation. Modern hospitals have 
complex equipment with high electrical requirements. Contemporary hospitals are designed to 
provide clean, reliable power to ensure that patient care is uninterrupted.   The difficulty in 
retrofitting older hospitals with modern technology includes  the lack of equipment space, inadequate 
power, and lack of cooling capacity, all of which represent a significant challenge to technology 
infrastructure upgrades. 
 
In addition, the pandemic highlighted challenges that some older facilities pose to delivering health 
care services. It is the IHS’ policy to use the physical environment to help prevent and control the 
spread of infection. This past year has shown that some facilities’ patient flow often did not allow for 
social separation and that waiting areas are not sized or structured for social distancing. Optimally, 
infected and non-infected patients would be separated, and patients would flow in one direction 
through the facility. This is not possible in some IHS facilities, which resulted in limiting 
appointments, renovation of space, or providing temporary space outside of the facility to separate 
patients. 
 
Vaccinations – Allocations and Administration  
 
IHS developed a vaccine strategy led by the IHS Incident Command Structure and the designated 
IHS Vaccine Task Force. This effort was informed by the Federal Vaccine Response Operation 
(FVRO) and aligned with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FVRO, and Tribal 
stakeholder input. HHS and IHS participated in Tribal Consultation and Urban Indian Confer in 
development of the plan, and a final IHS Vaccine Plan was published on November 18, 2020.  
 
Working with Tribal communities, I/T/U health programs receiving vaccines for distribution through 
the IHS have administered 1,164,179 doses as of April 19, 2021. This achievement is despite the 
challenges IHS faces in terms of the predominantly rural and remote locations we serve and the 
infrastructure challenges those communities face. The IHS reached its goal to administer  
1 million COVID-19 vaccines by the end of March (administering 1,007,002 doses as of March 31, 
2021) after surpassing its goal of administering 400,000 vaccines by the end of February 2021.  The 
IHS now aims to have 44 percent of its adult patients fully vaccinated by the end of April 2021.  As 
of April 19 2021, 37.9 percent of IHS adult patient population are fully vaccinated. 
 
In February and March, 260,000 supplemental vaccine doses were sent to Indian Country. IHS 
remains committed to vaccine availability for all individuals within our health care system. This 
Federal vaccination effort is possible because of strong partnerships with Tribal and Urban Indian 
health facilities, and the resources provided by Congress.  At IHS, we know that Tribal Nations are in 
the best position to determine the needs of their citizens.  
 
Information on the number of COVID-19 vaccines administered across the IHS can be found at 
https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations, displayed in the Federal Entities section 
under the map. The IHS is working diligently with our CDC partners to report and validate vaccine 
4 
 
administration data as quickly as possible. IHS estimates the current number of people vaccinated 
may be higher than reflected in the validated data on the CDC COVID Tracker. Communicating 
accurate and timely information remains a priority for the IHS.  
 
Since mid-December 2020, the IHS has distributed 1,661,085 vaccine doses of the FDA-authorized 
Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID-19 vaccines. IHS has shipped 
vaccines directly to 295 I/T/U facilities and used a hub and spoke model to ensure all 352 facilities 
that are coordinating vaccines through the IHS receive vaccines. The table below shows the total 
number of vaccine doses distributed and administered per IHS Area as of April 19, 2021.  Based on 
guidance from the FDA and CDC, the IHS paused administration of the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen 
vaccine from April 13 -24, 2021.  The IHS resumed administering the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen 
vaccine now that the FDA and CDC has issued guidance lifting the temporary pause.

Access to Clean Water 
 
Supporting Tribes to ensure they are able to supply safe water to their communities during the 
COVID- 19 outbreak is an important aspect of the IHS COVID-19 response. Access to water is 
critical for hand washing and cleaning environmental surfaces to help break the virus’ chain of 
infection and reduce the pressure on the IHS health care delivery system, which is a critical concern.  
 
To address this concern, the IHS over the past year deployed nine teams of 40 U.S. Public Health 
Service Commissioned Corps Officers in support of the Navajo Nation to improve access to safe 
water points. This work included surveying the availability of safe water points across 110 Chapters 
over 27,000 square miles. The survey identified 59 locations where additional water points were 
needed. Following the survey, the teams completed water points site installation designs, 
construction/beneficial use inspections, and operation and maintenance trainings at these locations. 
The installation of these water points resulted in a reduction in round trip travel distance from 52 
miles to 17 miles and was completed within 6 months.  
 
In addition to increasing the number of water points, the mission helped ensure a means to safely 
transport water for in-home drinking and cooking. This was achieved by providing 107 Navajo 
Chapters over 37,000 water storage containers to be distributed to each resident living in a home with 
no piped water. Water disinfection tablets, to boost water disinfection levels in the water storage 
containers, were also provided to Chapters as needed based on the field team measured water point 
disinfection levels. These innovative actions will help to improve the stored water quality and reduce 
the risk of gastrointestinal illness among water point users.  
 
The teams also worked to increase public awareness of water service availability and developed 
creative public health outreach materials describing the importance of the water service use through a 
multimedia campaign (online, print newspaper, and radio) broadcast across the Navajo Nation. This 
6 
 
included assisting the Navajo Nation in developing a website, which includes an interactive map of 
the water points, to communicate the location, hours of operation, and Chapter contact information. 
Officers developed outreach materials highlighting the importance of accessing water at regulated 
water points and promotion of safe water storage practices.  
 
FY 2022 President’s Budget 
 
On March 31, 2021, the White House released the President’s FY 2022 Discretionary Request, which 
includes $8.5 billion in discretionary budget authority for the IHS.  This funding level is a historic 
increase of $2.2 billion or 36 percent over FY 2021.  These funds will increase access to high-quality 
health care in Indian Country, and begin to remediate the impacts of chronic underfunding of the 
IHS. 
 
The Discretionary Request also proposes advance appropriations for the IHS to insulate the I/T/U 
health programs from the impact of government shutdowns, and the uncertainty of annual 
appropriations.   
 
I look forward to participating in the robust Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer to evaluate 
options, including mandatory funding, to provide adequate, stable, and predictable funding for IHS in 
the future.  This Tribal consultation process is an important step in honoring our government’s 
responsibility to American Indian and Alaska Native people. 
 
These proposals align with feedback from Tribal and UIO leaders.  The FY 2022 Tribal Budget 
Recommendation included a proposal for advance appropriation and a dramatic funding increase for 
the IHS. 
 
We look forward to continuing our work with Tribal and Federal partners. As we work towards 
recovery, we are committed to working closely with our stakeholders and understand the importance 
of working with partners during this difficult time. We strongly encourage everyone to continue to 
follow CDC guidelines and instructions from their local, state, and Tribal governments to prevent the 
spread of COVID-19 and protect the health and safety of our communities. Thank you again for the 
opportunity to speak with you today.

Testimony of 
Yogananda D. Pittman, Acting Chief of Police 
United States Capitol Police 
 
For the U.S. Senate 
Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, Committee on Appropriations  
 
April 21, 2021 
 
 
Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Braun, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the 
opportunity to present the United States Capitol Police (USCP) budget request for Fiscal Year 
2022.  The Department greatly appreciates the Subcommittee’s continued support of the women 
and men of the Department as well as Congress’ generosity in providing the resources needed to 
support our crucial mission to protect the Congress and the U.S. Capitol.  
 
Joining me today is the Department’s Executive Team – Assistant Chief Chad Thomas, Acting 
Assistant Chief Sean Gallagher, Chief Administrative Officer Richard Braddock, and General 
Counsel Thomas DiBiase – as well as members of the USCP Executive Management Team.   
 
Throughout its history, the USCP has held a unique role in policing.  We are the only law 
enforcement agency responsible for protecting the Congress in DC and abroad and the U.S. 
Capitol Complex. We detect, investigate, and prevent threats made against Members of Congress 
and the U.S. Capitol. We provide a steady, watchful presence throughout the Capitol Complex, 
and we are responsible for protecting elected officials to ensure the continuity of government.  
 
The type of policing that we engage in is highly specialized to focus on the unique requirements 
of protecting our nation’s legislative process as well as ensure that citizens may participate in 
lawful First Amendment activities on the Capitol Grounds. All the while, the Department is 
expected to maintain the security of an open campus so that visitors may witness representative 
democracy in action.   
 
 
The USCP is a full-service agency. We conduct investigations with our law enforcement partners 
both in Washington, D.C. and across the country, to include working with the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Park Police, Metropolitan Police Department, Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and many others.  
 
The Department’s personnel are resilient, highly trained in specialized fields, and deeply 
committed to our critical mission to protect and secure the U.S. Capitol and the Congress.  Under 
my leadership, I intend to focus on four key elements to further strengthen and support the USCP 
workforce: Senator and Member protection; health and wellness programs; training; and 
obtaining the equipment and facilities to meet the needs of the workforce of the future.  
 
In the Department’s efforts to address new and emerging threats, we work closely with the 
Senate and House Sergeants at Arms to augment and strengthen off-campus security and Senator 
and Member protection.  We routinely collaborate to assess Senators’ state office and Members’ 
district office security, and we provide recommendations on ways to improve and enhance 
security measures and practices inside and outside of the National Capital Region (NCR).  We 
also work closely with the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) to address the physical security of the 
Capitol Complex, in addition to facility and support needs for the USCP workforce.  
 
In the first four months of 2021, there has been a 64.62 percent increase in threats to Members 
compared to the same period in 2020. And from 2017 to 2020, there has been a 118.66 percent 
increase in total threats and directions of interests, with the overwhelming majority of suspects 
residing outside of the NCR.  
 
Therefore, a significant focus of the Department in FY 2022 is centered on Member security 
outside of the NCR. The direct impact to the Department not only includes our current protective 
services’ increased posture around the country, but includes increasing the resources available 
for our Protective and Intelligence Operations through the expansion of the USCP’s protective, 
intelligence and investigatory capabilities both on the Capitol Complex and throughout the 
United States. While we have complemented our increased posture with the leveraging of 
federal, state and local law enforcement partnerships with the collective goal of protecting the 
2 
 
 
Congress away from the Capitol Grounds, the number of agents required to provide an 
appropriate level of analysis, protection and enforcement necessitates a significant increase in 
personnel based on the threats trends year-over-year.  
 
On the Capitol Complex, the level of existential threats to the U.S. Capitol and Grounds are 
increasing as well. Most recently, on April 2, 2021 a lone assailant struck two officers with a 
vehicle at the North Barricade, resulting in one line-of-duty death and one critical injury. Further, 
on January 6, 2021 insurrectionists attempted to prevent the Congress from certifying the 2020 
Electoral College results by storming the U.S. Capitol.  Due to the heroic actions of USCP 
officers, with the assistance of the Metropolitan Police Department, the National Guard, and 
many other of our law enforcement partners, the violent rioters were prevented from 
accomplishing their goal.   
 
The USCP is steadfast in ensuring that an incident of this nature will never occur again, 
especially with the realization that the possibility of a similar incident occurring in the current 
environment is a very real and present danger. The events of January 6, 2021, demonstrate that 
the USCP must continue to quickly assess, adjust, and utilize the tactics and methods necessary 
to successfully carry out our mission in any scenario.  This will require a significant investment 
in the necessary training, tools, and information gathering resources needed to meet the dynamic 
and ever-changing security challenges, including the rising threat of domestic terrorism. Most 
importantly, it will require the Department having a dedicated standby ready force of two 
platoons (80 officers) at all times, thereby removing the Department’s full reliance on partner 
agencies for mission support when faced with an immediate threat event.     
 
In the wake of the insurrection attempt and immediately following the April 2nd event, the 
Department invested additional resources, with the generous support of the Congress, to ensure 
that our officers have the support services they need as they continue to process what occurred.  
This has included 24/7 access to onsite trauma informed professional counselors through the 
collaborative partnership with the House Office of Employee Assistance (OEA), the enhanced 
services of OEA, peer counseling sessions with law enforcement officers from neighboring law 
enforcement agencies, and counseling services for officers’ family members.  The Department 
3 
 
 
also provided over 19,600 nights in hotel room stays for its personnel, served over 89,000 daily 
hot meals and 172,900 cups of hot beverages, and reopened the USCP gyms 24/7 taking into 
account all safety protocols to ensure COVID-19 transmission is neutralized.   
 
I am committed to ensuring the health and wellbeing of our workforce, both mentally and 
physically, and it is my intent to ensure the Department will continue to identify new resources 
that may be of assistance to both our sworn and civilian employees so that they may be at their 
very best. To this end, on February 4, 2021, I was pleased to announce to our workforce that, 
thanks to the efforts of Congressional leaders and the Administration, enough doses of the 
COVID-19 vaccines were secured to vaccinate all USCP personnel who want to be vaccinated.  
Working closely with the Office of Attending Physician, they were able to begin administering 
the doses to our employees quickly and safely.  To date, over 67 percent of the Department has 
received vaccines.  By the beginning of May 2021, all USCP employees wanting the COVID 
vaccine are expected to have received their second dose of the vaccine.   
 
The USCP’s employees are our greatest assets.  Accordingly, the Department’s FY 2022 budget 
request is an investment in our employees, and focuses on meeting mandatory salary 
requirements, overtime for critical training, and securing additional capabilities within the 
USCP’s General Expenses to increase the resources available to our personnel.   
 
The FY 2022 USCP budget request includes the budgetary authority and resources to fund 2,112 
sworn and 453 civilians.  This includes funding for 212 new sworn officers for mission critical 
requirements, such as a standby quick response force, threat assessment agents, and dignitary 
protection agents.  
 
The request for the Salaries appropriation is $481.75 Million which is an increase of $57.35 
Million over the FY 2021 enacted levels. The main drivers of the cost increases are increases in 
FY 2020 and FY 2021 benefit rates (FERS, FEHB) not reflected in the FY 2021 enacted levels, 
as well as overtime for core mission, cost-of-living adjustments, and within grade increases.  The 
USCP is also requesting $2.5 Million for its student loan repayment program, as this program is 
4 
 
 
a critical component of employee retention and an additional incentive for recruiting the 
additional personnel needed to carry out the Department’s evolving mission.  
 
Countering evolving domestic and international threats requires constantly sharing intelligence 
information throughout the entire Department from analysts to officials to the officers on post, as 
well as gathering intelligence and working with partner law enforcement agencies. In response to 
one of the lessons learned on January 6th, the Department revised its internal communications 
policies and processes, and has included emerging technologies and tools in this budget request 
to assist with effecting the ideal communications state for the Department to meet its mission. 
Further, the events of that day highlighted critical areas that require new or modified training 
throughout the Operational elements of the Department in order to maintain the highest levels of 
readiness. It is my intent to begin such trainings and exercises as soon as practicable, and our FY 
2022 budget request highlights all such training as a priority.  
 
Additionally, as a result of January 6th, the Operational elements of the Department have 
identified the need for new officer safety equipment based on the evolving threats and physical 
security requirements for the Capitol Complex. In the weeks and months ahead, I will be 
working with the AOC to jointly produce recommendations for the physical hardening of the 
Capitol Complex as well as identify USCP facility needs to ensure appropriate space is obtained 
by the AOC for the growing USCP workforce as well as the storage space for the new equipment 
needed to appropriately execute our mission.  
 
As a result of the aforementioned priorities, the FY 2022 General Expenses portion of this 
budget request was developed with an emphasis on providing specialized training for our 
employees as well as investing in the tools and technologies we need to maintain the highest 
level of readiness.  This includes items such as protective travel; mandatory training; hiring, 
outfitting, and training new sworn personnel; upgrading and maintaining security equipment; 
updating and maintaining the motor vehicle fleet; providing uniforms, weapons, and ammunition 
for all sworn personnel; access to the employee assistance program; and other non-personnel 
needs.   
 
5 
 
 
The General Expenses request is $137.47 Million, which is an increase of $49.96 Million. For 
Salaries and General Expenses together, the total budget request for the FY 2022 annual budget 
appropriation is $619.22 Million, which is an increase of 20.96% over FY 2021 enacted levels.    
 
I want to again reiterate that our officers who are on the job 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, are 
our greatest assets in helping to prevent and respond to threats. To ensure that the USCP is 
always at the ready to keep the Capitol Complex safe and secure, it is important that we make 
these crucial investments at this time. While our FY 2022 budget request was reformulated in the 
aftermath of the January 6th events, it was developed as a result of a deep analysis within the 
Operational elements of the Department for what is necessary to meet the mission. I believe that 
all of the new operational requirements, and necessary support components to support 
Operations, requested in this budget will do just that – allow us to continue to meet our mission 
now and into the future.    
 
Prior to January 6th, the Department had prepared an FY 2022 budget justification that 
represented a $36M increase over the FY 2021 enacted level.  The events of January 6th caused 
the Department to reevaluate its budget justification, specifically around the emergency needs to 
meet the emerging threats and risk.  The revised FY 2022 budget justification representing a 
$107M increase includes many of these emergency needs that are reoccurring.  While long-term 
funding for these needs will be necessary in our base funding going forward, the Department 
could certainly benefit if the funds could be provided sooner through other means. 
 
And lastly, the USCP has a professional working relationship with the Capitol Police Board, its 
oversight Committees, the USCP Inspector General and the USCP labor unions to review options 
for efficiencies where possible. It is my intention to not only continue engagement, but to 
improve these relationships so that together the Department becomes holistically stronger. In the 
coming months, it is anticipated that there will likely be a significant number of formal 
recommendations that result in the need for substantial additional human and budgetary 
resources based on the January 6, 2021 review by the USCP Inspector General, third-party 
assessments being conducted, and other potential Congressional reviews.  The Department is 
committed to working with the Subcommittee to seek any such resources to address these 
6 
 
 
potential recommendations via future budget requests, amendments to the current budget 
justification, or other vehicles as appropriate.  
 
We realize that these requests for funding, as well as those resulting from the other reviews and 
recommendations, will present challenges to the Congress as it considers the appropriate funding 
levels for the Legislative Branch.  The Department is prepared to work closely with the 
Subcommittee to provide a clear understanding of the Department’s requirements and to 
prioritize these items as necessary.   
 
Mr. Chairman, thank you again for the opportunity to discuss the United States Capitol Police’s 
FY 2022 budget request and our priorities for this coming year.  We will continue to work 
closely with you and the Subcommittee to ensure that we meet the needs of our officers and the 
Department as well as the expectations of this Committee and the Congress.  
 
I would be pleased to answer any questions that you may have at this time.

Senate Appropriations Committee Hearing 
“The American Jobs Plan: Infrastructure, Climate Change, and Investing in our 
Nation’s Future” 
April 20, 2021 
Testimony of U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg 
  
Chairman Leahy, Vice Chairman Shelby, and Members of the Committee, thank 
you for the opportunity to testify today.  
We are gathering at a moment in which our infrastructure situation calls both for 
urgent action and a long-term, strategic vision. As we speak, a climate crisis is already 
hurting Americans, and it will continue to get far worse if we don’t act. And in this 
moment, we need to add back millions of jobs to fully recover from the pandemic, even 
as we build a stronger foundation for the economic future.   
It is in this context that we see the American Jobs Plan as a once-in-a-generation 
opportunity to meet this consequential moment and win the future for the country we all 
serve.     
The plan will improve more than 20,000 miles of roads and 10,000 bridges. It will 
strengthen aviation, ports, and waterways. It will address critical backlogs in rail and 
expand world-class passenger rail services, including high-speed rail. It has dedicated 
funds for projects that will have significant benefits to the regional or national economy 
but are too large or complex for existing funding programs.   
The American Jobs Plan will fix and modernize our transportation system so that 
our economy—and our country—can thrive. That means finally addressing the inequities 
of our past transportation, and by increasing access and equity in projects going forward. 
And that means tackling the climate crisis.   
In the United States, the transportation sector is the economy's single biggest 
contributor to greenhouse gases - which means it can and must be a big part of the 
solution to climate change. The American Jobs Plan will move us away from our over-
reliance on fossil fuels and towards net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It will spark an 
electric vehicle revolution, building a network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers across 
the country—in urban and rural areas—and providing rebates to make electric vehicles 
affordable for more Americans.   
The plan will double federal funding for public transit, making it a more reliable 
and accessible option to more people. And by investing billions to make travel safer for 
all Americans, whether they move by car, public transit, foot, bike, wheelchair, or any 
other means, it will reduce congestion on the road and pollution in the air.   
We draw inspiration from the New Deal’s infrastructure projects and President 
Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System, but we cannot afford to rely on the original 
version of the roads, bridges, and airports they built all those years ago. The need for new 
investment is impossible to ignore. We see it in the sections of California’s Highway 1 
that fell into the ocean; in the Gulf Coast flooding that halted rail service after Hurricane 
Harvey; and in the loss of subway service for millions of New Yorkers after Hurricane 
Sandy. We see it in the storms on our coasts, the floods in the Midwest, the wildfires in 
California and the deadly snowstorm in Texas. We must adapt.  Our proposed resilience 
investments would support projects across America that reinforce, upgrade or realign 
existing transportation infrastructure to better withstand extreme weather events and other 
effects of climate change.  
I have heard it said that the American Jobs Plan should be about roads and 
bridges but should not address climate change. I would compare that to drawing up plans 
for a new restaurant with no consideration for health, safety, or cleanliness. The truth is 
that every infrastructure decision is already, inevitably a climate decision as well. Our 
choices on roads, bridges, and other infrastructure must recognize and reduce the very 
real threat that climate change poses to American lives and livelihoods.  
This is also our opportunity to deliver equity where it has been denied in the past, 
which is why at least 40% of the benefits of the plan’s climate investments will flow to 
overburdened and underserved communities, who often bear a disproportionate burden 
of transportation pollution.  
And yes, this is fundamentally an investment in our economy. The time has come 
to break the old, false framework of ""climate versus jobs."" 
After all, American workers are going to do the work rebuilding roads, laying new 
cables and pipes, retrofitting buildings, installing electric vehicle chargers, and 
manufacturing the vehicles that will use those electric chargers.   
In fact, this is the biggest American jobs investment since World War II. It will 
support millions of new, prevailing wage jobs, the majority of which will be available to 
people without a college degree.  
The American Jobs Plan is a chance to empower America's workers, secure our 
climate, and restore America's leadership position in an increasingly competitive 
world. It’s our chance to build a future where transportation inspires dreams and not 
dread, a source of opportunity rather than a constraint on the budgets and livelihoods of 
American workers and families.  
American livelihoods rise or fall based on infrastructure choices that reverberate 
for decades. This plan is how the generations now in charge can make good on our 
responsibility to keep the American dream alive for the generation now coming of age 
and those to follow.  
I look forward to working with members of the Committee to make that 
possible. Thank you again for the opportunity to appear today. I will be happy to answer 
your questions. "

Prepared Statement  
Of 
Dr. Terry Adirim, MD, MPH, MBA 
Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) 
 
REGARDING   
THE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM  
 
BEFORE THE 
  
SENATEAPPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE  
DEFENSE SUBCOMMITTEE  
 
April 20, 2021 
 
Not for publication until released by the Committee 
 
 
 
  1
Chairman Tester, Vice Chairman Shelby, distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, I 
am pleased to represent the Office of the Secretary of Defense to discuss the Defense Health 
Program (DHP) and its contributions to the health affairs of the Department.  I am honored to 
represent the dedicated military and civilian medical professionals in the Military Health System 
(MHS), which provides direct support to our combatant commanders and delivers health care for 
our 9.6 million beneficiaries.  
This hearing is occurring in advance of the formal release of the President’s FY22  full  
budget. My testimony will provide the Subcommittee with information on major activities that 
will inform our budget proposal for FY22 as well as issues affecting FY21 execution. The most 
significant issue, looming over all of our projections, is the national response to the COVID-19 
pandemic.  Our national success in reducing the spread of the virus, and vaccinating our 
population, will affect every aspect of our health care costs. For that reason, my testimony will 
begin with the current state of the DoD response to COVID-19. 
COVID-19 Response 
The past fourteen months have represented a unique and challenging period for our 
Nation as we’ve confronted and responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. In line with the 
President’s priorities, Secretary Austin has made clear that the greatest proximate challenge to 
our Nation's security is the threat of COVID-19. The Department has, and will continue to, act 
boldly and quickly to support Federal government efforts to defeat this disease. The MHS is 
providing critical health support worldwide to our military forces, supporting other Federal and 
state entities as part of a whole-of-government response to this crisis, and continuing to meet 
  2
other strategic, global mission requirements, while sustaining high quality health services to our 
military Service members and their families. 
Beginning with the declaration of a global pandemic in March 2020, the MHS provided 
essential crisis response services in support of military leaders and civilian demands.  Though 
this summary is not all-inclusive, I will briefly mention several critical initiatives that contributed 
to the national response and also generated additional expenditures for the Department. 
Surveillance and Laboratory Testing.  Soon after the pandemic began, the Secretary of 
Defense established the DoD Coronavirus Task Force that included a Diagnostics and Testing 
Line of Effort.  The Department grew its laboratory testing capacity from 16 operational 
laboratories in late March 2020 to 189 operational laboratories by March 2021, and increased 
on-hand SARS-COV-2 tests from approximately 200,000 to over 1.8 million.  To date, the 
Department has conducted well over 3 million tests and has tests on-hand to conduct more than 
100K tests per week. Testing is a key public health intervention that has helped to limit the 
spread of SARS-COV-2 within the military. Coupled with other public health measures like 
social distancing and masking, military installations have consistently lower positivity rates 
than their surrounding communities.  
Even as vaccination efforts continue to increase, testing will remain a key pillar of our 
public health strategy to battle this disease and maintain a ready force. Screening through 
antigen and PCR testing using a variety of testing strategies in a post-vaccination environment 
will continue as part of the Department’s COVID-19 risk mitigation strategy to drive cases 
down toward zero. The Department is also committed to whole genome sequencing and 
identification of variants of concern and interest and to understanding their prevalence among 
  3
our Service members and other beneficiaries. The Department has already committed the 
resources and funding to more than double the number of specimens the Department can 
sequence and analyze each week. 
Clinical Support for Treatment and Therapeutics.  Early in the COVID response, the 
Defense Health Agency (DHA) developed and released the first DoD COVID-19 Practice 
Management Guide (PMG) to provide clinicians and Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs)- our 
military clinics and hospitals- with a single document on best practices informed by the latest 
evidence, and guidance across all clinical care specialties.  The PMG has been continually 
updated and rereleased, with the most recent version (Version 7) published in March 2021. The 
DHA also established a Joint Registry for COVID-19. Using the Joint Trauma Registry as a 
foundation for this effort, the COVID Registry collects and assesses clinical information on 
COVID patients,  in order to inform our military medical community on the rapidly evolving 
science behind this disease.  In April 2020, DHA also put forth the Health Protection Condition 
(HPCON) Guidance in a COVID-19 Environment, which contained CDC informed guidance to 
support MTFs in healthcare delivery in response to COVID-19, based on the locally-determined 
risk level.  
In June 2020, DHA began an effort to collect donated units of plasma from patients who 
had fully recovered from COVID-19 to support development of an effective treatment against 
the disease.  Again, the DHA relied on the COVID-19 registry to identify potential donors, as 
well as capture the use of, and outcomes from, convalescent plasma on hospitalized COVID 
patients. In August 2020, after receiving Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from FDA, 
COVID-19 convalescent plasma was made available to MTFs for investigational treatment of 
COVID-positive patients who met established criteria in accordance with approved protocols.   
  4
The MHS worked closely to implement other, FDA-approved treatments for COVID. In 
September 2020, shortly after Veklury® (remdesivir; first FDA-approved treatment for COVID-
19) received an expanded EUA, the medication was rapidly pre-positioned throughout DoD to 
ensure availability to hospitalized patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 
irrespective of their severity of disease.  Similarly, in November 2020, after receiving an EUA 
from FDA for COVID-19 monoclonal antibody treatment, DHA developed and disseminated 
specialized guidance to assist MTFs and healthcare providers regarding patient care 
considerations when administering this treatment for mild and moderate cases.   
Individual Medical Readiness. COVID-19 did affect medical readiness within the 
military.  The Department uses a concept called Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) to measure 
medical readiness, which consists of six elements. These are Dental Readiness, Immunizations, 
Medical Readiness Labs, Deployment-Limiting Medical Condition (DLMC) Status, Periodic 
Health Assessment (PHA), and Individual Medical Equipment.  In 2015, the DoD Total Force 
Medically Ready (TFMR) goal was set at 85%.  Since 2015, the Total Force has consistently met 
or exceeded the 85% goal.  With COVID-19 pandemic beginning in the 2nd quarter of 2020, 
TFMR decreased below the Department’s 85% goal. As of the 4th Quarter of Calendar Year 
2020, TFMR compliance was 82.2%; Active Component IMR compliance was 82.4% and 
Reserve Component IMR compliance was 81.7%. 
The COVID-19 pandemic most affected Dental Readiness and Immunizations.  These 
IMR requirements can only be completed via in-person clinic visits.  Of note, throughout the 
pandemic, medical readiness for deploying Service Members was prioritized and all personnel 
are required to be fully medically ready prior to deployment.  Capabilities such as virtual and 
telephonic medical appointments allowed MTFs to continue to provide access to medical 
  5
readiness support services. We expect IMR rates to quickly recover and return to pre-COVID 
levels as our vaccination campaign proceeds through spring and summer 2021.  
Healthcare Delivery and Deferred Medical Care. In both the direct care system and 
the TRICARE network, the Department has worked to ensure beneficiaries receive medically 
necessary and readiness-related care throughout the pandemic and we are currently working to 
address delayed or deferred care. In addition to guidance for MTFs on standard processes to 
provide medically necessary care that could not be delayed, the Department significantly 
expanded the use of Virtual Health (VH) to meet beneficiary demand while minimizing 
unnecessary risks for patients and staff. 
MTFs and Markets are increasing the number of available appointments to meet patient 
demand for care and schedule previously delayed care.  Despite additional workload associated 
with COVID-related deployments and vaccinations, MTF appointment availability is 
approaching pre-pandemic levels and access to appointments for routine and follow-up care 
averages 4.8 days, which is better than the standard of 7.0 days or fewer.  Likewise, specialty 
referrals are up from spring 2020 levels and are approaching pre-pandemic rates.  While direct 
care performance on cancer and other preventive screening is lagging compared to strong pre-
pandemic performance, MTF staff members are actively reaching out to beneficiaries to 
encourage and facilitate screening appointments.   
For network care, DHA worked with the managed care support contractors to develop 
strategies to ensure our beneficiaries’ ability to access care in the network, ensured resources 
were monitored to confirm provider availability, expanded availability of VH and eased 
  6
beneficiary access to providers by extending referral and authorization limits and adjusting rules 
impacting beneficiary cost shares. 
Public Health Planning. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of 
integrated DoD and interagency public health planning, which includes conducting realistic 
exercises with federal, state and local public health partners.  However, the MHS pivoted quickly 
and effectively in responding to the pandemic across a wide range of requirements, both internal 
to DoD and across the public health universe. In the process, we learned lessons and developed 
associated recommendations that can have an immediate and sustained impact on the ability of 
the MHS to support the ongoing pandemic and to prepare for future major public health 
emergencies. Chief among these actions is developing even tighter integrated coordination with 
interagency partners such as the National Institute of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other organizations regarding 
global medical surveillance of cases and variants of concern.  As a primary partner in the 
interagency scientific community, DoD shares genetic sequencing, seroprevalence information 
and other relevant surveillance data with interagency partners.   
Medical Education & Training. The collaborative leadership efforts of the Medical 
Enlisted Training Campus and the Services resulted in minimal disruptions in training by 
maximizing the interoperability and capabilities of alternative learning modalities and 
technology adoption. The MHS kept graduation rates on target, and the end-strength of enlisted 
medical career fields healthy and ready to support Combatant Commanders.  Additionally, the 
MHS expanded support for continuing education credits (CE) for 16 healthcare specialties and 
awarded over 90 thousand continuing education/medical credits. Continuing education credits 
are required for health professional licensure and certifications.  The Defense Medical Modeling 
  7
and Simulation Office recognized an opportunity to provide immediate support in meeting 
COVID-19 related simulation training gaps/needs of the transitioned Markets and associated 
Military Medical Treatment Facilities.  
COVID-19 Vaccine and Immunization Implementation. Since December 2020, the 
Department introduced a global immunization campaign to deliver expanding supplies of 
vaccines approved for use under an EUA.   In December 2020, DHA issued a DHA Interim 
Procedures Memorandum to implement instructions, assign responsibilities, and prescribe 
procedures for the COVID-19 Vaccination Program.  DHA continues to issue updates on the 
coordinated strategy for prioritizing, distributing, and administering the COVID-19 vaccine, with 
the most recent DoD Vaccination Plan modification (MOD-12) released in April 2021. 
As of April 16, 2021, the Department had administered over 2.5 million doses of the three 
vaccines authorized by the FDA under an EUA. However, on April 14th, DoD implemented the 
CDC and FDA recommendation to pause administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine until 
federal health experts conclude their review of the rare, severe adverse events that have occurred 
in a small number of individuals. Although DoD was distributing all of its Johnson & Johnson 
vaccine to overseas locations, the Moderna vaccine still represented the majority of our overseas 
allocation. If this pause extends beyond several weeks, DoD will consider adjusting its current 
allocations to accommodate our overseas requirements. 
Adapted from the CDC tiered framework for prioritizing individuals for vaccination, the 
DoD population schema includes persons in critical national security positions and deploying 
forces in the Tier 1 priorities.  Vaccinations are being administered at 350 DoD sites around the 
world, in addition to access to civilian sources for our beneficiaries.  On April 19, 2021, the 
  8
Department fully opened vaccine appointments to all eligible individuals, consistent with the 
President’s direction to all jurisdictions.  
The vaccine remains voluntary for all eligible persons to include active duty Service 
members. The Department has implemented a comprehensive outreach and communications 
effort to encourage all eligible persons seek out these highly safe and effective vaccines. We are 
encouraged by the trends in vaccine acceptance, and are confident that all individuals over the 
age of 15 who want the vaccine will be fully vaccinated by mid-Summer.  
Defense Support to Civilian Authorities.  In addition to the comprehensive response in 
support of the military mission, the Defense Department has provided significant expertise, 
logistics support, and personnel to civilian communities.  Early in the pandemic, the DHA 
coordinated the delivery of critical inventory from existing strategic reserves to the Department 
of Health and Human Services for redistribution to civilian communities. This support included 
delivery of  five million N-95 masks and over two thousand ventilators. The US Navy deployed 
the USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy to civilian ports on the east and west coasts to provide 
hospital bed surge capacity for cities in crisis. Throughout 2020, Army, Navy and Air Force 
personnel deployed as units to civilian hospitals around the country to augment local staff. 
Military medical personnel took on key positions with Operation Warp Speed, and infectious 
disease experts and medical researchers from DoD medical research and development offices 
collaborated closely with the broader American medical research community.  
COVID-19 After Action Review (AAR). The MHS is a learning organization, and we are 
committed to continuously improving our performance – whether in  battlefield medicine, health 
care quality and safety, or our COVID response efforts. Consistent with the FY21 NDAA, 
  9
Section 731, the MHS established a rigorous AAR process, led by the Uniformed Services 
University of the Health Sciences. This AAR builds on the MHS interim AAR process and report 
established by the ASD(HA) in May 2020 and completed in January 2021.  The Department will 
submit a substantive, interim report to Congress under Section 731 by 1 June, and submit a final 
report by the close of 2021.  
Effects on the FY21 Budget. We remain deeply appreciative of the FY20 supplemental 
appropriation of $2.2 billion, as part of the CARES Act, that covered the significant costs 
incurred during our initial response.   
In FY21, however, costs attributable to the pandemic response continue to accumulate. As 
of March 31, 2021, our mid-year review of the Defense Health Program (DHP) identified likely 
shortfalls as part of the ongoing pandemic response, which we are working with the Department 
to resolve. In addition, the financial impact of our military support to the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) missions, which remain ongoing, continue to be assessed.  The 
most significant cost drivers include higher than projected Private Sector Care costs; additional 
laboratory testing; personal protective equipment (PPE) expenditures; and numerous other 
requirements from public health surveillance to antiseptic cleaning of medical facilities.  
While there are opportunities to realign funds to meet the operational imperative of 
the pandemic response, actions will still create additional risk and financial liability at a later 
date. 
MHS REFORMS and TRANSITION 
The FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) enacted sweeping reforms to 
the organization and management of military medicine. The over-arching direction from 
  10
Congress was to centralize and standardize many military health care functions in a way that 
better integrates readiness and health delivery throughout the Department. Included among these 
reforms: the expanded authority and responsibility of the DHA to manage MTFs worldwide; and 
the authority to adjust medical infrastructure in the MHS to maintain readiness and core 
competencies of health care providers.  
Following a strategic pause in transition activities due to  the initial COVID-19 pandemic 
response, which was directed and then lifted by the Secretary of Defense in April and November 
2020 respectively, the MHS has continued executing the transition of Military Medical 
Treatment Facilities (MTF) to DHA management in accordance with the Department’s approved, 
conditions-based execution plan that meets the intent of Section 702 of the FY17 NDAA.  
In the coming weeks, we expect to certify all Wave 1 Market Offices (i.e, San Antonio, 
Tidewater, Colorado, Puget Sound, and Hawaii).  These critical markets account for 34 percent 
of the MHS’ dispositions, 48 percent of the MHS’s direct care expenditures, and 11 percent of 
the MHS’s purchased care expenditures -- providing tremendous opportunities for continued 
standardization and optimization.  Wave 2 Market Establishment planning is underway, and we 
plan to institute an intermediate headquarters to manage the remainder of our small hospitals and 
clinics in early June.  There are still outstanding personnel transfer issues to resolve, however, 
that place at risk our ability to complete this transition by the congressionally established 
deadline of September 30, 2021. 
Section 703 of the FY2016 NDAA directed the Secretary of Defense to submit to the 
congressional defense committees an implementation plan to restructure or realign military 
medical treatment facilities.  This report was transmitted to Congress on February 19, 2020. The 
  11
report articulated the DoD’s decisions to align MTFs to increase the readiness of our operational 
and medical forces and achieve a proper balance between meeting readiness requirements and 
managing the total cost of health care in the direct and purchased care systems.  
All restructuring efforts were paused on April 2, 2020 as a result of the resources required 
to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Department is revalidating the assumptions made 
regarding its readiness requirements prior to the pandemic, as well as the assessment of network 
capacity to absorb additional patients where we intend to proceed with right-sizing plans.  The 
DHA will take a conditions-based approach to any transition of medical services. In other words, 
transition will only occur when we are certain that local TRICARE networks can provide timely 
and quality access to health care. If they cannot, we will revise our plans.  
MHS GENESIS IMPLEMENTATION 
The Department continues to proceed with the multi-year implementation of its new, 
Electronic Health Record (EHR), MHS GENESIS.  Although we paused a number of specific, 
in-person activities during the COVID-19 response, we still delivered the two Waves scheduled 
for completion in 2020, two currently in 2021, and remain on schedule for enterprise completion 
in 2023.  As of today, MHS GENESIS supports the delivery of safe, high-quality data to patients 
and providers across 20 MTFs.  
The value of MHS GENESIS has become even more apparent during the COVID-19 
response.  We were able to implement COVID-specific configuration changes in MHS 
GENESIS within hours on several occasions that provided senior military and civilian leaders 
with timely information on COVID laboratory testing results and the health of our force and our 
beneficiaries; the same changes in our legacy systems took nearly four weeks to implement.  
  12
MHS GENESIS’ mass vaccination capabilities have produced a significant improved 
workflow that allows the Military Departments to assess the status of service member 
inoculations in order to ensure readiness. For example, medical personnel at Twentynine Palms, 
California successfully screened 700 active duty Marine records within days of going live with 
MHS GENESIS in September. The process was so successful that Cerner made the solution part 
of its baseline product for commercial use. 
DoD and VA continue to closely collaborate on a fully integrated EHR with the oversight of 
the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office.  The Departments 
collaborated with the FEHRM to launch the joint health information exchange (joint HIE) in 
April 2020, creating  a single common gateway through which DOD and VA providers can send 
data to and retrieve data from participating private sector partners. With the FEHRM’s 
leadership, the Departments support a Federal Enclave providing a single, common record with 
high cybersecurity standards, joint configuration boards to ensure standardized workflows, and 
shared risks, schedules and lessons learned. 
TRICARE 5th Generation Contracts (T-5) 
The Department continues to manage the TRICARE Program in a manner that seeks to 
reduce the growth in health care costs while ensuring our health benefit remains an exceptional 
tool for recruitment and retention of military personnel and their families. Among the most 
important strategies we pursue is the development of effective TRICARE contracts that deliver 
high-value, patient-centric care designed to seamlessly integrate military and private sector care 
in support of readiness and health outcomes.   
The T-5 contracts represent the next generation of contracts that provide DHA with the 
flexibility to adjust network requirements, improve professional services support, and adapt care 
  13
delivery models in support of evolving mission requirements and changes in American health 
care delivery.  After an extensive, multi-year engagement with Department leaders, industry, and 
other stakeholders, as well as three draft Requests for Proposal (RFPs) shared with industry, the 
Department issued the T-5 RFP on April 9, 2021.   The goals of this procurement support (1) 
military medical readiness and the readiness of the medical force;  (2) beneficiary choice; (3) 
high value care; and the adoption of Industry Business Standards.  
The Department looks forward to healthy competition from industry and the inclusion of 
new health care delivery models in the coming proposals.  As part of the T-5 process, the 
Department will conduct “Competitive Demonstrations” during the contract’s period of 
performance.  Twenty-one potential markets are identified in geographic areas where MTFs may 
rightsize, downsize or where DHA provides TRICARE Prime but no MTF exists.  The RFP also 
specifies three innovations: Virtual Value Networks, Advanced Primary Care, and Care 
Collaboration Tools that will start with T-5 initiation and up to seven other demonstrations are 
planned during the life of the contract. DHA anticipates receipt of offeror proposals no later than 
August 13, 2021.  The new contracts are planned to begin health care delivery in Calendar Year 
2024. 
MEDICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
The Department is grateful for the long-term advocacy and support for its military 
medical research program. The DHP research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) focus 
is to advance the state of medical science in those areas of most pressing need and relevance to 
today’s emerging threats, which includes the COVID-19 pandemic.  
  14
We seek to discover and explore innovative approaches to protect and support the 
readiness, health, and welfare of military personnel; to accelerate the transition of medical 
technologies to development and acquisition; and to accelerate the translation of advances in 
knowledge into new standards of care and treatment that can be applied in the field or in military 
medical treatment facilities.  
In the coming years, we hope to leverage new technologies to include artificial intelligence 
and machine learning, biotechnology, and autonomous systems. The goal is to accelerate the 
transition of medical technologies to development and acquisition programs, and to further the 
translation of new standards of care to support and treatment that can be applied in the field or in 
military medical treatment facilities. We will seek to mitigate deployment-limiting medical 
conditions for service members by focusing on injury prevention and rehabilitation. 
  The MHS continue to employ and strengthen our enterprise-wide performance 
management systems that provide stakeholders – both medical and line leadership – at all levels 
of the military with visibility into how we are performing on key metrics.  These dashboards 
show longitudinal performance in measures of readiness, health, access, quality, safety and cost.  
We monitor critical indicators of quality and safety – – that point us toward high reliability as a 
system of care. Access to primary care and specialty care are measured along with patient 
satisfaction to ensure we are meeting patient expectations. We have provided Department 
leadership, MTF commanders and staff with visibility into COVID-19 specific measures that 
include, but are not limited to operational hospital bed capacity and surge capabilities, timely 
laboratory test results, PPE inventories, COVID-19 vaccine target population and vaccine 
administration data, as well as important private sector care data. 
  15
Our dashboards can be viewed at an enterprise level, by Service, by market, and by 
individual hospital or clinic. We will continue to adapt this management system as the MTF 
transition progresses. Commanders can assess their performance against expected benchmarks, 
against peer institutions, and – where possible – against civilian sector performance as well.  
These dashboards help us to both assess how we are doing in these areas, and where we need to 
invest resources, training, or management attention in order to achieve further improvement.   
OTHER SIGNIFICANT HEALTH INITIATIVES 
There are several other health initiatives that merit comment – chief among these is 
access to timely, high quality mental health services and related activities to reduce the incidence 
of suicide among our service members, their families, and all beneficiaries.  The Department is 
committed to the health, welfare and safety of our service members and families and we have 
undertaken a broad-based campaign encouraging service members to seek mental health 
treatment when signs or symptoms occur, help service members and their families to identify 
those signs and symptoms, and to de-stigmatize mental health care overall. 
The DoD has invested in a number of programs to increase access to mental health care 
for Service members who are experiencing symptoms of a psychological health condition. 
Service members are eligible to receive free, comprehensive behavioral health care (including 
clinical assessment, psychotherapy, and psychiatric treatment) at their local military medical 
treatment facilities. We also have programs that embed psychological health providers in 
operational units to assist Service members in their everyday work environments.  The primary 
care medical homes provide follow-up when Service members disclose psychological health 
concerns to their primary care provider. Military OneSource is our 24/7 resource to connect 
  16
Service members to information about their psychological health, non-medical counseling for 
stress management, and referrals to healthcare providers.  
We have witnessed significant improvements in destigmatization and increased use of 
behavioral health services. Nonetheless, suicide rates remain unacceptably high. Suicide is a very 
complex issue with many biological, social, and psychological factors that contribute to suicide. 
In recognition of this complexity, the DoD implements a comprehensive public health approach 
to suicide prevention and intervention. The DoD is focused on using every available resource to 
support our Service members. 
For example Service members are screened for symptoms of psychological health 
conditions throughout their service. All Service members who are deployed in connection with 
a contingency operation receive a series of deployment health screenings designed to identify 
psychological health concerns, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that may require 
referral for additional care and treatment.  Additionally, all Service members, regardless of 
deployment status, receive a mental health assessment upon separation from military service to 
ensure documentation of any psychological health conditions and arrange for appropriate 
follow-up. 
Currently the DoD and VA are working together in the development of a single 
Separation Health Assessment that will include a Mental Health Assessment.  This effort will 
make the separation process more efficient and improve the mental health care of our Service 
members. Clinical Practice Guidelines have been formulated for all major clinical conditions in 
mental health, and Joint VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) for mental health care 
  17
facilitate delivery of evidence-based mental health care practices and strengthen the ability to 
maintain mental health readiness. 
Beyond individual approaches, the public health approach also includes broader efforts, 
such as those targeted for our populations of greatest concern (young and enlisted Service 
members) and developing initiatives to support military families.  For example, current efforts 
include interactive educational pilot programs to teach foundational skills to effectively deal 
with life stressors and to address help-seeking concerns and encourage use of support resources.  
The Department continues to promote initiatives that increase awareness of risk factors 
for suicide, safe storage of lethal means (e.g., firearms and medications), and communicate how 
to intervene in a crisis.  For example, DoD trained more than 2,000 non-medical military 
providers to provide Counseling on Access to Lethal Means (CALM) to Service members and 
families to increase awareness of risk factors for suicide, safe storage of lethal means (e.g., 
firearms, medications, and other lethal means), and how to intervene in a crisis.  DoD is 
expanding on this pilot program for other influencers, such as spouses.  
OVERALL FY22 BUDGET  
 
  The soon-to-be released budget will prioritize our resource requirements to address the 
COVID-19 pandemic and also address health care delivery challenges caused by the pandemic.  
The Defense Health Program funding level that will be proposed by the Department in 
the FY 2022 President’s Budget re-baselines health care program resources based on FY 2020 
execution prior to the onset of COVID.  Some residual risks remain, such as the COVID-related 
effects of previously delayed care that may return, potentially deleterious impacts on 
beneficiaries’ health due to delaying or forgoing care, unrecognized impacts of COVID-19 
  18
among asymptomatic or long-term, persistent disease, and the inherent uncertainty in predicting 
healthcare costs. 
The MHS is not unique in the variability associated with predicting health care costs as all 
health insurers face these same challenges when forecasting their health expenditures for a given 
year. Changes in medical practice, demand for services, and new procedures and drugs are hard 
to predict. COVID has only exacerbated these challenges.  
It is important to consider the FY22 budget request in the context of MHS cost control for 
the last ten years. Over the period of FY 2012 to FY 2018, both private health insurance 
premiums and National Health Expenditures per capita rose 25% (or 3.7% annually).  However, 
the Department, working with Congress, instituted a series of initiatives that reduced DoD costs 
well below the rate of civilian growth.  A combination of benefit changes, payment savings 
initiatives, contract changes, and population reductions masked underlying increases in health 
care costs.  Starting in FY 2019, cost patterns returned to normal growth until the COVID 
pandemic significantly reduced the utilization of health care services beginning in March 2020.  
The Department continues to pursue efforts focused on internal business process 
improvements and structural changes to find greater efficiencies, such as further integrating and 
standardizing the operation of hospitals and clinics; continuing the deployment of MHS 
GENESIS; modernizing clinical and business processes; and, streamlining internal operations. 
The Department is not requesting any additional changes to beneficiary cost-sharing in the FY22 
budget.   
The Department remains vigilant about variation in year-to-year expenditures, and we are 
appreciative that Congress continues to grant the Department carryover authority each year. 
Carryover authority allows DoD to maintain better funding flows to minimize disruption of 
  19
health care services to our beneficiaries. We are committed to making our health care cost 
projections even more transparent in the year of execution, providing regular updates to the 
committee, and providing full visibility to Congress on potential plans for reprogramming funds 
within the fiscal year should that possibility unfold.  Furthermore, we will ensure that available 
funding is directed toward unfunded medical readiness and health care delivery requirements.  
Carryover authority is an invaluable tool that provides the Department with needed flexibility to 
manage issues that emerge during the year of budget execution.   
When released, our FY22 budget will present a balanced, comprehensive strategy that 
aligns with the Secretary’s priorities, to include the ongoing response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, and continues to fulfill our requirements associated with our congressionally directed 
transition.  We look forward to working with you over the coming months to further refine and 
articulate our objectives in a manner that improves value for everyone – our warfighters, our 
combatant commanders, our patients, our medical force, and the American taxpayer. 
Thank you for inviting me here today to speak with you about military medicine and our 
response to the global pandemic, the essential integration between readiness and health, and 
about our plans to further improve our health system in support of the National Defense Strategy 
and for our beneficiary population.

Introduction 
Chairman Blunt, Ranking Member Murray and distinguished members of this 
subcommittee. It is an honor to appear before you today to discuss the Department of Health and 
Human Services’ ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We are grateful for this 
opportunity to address how each of our agencies and offices are harnessing innovation to 
prevent, diagnose, and treat the novel coronavirus SARs-CoV-2. 
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not 
previously been seen in humans. This new disease, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19), is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  There are many types of human 
coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. 
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses.  Some cause illness in people, and others, such as 
canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, coronaviruses that infect animals 
have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred 
for the virus that causes COVID-19.  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated in 
animals and then spread to people. 
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is working closely with all of our 
government partners in this response.  Congress passed the Coronavirus Preparedness and 
Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020; the Families First Coronavirus Response Act; 
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act; and the Paycheck Protection 
Program and Health Care Enhancement Act.  These laws have provided additional resources, 
authorities, and flexibility. Within HHS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
the Assistant Secretary for Health, and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response 
along with additional components not represented today, play critical roles in the response to this 
public health emergency as discussed below.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
CDC is America’s health protection agency, and works 24/7 to prevent illness, save lives 
and protect America from health, safety and security threats. CDC has a key role in preparedness 
and response in the U.S. and abroad.  Addressing infectious diseases like COVID-19 is central to 
our mission and CDC has decades of leadership in infectious disease response.   
 When there is an emerging pathogen like the SARS-COV2 virus, CDC expertise lies in 
our ability to study the new pathogen to understand how it is transmitted, and translate that 
knowledge into public health action.  Since first learning of the cluster of cases in Wuhan, CDC 
has rapidly advanced the science around this new human pathogen, SARS-CoV-2.  CDC has 
both been on the forefront of understanding this new disease and led the nation’s efforts to 
protect Americans from infection. Currently, over 6,700 CDC employees have been engaged in 
the agency’s COVID-19 response, and over 1,200 of these staff have been deployed to nearly 
200 different locations in the U.S. and abroad.  CDC staff have conducted rapid investigations of 
outbreaks that identified highest-risk priority populations and settings.  Understanding specific 
population-level vulnerabilities and how infections spread in various types of settings has been 
instrumental in the development of guidance that will help keep the American people healthy and 
allow critical infrastructure services to be provided safely.  
The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), sometimes called the “voice of 
CDC,” has published more than 100 COVID-19 reports since the beginning of the pandemic, 
providing cutting-edge scientific articles that have been viewed by tens of millions of readers. 
These reports have provided the public, scientists, healthcare workers, and policymakers critical 
information about the virus, how it spreads, and the communities it has impacted. MMWR 
reports yielded the earliest descriptions of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission of 
the virus and elucidated the substantial risk of transmission at large gatherings, choir practices, 
and congregate living situations including nursing homes, prisons and jails, homeless shelters, 
and camps for children. They have described the disparate impact of COVID-19 in racial and 
ethnic minorities and identified the elevated risk of severe outcomes for older adults and people 
with underlying conditions. Finally, MMWR reports have indicated what successful control of 
the virus looks like, through careful mitigation efforts in everyday high-risk settings such as hair 
3 
 
 
salons and childcare centers. In short, MMWR’s rapid publication of the highest quality science 
has laid the foundation of what we know about COVID-19 and illuminated the way forward. 
In addition to publishing our own scientific information, CDC scientists are monitoring in 
real time the rapidly expanding scientific literature and have reviewed over 100,000 scientific 
papers thus far. This approach ensures that CDC responders are armed with the best information 
available.  This comprehensive understanding of the emerging science base helps direct CDC’s 
scientific agenda and informs CDC guidance, and helps guide CDC’s direct support of clinicians 
and the public.  CDC’s Clinical Response Line has fielded over 32,000 individual inquiries from 
frontline healthcare providers, and the agency’s hotline for public inquiries has responded to 
nearly 500,000 calls and e-mails.   
CDC is drawing on its emergency response capacity and its relationships with state, 
tribal, local, and territorial (STLT), global, and private sector partners; and is leveraging our 
workforce’s strengths in public health surveillance, prevention, and laboratory capacity to carry 
out research and share new knowledge related to this novel pathogen and its consequences.  CDC 
provides guidance for healthcare professionals, essential workers, businesses, schools, and the 
public to encourage safer practices, improve health outcomes, and save lives.  CDC works with 
partners to develop decision tools to assist STLT officials and other stakeholders with mitigation 
strategies. Importantly, CDC is preparing the nation’s public health system and the private sector 
to disseminate a vaccine when one is available.  CDC is leveraging investments in global health 
security and pandemic influenza preparedness infrastructures in over 60 countries to mitigate the 
effects of COVID-19 and stop the disease from spreading.   
As of September 9, 2020, there have been 6,310,633 COVID-19 cases reported and 
189,147 deaths attributed to the virus in the U.S. The latest data can be found on CDC’s website: 
https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html.  The U.S. Government has taken 
unprecedented action to address the public health threat posed by this new coronavirus. CDC has 
substantial supplemental funding to help respond to this pandemic at home and abroad.  This 
funding supports a federally guided, state managed, and locally implemented response to 
COVID-19 in the United States.   
With funds provided by the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental 
Appropriations Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, 
4 
 
 
CDC is providing states with needed resources needed to detect, respond, and prevent the spread 
of COVID-19 and to inform community mitigation strategies.   
CDC’s highest priority is to ensure that STLT public health programs have the resources 
they need to address the COVID-19 pandemic.  These jurisdictions are best positioned to 
understand the unique situation of each community, including the status of their public health 
infrastructure and workforce and its needs for enhancement. CDC is supporting STLT partners 
who are working to identify cases; conduct contact tracing; implement containment measures 
and mitigate spread in the community. CDC is working alongside these health departments to 
improve surveillance and reporting and enhance testing capacity.  Together, STLT and CDC 
teams are responding to COVID-19 outbreaks in high-risk settings and implementing best 
practices to control the spread.   
As a public health agency and the nation’s primary resource for STLT health departments 
on managing disease outbreaks, CDC provides guidance and support on the development and 
implementation of effective containment and community mitigation strategies. The goal is for all 
jurisdictions to have robust public health systems which include a contact tracing infrastructure 
that meets their unique needs. As of September 2020, CDC has posted over 30 contact tracing 
guidance documents, including case investigation guidelines, checklists for developing a case 
investigation and contact tracing plan, digital contact tracing tools, and a Contact Tracing 
Communications Toolkit for Health Departments. To support these activities, described in 
further detail below, CDC has awarded $12.1 billion to these entities in FY 2020, including 
$10.25 billion in funds executed on behalf of HHS to be used primarily to support each 
jurisdiction’s testing goals (as outlined in state testing plans).   
Testing Strategy 
Beginning in April, the White House, and Federal partners including CDC, convened 
calls with all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia to identify testing capacities 
and needs. Through these calls and other outreach efforts, CDC has worked with individual 
jurisdictions to identify needs, develop plans, and offer technical assistance to enhance testing 
capacity. CDC, under the leadership of the Office of Assistant Secretary for Health and in 
collaboration with the Association of Public Health Laboratories, reviewed individual state 
testing plans with a focus on achieving increased monthly testing targets. These discussions and 
5 
 
 
plans for action emphasized the need to serve vulnerable populations and include focused efforts 
for long-term care facilities, federally qualified health centers, and Tribal Nations, among others. 
CDC is working with STLT health departments to support forward-looking testing 
strategies that ensure that vulnerable or high-risk populations, such as some racial and ethnic 
minorities, have adequate access to testing. For example, CDC worked with the Health 
Resources and Services Administration and health centers to survey health centers and better 
understand the populations they are serving. Approximately 60 percent of responding FQHCs are 
in urban areas, where persons of Hispanic or Latinx ethnicity were the largest proportion of 
individuals testing positive. This information allows STLT health departments to implement 
strategies to increase testing in FQHCs and provide them with the tools and resources to 
diagnose, treat, and monitor COVID-19 illness in the populations they serve.    
  CDC has developed a new multiplex laboratory test that checks for three viruses at the 
same time, two types of influenza viruses (A and B) and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes 
COVID-19, using a single sample collected from an individual. Testing for all three viruses will 
allow public health laboratories to continue surveillance for influenza while testing for COVID-
19.  This will save public health laboratories both time and resources, including testing materials 
that are in short supply.  Another benefit of the new test is that laboratories will be better able to 
find co-infections of influenza and SARS-COV-2.  The FDA issued an Emergency Use 
Authorization (EUA) for this combined laboratory test on July 2, 2020 and CDC released these 
reagents for distribution to states’ public health laboratories on August 5, 2020.  As of August 
17, 2020, 135 multiplex kits were shipped to more than 100 laboratories.  Each of these kits 
provides approximately 500 tests. Adjusting for the controls, these 135 kits provide 
approximately 67,000 tests.  CDC has provided these kits to each state’s or territory’s main 
public health laboratory, as well as any regional or local laboratories that is approved to provide 
SARS-CoV-2 surge testing support.  Importantly, multiplex assay technical information is 
publicly available on CDC’s website so that commercial developers can use this information in 
developing proprietary tests.  CDC also granted assay manufacturers right of reference to its 
EUA, allowing developers to use the data CDC submitted to FDA to streamline their efforts 
when applying for an EUA. CDC took these steps to catalyze the development and validation of 
these assays by the commercial sector which is better equipped to scale up testing capacity.  
6 
 
 
In March 2020, CDC and public health partners began seroprevalence surveys of 
community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.  Seroprevalence surveys help identify infections that 
might be missed due to lack of symptoms or testing not being performed.  Serology studies can 
also help determine risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including transmission 
in health care settings and communities, and inform guidance and mitigation strategies. For 
example, CDC has published the results from one of the seroprevalence studies that used 
remnants of samples collected during routine clinical care. This was done in conjunction with 
two commercial companies and results suggested that greater than 10 times more SARS-CoV-2 
infections occurred than the number of reported COVID-19 cases. Another study on healthcare 
personnel who routinely cared for COVID-19 patients found that 6 percent had evidence of 
previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study identified two factors potentially associated with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCP: personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages and not 
wearing a mask while interacting with patients.  
Data Collection, Analysis and Understanding of the Pandemic 
Accurate data are critical as we continue to assess the burden placed on the American 
healthcare system to inform reopening.  CDC is leveraging all available surveillance systems, 
including influenza and viral respiratory disease systems, to monitor COVID-19 and protect 
vulnerable communities. These data collected by CDC help target critical COVID-19 
interventions.  In collaboration with STLT public health partners, CDC is committed to making 
data available to the public, while protecting individual privacy.  
This crisis has highlighted the need to continue efforts to modernize the public health 
data systems that CDC and states rely on for accurate data. Public health data surveillance and 
analytical infrastructure modernization efforts started in FY 2020.  Timely and accurate data are 
essential as CDC and the nation work to understand the impact of COVID-19 on all Americans, 
particularly for populations at greater risk for severe illness, such as older Americans, those with 
chronic medical conditions, and some racial and ethnic minorities. Modernization efforts include 
support for surveillance and data workforce, a key asset of the public health system. For 
example, CDC is working closely with our partners to help STLT health departments implement 
the Sara Alert system. Sara Alert is a standards-based, open source tool that increases 
interoperability among laboratory and clinical systems and automates the process of public 
7 
 
 
health monitoring and reporting individuals exposed to or infected with COVID-19.   To date, 
eleven states and territories, along with nine jurisdictions including one Tribal Nation, have 
adopted the Sara Alert system. Twenty additional jurisdictions including two territories are in 
progress of or considering joining.  At the current level of participation during an average 10-14 
day timeframe, approximately 80,000 individuals areeither entering, being monitored by or 
exiting the system .  
CDC’s population-based COVID-NET system monitors COVID-19 associated 
hospitalizations that have a confirmed positive test in greater than 250 acute care hospitals in 99 
counties in 14 states.  Data gathered provide weekly estimates for age-specific hospitalization 
rates and describe characteristics of persons hospitalized with COVID-19 illness as well as 
predictors of those with more severe outcomes.  CDC’s existing National Healthcare Safety 
Network (NHSN) continues to collect COVID-19 data from nursing homes and other long-term 
care facilities.  NHSN also continues to collect data from hospitals across the U.S. to address 
healthcare-associated infections and fight against antibiotic resistance.    
  The COVID-19 Case Report Form includes variables such as race and ethnicity to enable 
identification of populations that may be at higher risk for severe illness and risk factors.   
Though states are not required to report demographic information in the Case Report Form, they 
have improved the completeness of their reporting. In particular, the percentage of reports that 
include race data has increased from 21 percent in April to 61 percent in mid-August, while the 
percentage of reports that include ethnicity data increased from 18 percent to 50 percent during 
the same time period. While progress has been made, CDC will continue to work with states and 
other health system partners to improve completeness of the data. 
Health Disparities 
COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted many racial and ethnic groups. CDC 
continuously looks to enhance our COVID-19 outreach and mitigation efforts for communities 
identified as most at risk. For example, CDC is supporting local activities in African American, 
Hispanic/Latino, American Indian and Alaska Native, and Asian American, Pacific Islander, and 
Native Hawaiian communities to deliver COVID-19 prevention messages and community 
mitigation strategies. CDC recently released a COVID-19 Health Equity Strategy 
(www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/cdc-strategy.html) that provides 
8 
 
 
an evidence-based, comprehensive and coordinated framework for reducing COVID-19 
disparities. The Strategy includes expanded plans for collecting and reporting timely, complete, 
representative, and relevant data on testing, incidence, vaccination, and severe outcomes among 
populations at highest risk.  Additionally, CDC is working with existing program grantees, such 
as Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH), to enhance outreach to 
populations at increased risk of complications from COVID-19. These broad-based community 
engagements and strategies are working with the aim of ensuring equitable access to testing, 
health care, and future COVID-19 vaccines.  
American Indian and Alaska Native communities are some of the most affected by 
COVID-19. As of August 2020, CDC has provided $206.4 million to tribal nations, consortia, 
and organizations for responding to COVID-19 across tribal communities. This amount exceeds 
the minimum of $165 million directed by Congress through the Coronavirus Preparedness and 
Response Supplemental Appropriations Act and the CARES Act.  CDC is using a multifaceted 
approach, guided by data, to allocate COVID-19 funding to tribal communities, enabling broad 
access to COVID-19 resources through a variety of direct and indirect supports. 
Children 
We are learning more about how COVID-19 impacts children every day. Although 
children are less likely than adults to develop severe illness when infected with SARS-CoV-2, 
household studies and outbreak investigations confirm that children can transmit the virus and 
often have the same or higher viral loads in their nasopharynx compared with adults. Though the 
mortality rate is low for children aged 18 years and younger, COVID-19–associated 
hospitalization rates increased among this age group during the summer months and are 
continuing to rise. From March 1, 2020 to July 25, 2020, one in three hospitalized children was 
admitted to an intensive care unit.  
CDC is committed to providing schools, teachers, staff, parents, and caregivers with 
information and guidance to help keep our children as safe and healthy as possible as schools 
reopen.  CDC has developed enhanced guidance based on the most recent science, including 
considerations for operating schools during COVID-19, considerations for Institutions of Higher 
Education regarding the appropriate use of testing, and a school decision-making tool for 
9 
 
 
parents, guardians, and caregivers.  These resources provide students, school administrators, and 
parents the information they need to guide decision-making and how to adapt to local conditions. 
Community Mitigation and Workplace Safety 
The American people, communities, public health professionals, medical providers, 
businesses, and schools look to CDC for trusted guidance on responding to COVID-19. CDC is 
building and using a growing, data-driven evidence base to develop and disseminate guidance for 
a range of audiences, including business, schools, and healthcare professionals.  These 
recommendations include actions that every American should take, such as wearing a mask, 
following good personal hygiene practices, staying at home when sick, and practicing social 
distancing to lower the risk of disease spread.  CDC recently released Interim Guidance for 
Businesses and Employers Responding to COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in 
the workplace and protect critical infrastructure workers. CDC guidance specifies that business 
operation decisions should be based on both the level of disease transmission in the community 
and their readiness to protect the safety and health of their employees and customers.  CDC 
guidance for businesses is available here: http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-
ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html.  
Vaccine Planning 
While surveillance, testing, contact tracing, and community mitigation interventions are 
the best tools we have right now, looking to the future, CDC continues to work to prepare our 
nation’s public and private health systems to deliver a COVID-19 vaccine once it is available.  
CDC is using its expertise in public health preparedness and response, along with its 
immunization infrastructure, to support Operation Warp Speed in vaccine promotion, 
distribution, administration, and monitoring. CDC is working closely with the Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts who 
develop recommendations on the use of vaccines to control disease in the United States. ACIP 
members have expertise in areas such as vaccinology, immunology, internal medicine, family 
medicine, virology, public health, infectious diseases, and/or preventive medicine, and one 
member is a consumer representative who provides perspectives on the social and community 
aspects of vaccination. An August ACIP meeting focused on post-marketing vaccine safety 
surveillance, epidemiology of individuals at increased risk of COVID-19, and modelling 
10 
 
 
allocation strategies of the initial COVID-19 vaccine supply. Any recommendations ACIP makes 
for who should get COVID-19 vaccine and in what order will be grounded in guidance from the 
country’s foremost experts on immunization science. 
CDC is working closely with state and local health departments and community 
organizations to prepare a detailed yet flexible plan for vaccine distribution that will be informed 
by a prioritization framework recommended by ACIP.  
These efforts include working with CDC’s 64 immunization grant recipients to help 
ensure that the U.S. immunization system can mount an effective vaccine delivery program, 
including vaccine distribution and tracking. State and local health departments have conducted 
pandemic vaccination planning with immunization and preparedness funding from CDC for over 
a decade. Updating these vaccination response plans for implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine 
will build readiness for timely administration when a vaccine becomes available. During August 
2020, CDC completed in-person and virtual site visits to assess needs as vaccine planning 
intensifies. Lessons learned during these site visits will inform CDC’s provision of technical 
assistance to all jurisdictions to aid in the development of state-specific COVID-19 vaccination 
plans.  
In addition, some state and local health department’s utilized supplemental resources to 
build infrastructure that would address current COVID-19 response needs and incorporated 
planning for future phases. One example is in Chicago, where the health department has 
developed the Chi COVID Coach app to communicate directly with Chicago's residents who 
may be COVID-19 positive. The forward-thinking app, built by private sector companies, can be 
adapted throughout the course of the pandemic. It now allows users to register to receive the 
vaccine once it becomes available. 
While it remains unclear how long the pandemic will last, COVID-19 activity will likely 
continue for some time. It is also unclear what impact the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will 
have on health care and public health systems during the upcoming influenza season and beyond. 
Circulation of COVID-19 and influenza virus at the same time could place a tremendous burden 
on the health care system.  Therefore, getting a flu vaccine is especially important.  It is 
important that Americans have confidence in all vaccines. CDC will leverage its immunization 
program to help maintain high coverage in routine childhood immunizations, promote 
11 
 
 
immunization for adult vaccine-preventable diseases, and  increase coverage for flu vaccinations, 
and prepare for a potential COVID-19 vaccine. 
CDC works with public health and clinical partners each year to increase the number of 
people who get a flu vaccine and eliminate barriers to vaccination. Ongoing COVID-19 activity 
may affect where and how flu vaccines are given. On June 4, CDC awarded $140 million to 64 
jurisdictions through CDC’s existing immunization cooperative agreement to launch a scale up 
for influenza season, given the increased risk of COVID-19.  Funds are supporting staffing and 
preparedness with a focus on ensuring flu vaccine coverage for populations most at risk.  
Conclusion 
COVID-19 is the most significant public health challenge to face our nation in more than 
a century.  CDC is providing the American public with the information and assistance it needs to 
defeat COVID-19. As we work together to fight COVID-19 and end this pandemic, CDC is 
committed to its mission to protect all Americans from disease threats and to save lives, now and 
in the future.  
 
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health 
Diagnostics and Testing 
  Testing is an essential component of the public health response to SARS-CoV-2 (the 
virus that causes COVID-19). It enables clinical decision making, informs resource allocation 
and disease prevalence monitoring, and is necessary to minimize community and economic 
disruption through targeted infection prevention and control measures. The indications for viral 
testing depend on the stage of the pandemic and the extent of community spread. In general, 
testing is indicated for diagnosis of those who are symptomatic or asymptomatic, tracing of those 
in contact with those who are infected, screening of specific employees (for example nursing 
home staff), and surveillance testing of those who are asymptomatic to achieve infection control 
and/or other public health objectives. 
12 
 
 
Repeated testing of  a majority of the U.S. population is not feasible at this time, nor 
necessary to assure safe return to work, school, and other activities.  Rather,  a targeted testing 
strategy that rapidly diagnoses those who are ill, protects the vulnerable, and identifies emerging 
outbreak areas – when combined with public health mitigation measures like mask wearing, is 
proven to reduce the spread and flatten the curve.  
To date, the U.S. has accomplished over 95 million tests, at an average current rate of 
between 700,000 – 800,000 tests per day, with enough tests in the market to perform three to 
four times that amount. Since early March, we have increased our daily testing by over 30,000 
percent. In June, July, and August, states far surpassed their goals for testing. Specifically, state 
goals for June were 12.9 million tests, and nearly 16 million were actually performed. The goals 
for July were 13.7 million tests; again, states far exceeded their goals by conducting over 25 
million tests. In August the nation completed over 25.2 million tests, far exceeding the August 
goal of 21.1 million tests. Over the next several months, the nation’s testing capacity will 
continue to increase. We anticipate that supplies and reagents will be sufficient to conduct 
approximately 90 million tests in September. If pooling occurs even for a fraction of these tests, 
there is capacity to perform much greater than 100 million tests per month today.   Turnaround 
time is improving and continuing to improve. Currently, 97 percent of ACLA tests ordered in the 
previous week received results within 3 days, and 99 percent received results within 5 days. 
The role of the Federal Government is to set the overall testing strategy and requirements, 
provide technical guidance, secure the supply chain, scale scarce resources, enable innovation, 
and support state plans to achieve the overall national objectives as well as any specific state 
objectives. States, territories, and tribes are responsible for formulating and implementing testing 
plans that meet national objectives and additional goals for their state. The academic, 
commercial, and private sectors will continue to develop and produce technologies, supplies, and 
services to meet the needs of the states and the nation at large. 
The national strategy for testing was formally outlined in the Testing Blueprint: Opening 
Up America Again, and the Addendum to the Testing Blueprint.  The immediate objectives of the 
strategy are to: 
  Identify newly emergent outbreaks 
13 
 
 
  Support public health isolation and contract tracing 
  Diagnose COVID-19 rapidly in hospitalized patients 
  Protect the vulnerable 
  Support safe reopening of schools and businesses 
  Enable state testing plans 
The national strategy for testing was further enumerated in the COVID-19 Strategic Testing Plan 
Report to Congress initially submitted to Congress on May 24th.  On August 22nd, HHS 
submitted the first update to the Strategic Testing Plan. The report outlines how HHS increased 
domestic testing capacity across the United States and provides additional guidance and 
information about diagnostic technologies, platforms and inventory that states, territories and 
tribes can utilize to develop flexible, adaptable, and robust COVID-19 testing plans. 
Identifying Newly Emergent Outbreaks 
  In addition to public health surveillance systems monitored by the CDC, the nation is 
currently maintaining sufficient baseline testing for SARS-CoV2 in order to detect early changes 
in percent positivity. At present, a minimum target of testing 2% of a state’s population per 
month has been sufficient to detect early changes in percent positivity, and thus enable state and 
local officials – with the technical assistance of the federal team – to implement mitigation steps 
rapidly to curb the emerging outbreak. 
  In order to assure that states meet this 2% threshold to detect any threat of emergence in 
that state, the federal government will continue to: 
  Assist states with the procurement of collection supplies to achieve minimum of 
2% population testing per month; and if possible, provide more supplies if needed 
to meet the approved state plan targets. To date, the Federal Government has 
procured and delivered 95 million swabs and 77 million tubes of media 
  Assure sufficient supply of reagents to achieve testing goals in the context of 
point of care utilization and use of commercial referral labs; 
  Prioritize states with outbreaks or potential outbreaks, if needed, and; 
  Continue to expand the availability and use of point of care tests. 
14 
 
 
Support Public Health Isolation and Contact Tracing 
  A key function of testing is to support identification of infected individuals, many of 
whom may be asymptomatic, in communities identified with outbreaks or emerging outbreaks. 
In response to “hotspot areas”, the Federal Government has set up surge testing to increase 
baseline testing 2X-5X for short periods of time. Surge testing sites have been implemented in 
Miami, FL; Jacksonville, FL; Edinburg, TX; Uma County, AZ; Pima County, AZ; Coconino, 
AZ; Phoenix, AZ; Atlanta, GA; Birmingham, AL; Cochise County, AZ; Mohave County, AZ; 
Yavapai County, AZ; Baton Rouge, LA; New Orleans, LA; Bakersfield, CA; Houston, TX; 
Harris County, TX; Clark County, NV; and Honolulu, HI.  These 19 sites have conducted 
approximately 290,000 tests. Surge testing is a supportive adjunctive activity; it cannot substitute 
for disciplined adherence to mitigation measures including masking, hygiene, avoidance of 
indoor crowded areas and crowds, and protection of the vulnerable. These mitigation techniques, 
when combined with selective surge testing – have proven highly effective to reverse recent 
community outbreaks. 
  In order to support public health isolation and contact tracing, and to reduce turnaround 
time, the federal government has: 
  Provided massive surge testing to localities prioritized by the White House 
Coronavirus Taskforce, and agreed to by state and local officials; 
  Augmented testing, both baseline and surge, for Federally Qualified Health 
Centers (FQHCs) and retail sites, both fully federally sponsored and federally 
enabled; 
  Supported local testing efforts with surge of collection supplies and reagents;  
  Worked collaboratively to validate and promote EUAs for pooling across all 
laboratory platforms;  
  Worked collaboratively to validate and promote EUAs for new extraction 
methods to increase productivity; 
  Invested in new testing technologies that improve sensitivity, specificity, and/or 
turnaround time, including new point-of-care tests, and; 
  Providing point-of-care testing to all nursing homes in America.  
15 
 
 
Diagnose COVID-19 Rapidly in Hospitalized Patients 
  Because there are now treatments authorized for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 
including Remdesivir, convalescent plasma, and steroids, it is critical to diagnose patients as 
soon as possible. Currently, large commercial labs are prioritizing inpatient samples to ensure 
diagnosis within 24-36 hours. Our best information also suggests that the great majority of 
individual hospitals are able to meet this time frame for patients within their hospital systems. 
Protect the Vulnerable 
Older Americans, particularly those in nursing homes, are much more likely to suffer 
serious consequences including death, from COVID-19. In addition to older Americans, racial 
and ethnic minorities are also disproportionately affected.  
To ensure that specimens are collected without overburdening the traditional health care 
system, and to ensure testing in the most vulnerable communities, in mid-March, the Federal 
Government established Community-Based Testing Sites (CBTS) in CDC-prioritized locations 
across the country. The CBTS model was developed for States, local public health agencies, 
healthcare systems, and commercial partners as they work together to stop the spread of COVID-
19 in their communities, focusing initially on healthcare facility workers and first responders. 
The CBTS federally supported, state managed, locally executed model has been a profound 
success, testing approximately 400,000 individuals.  For the initial 41 sites, CBTS 1.0, the 
federal government provided a federal physician who ordered all of the COVID-19 tests, the 
federal contracts for shipping the specimens, laboratory processing, patient notification, and 
logistics (to include supplies, personal protective equipment, language translation services). The 
federal government also utilized U.S. Public Health Service personnel to provide data 
management, safety and quality control checks at each site. 
Building on the initial success of the CBTS model, the Federal Government next 
leveraged public-private partnerships with pharmacy and retail companies (CVS, Health Mart, 
Kroger, Rite Aid, Walgreens, and Walmart), also known as CBTS 2.0, to accelerate testing for 
more Americans in more communities across the country.  The public-private partnership model 
operates on the federally supported, state managed model. 
16 
 
 
As the transition of CBTS federally run sites to state-run sites has been completed, the 
federal government has broadened its community testing support to a more sustainable model -- 
specifically by continued support of retail and pharmacy partnerships in more than 800 locations 
in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, which collectively have conducted over 2 million 
tests to date. The Federal Government focused on communities with high social vulnerability 
using the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) as one of the main factors to select site 
locations. Approximately 65 percent are located in communities with moderate to high social 
vulnerability. The SVI measures the resilience of communities when confronted by external 
stressors along four main themes: socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, 
minority status, and housing type.  
This pharmacy and retail partnership provides convenient access to COVID-19 testing, 
but it is also a bridge for retailers to implement new regulatory flexibilities and expanded 
reimbursement options HHS has provided through private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. 
This partnership also leverages the newly expanded authority given to pharmacists to order and 
administer COVID-19 testing, this effort is also known as CBTS 3.0. Now, CVS and Walmart 
have over 1900 sites utilizing these new regulatory and reimbursement options with over 2 
million tests performed. 
Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) supported health centers are 
community-based and patient-directed organizations that deliver affordable, accessible, quality, 
and cost-effective primary health care to medically underserved communities and vulnerable 
populations across the United States. Nationwide, nearly 1,400 HRSA-funded health center 
grantees operate approximately 13,000 sites, providing primary and preventive care to more than 
28 million patients each year.  Over 91 percent of health center patients are individuals or 
families living at or below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines and nearly 63 percent 
are racial/ethnic minorities. Health centers are uniquely situated in communities to serve those 
that are most vulnerable and 97 percent of these centers offer COVID-19 testing.  As of 
September 4, 2020, health centers have administered 3,690,098 COVID-19 tests (including 
215,231 antibody detection tests), with over 49 percent of tests provided to racial and/or ethnic 
minority patients. Of these tests, 444,186 returned positive, with 59 percent of racial and/or 
ethnic minority patients testing positive. 
17 
 
 
To prevent further spread and deaths in nursing homes, CDC and CMS recommended 
that nursing homes perform baseline testing of all residents and staff, followed by routine testing 
of staff to reduce outbreaks, morbidity, and mortality.  CMS requires a regimen of staff testing 
based on the degree of community spread. To protect the vulnerable and to assist states in 
meeting these recommendations and requirements, on July 14, 2020, the Trump Administration 
announced that HHS would embark on a one-time procurement of rapid point-of-care testing 
instruments and tests to be distributed to nursing homes using the Defense Production Act. 
Through this aggressive action, nursing homes will be able to augment their current capacity for 
coronavirus testing, bolstering their response and helping to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. 
This will facilitate baseline testing among nursing home residents and staff, and enable a 
pathway to conduct ongoing testing according to public health guidelines. 
I am pleased to announce that all 13,850 initially eligible nursing homes have received 
one or more point of care instruments, and nearly 5 million tests.  Following this initial 
distribution, we will facilitate nursing homes being able to reorder supplies via their normal 
commercial distribution channels.   
Vulnerable populations in many underserved communities are suffering disproportionate 
health impacts resulting from COVID-19, including number of infections, hospitalizations, and 
deaths. As part of the HHS response to this crisis, on June 23, the HHS Office of Minority 
Health (OMH) announced the selection of the Morehouse School of Medicine as the awardee for 
a new $40 million initiative to fight COVID-19 in racial and ethnic minority, rural and socially 
vulnerable communities. 
Morehouse School of Medicine has entered into a cooperative agreement with OMH to 
lead the initiative to coordinate a strategic network of national, state, territorial, tribal and local 
organizations to deliver COVID-19-related information to communities hardest hit by the 
pandemic. The three-year initiative will include the development and coordination of a strategic 
and structured network of national, state, territorial, and local public and community based 
organizations that will help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on racial and ethnic minorities as 
well as rural and socially vulnerable communities across the nation. The initiative also includes a 
national multi-media outreach and education effort. One of the primary goals of these 
18 
 
 
information dissemination efforts is to provide additional education and community-level 
information on resources to help fight the pandemic to those who need it most. 
Support Safe Reopening of Schools and Businesses 
While we must be prudent to protect those most vulnerable, we must also be mindful of 
the prolonged effects that school and business closures have on millions of children and parents. 
The efforts of the Federal Government to galvanize the testing infrastructure in the United States, 
and the efforts to reduce turnaround times, have provided communities with the resources they 
need to safely reopen schools and businesses. 
Enable State Plans 
  To enable states to achieve the testing goals developed in coordination with the Federal 
government, the Federal government has worked with manufacturers to gain insight into 
diagnostic instrument install bases; procured and shipped collection supplies; and determined 
reagent inventory. The Federal Government then provided all information to states so they could 
better determine how to optimize their testing strategy. The Federal Government also purchased 
and allocated POC devices and over 2.3 million tests; developed, implemented, and facilitated 
community-based testing sites across the country; and provided significant guidance and 
technical assistance for state plans. The increase in the numbers of tests performed since early 
March is a direct reflection of these efforts. 
  States and territories have now submitted two iterations of their testing plans. These plans 
were developed in collaboration with federal multidisciplinary experts through teleconferences 
and other meetings. Plans were reviewed by a multidisciplinary federal team that included 
leadership from CDC, the Immediate Office of the Secretary, and the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary for Health.  
  The first iteration of the jurisdictional testing plans for May and June were released to the 
public on July 10, 2020, and are available for viewing here. The Federal team provided feedback 
to each state, and each state incorporated this feedback into detailed plans covering July through 
December. The state plans for July-December have been reviewed and scored and were released 
to the public on August 10, and are available for viewing here. 
19 
 
 
  To ensure states meet their testing goals, the federal government procured FDA 
authorized swabs and transport media, and is distributing these supplies to a single location in 
each state determined by the Governor’s office. Starting in May and through September 11, the 
federal government has distributed over 95 million swabs and more than 77 million tubes of 
transport media.  
Moving forward, jurisdictions should use the $10.25 billion provided to states, territories, 
and localities by the Federal government to support the purchase of tests and related supplies, 
personnel for contact tracing, and reporting infrastructure, etc., for their jurisdictions, as needed 
to fulfill their approved testing plans. 
Other Initiatives  
  In order to capture feedback and foster communication between Federal officials and the 
private sector, HHS created the National Testing Implementation Forum. The Forum brings 
together representatives from key stakeholder groups to share information and provide input to 
federal leaders about SARS-CoV-2 testing. Members of the Forum provide their perspectives on 
how HHS can best identify and address end-to-end testing supply chain issues across 
commercial, public health, academic, and other sectors and define optimal testing in various 
settings (diagnostic, screening, surveillance, others). Members also provide input to improve 
technical assistance across the nation to target testing among the vulnerable and underserved and 
create a sustainable diagnostics ecosystem that is sustainable and fully capable for future public 
health challenges.  The first Forum meeting was held on July 30th and the principle topic of 
discussion was testing supply chain. On August 13th the second meeting was held and 
surveillance and reopening strategies were discussed. The third forum, with the topic of engaging 
minority and underserved communities, was held on September 3rd.  
  On August 27th, the Administration announced that a $760 million contract was awarded 
to Abbott for the delivery of 150 million rapid BinaxNOW COVID-19 point of care tests. This 
initiative will expand strategic testing in the United States. The Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 
Ag Card, which recently received an EUA from the FDA, does not require instrumentation and 
will deliver COVID-19 test results in 15 minutes or less. This test uses nasal swabs and can be 
easily deployed in many settings across the country.

United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps 
  Since the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Corps has been an indispensable 
asset leveraged to address the public health needs of the nation in response to this crisis. The 
Corps is one of the eight uniformed services of the United States and the only uniformed service 
committed to protecting, promoting, and advancing the health and safety of the nation. Corps 
officers serve throughout the nation in communities that are most in need by providing essential 
healthcare services to underserved and vulnerable populations. 
  In January, the Corps deployed officers to provide expert outbreak response in direct 
support of CDC. Deployment expanded rapidly from 53 officers on January 24, 2020 to 4,170 
officers deployed as of September 8th, with many officers being deployed numerous times. Corps 
officers provided critical assistance to community-based testing sites throughout the nation and 
their contributions to this effort are immeasurable. In response to the escalating crisis, the Corps 
established COVID-19 Clinical Strike Teams, which include officers from the variety of 
disciplines needed on the frontlines. This kind of ready-made unit allows the Corps to deploy a 
“cavalry” to support healthcare systems under stress in states across the country. COVID-19 
Clinical Strike Teams have deployed to a long-term care facility in Kirkland, Washington, to the 
Javits Center in New York City, and to the TCF Center in Detroit. At the end of March, the 
Navajo Nation requested CDC assistance to provide care amidst a surge of COVID-19 cases. 
Since that time, the Corps has deployed teams to support the response. 
  The United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps stands ready and willing 
to respond to the public health needs of our country and to provide essential healthcare services. 
 
Assistant Secretary for Preparedness Response 
 
The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response’s (ASPR) mission is to save lives and 
protect Americans from 21st century health security threats. During previous public health 
emergencies, ASPR has led, on behalf of HHS, Emergency Support Function #8: Public Health 
and Medical Services, under the National Response Framework. This means ASPR serves as the 
21 
 
 
primary coordinator for public health information and deployment of assets to support the 
domestic health components of a response. 
 
For the current COVID-19 domestic response, ASPR funding has been used to accelerate 
development of medical countermeasures, enter into contracts to resupply personal protective 
equipment and other critical components deployed from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) 
to aid in the treatment of persons with or suspected of having COVID-19, provide grants to 
hospital associations and healthcare centers to aid in the ongoing response, and provide support 
via the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) to augment care in communities significantly 
impact by COVID-19.  
 
It is important to note that while the COVID-19 response remains the primary mission and duty 
at ASPR today, there are other existing requirements the organization has supported throughout 
2020. Throughout 2020, ASPR has assisted in the repatriation of Americans from China and 
Japan at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. We deployed personnel to Lebanon in August to 
assist with response and recovery efforts following the explosion in the Port of Beirut. ASPR 
provided temporary medical surge support in Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi after Hurricane 
Laura, and we still have National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) teams deployed to 
Louisiana to assist with recovery efforts following Tropical Storm Sally.  In addition, ASPR 
deployed personnel to California and Oregon to support search and rescue efforts for the 
wildfires. We supported these calls for action and support while simultaneously responding to 
domestic requests for assistance to aid in the COVID-19 response. . ASPR is a unique and 
nimble organization and has been able to respond to emerging needs throughout the COVID-19 
response.  
 
Medical Countermeasure Development Efforts 
Since late January, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) 
within ASPR has collaborated with counterparts across the government to identify potential 
COVID-19 medical countermeasure candidates and accelerate their development. BARDA has a 
track record of success in delivering effective countermeasures in response to public health 
emergencies. Past successes include the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, Ebola outbreaks in 
22 
 
 
2014-2016 in West Africa and in 2018 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as the 
Zika outbreak in 2015.  
 
At the onset of the pandemic, BARDA reviewed investments, modified contracts, and began 
working with Regeneron, Janssen, and Sanofi Pasteur to initiate the development of vaccines and 
therapeutics for COVID-19. All three have successfully developed both prophylactic and 
therapeutic medical countermeasures for emerging infectious diseases in the recent past.  
 
To date, utilizing the supplemental funding provided by this Committee, ASPR/BARDA is 
supporting over 50 medical countermeasure projects for COVID-19 response. All of these 
contract awards are listed on medicalcountermeasures.gov in detail and include: nine 
therapeutics, 29 diagnostics, and seven vaccine candidates. Six vaccine candidates are operating 
under Operation Warp Speed (OWS). In support of securing a safe and effective vaccine as 
quickly as possible to protect the American people and return to normal operations, we are 
making significant progress in advancing these vaccines. In fact, three – AstraZeneca, Moderna, 
and Pfizer – are in Phase 3 meaning that we are closer than ever before in having a safe and 
effective COVID-19 vaccine available to the public. The remaining three – Novavax, Sanofi 
Pasteur/GSK, and Janssen are in Phase 1/2.   
 
It is important to note that we are strictly adhering to and following all regulatory and safety 
requirements to support vaccine development. We are not sacrificing the safety of the vaccine in 
order to expedite its development. We are instead supporting two steps at the same time: vaccine 
development and vaccine manufacturing. Supporting these efforts simultaneously ensures we are 
positioned to produce and manufacture the vaccine quickly and effectively. Specifically, we are 
making investments in the necessary manufacturing capacity at Federal risk, giving companies 
confidence that they can invest aggressively in development and allowing faster manufacturing 
and potential distribution of an eventual vaccine. Specifically, the recent awards to Pfizer, 
Novavax, AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Sanofi Pasteur/GSK all include product development and 
investments in large-scale manufacturing capabilities in the contract award.  
 
23 
 
 
BARDA is also working with and reviewing the capabilities and capacity of our Centers for 
Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADMs). The CIADMs are 
government-sponsored facilities that were created as public-private partnerships to establish 
domestic manufacturing capacity and response capabilities in order to ensure the nation has 
adequate surge capacity for rapid medical countermeasure production to address pandemics or 
other biological threats. The two HHS CIADMs are Emergent BioSolutions in Baltimore, MD, 
and Texas A&M University System in College Station, TX. Currently, AstraZeneca and Janssen 
have reserved space at the Emergent facility to manufacture vaccines at scale. In addition, in 
June, BARDA reserved existing vaccine manufacturing capacity as well as expanded 
manufacturing capacity at the Texas A&M CIADMThrough OWS, manufacturing capacity at the 
Department of Defense’s (DoD) Advanced Development and Manufacturing facility, Ology 
Bioservices Inc. could also be utilized if necessary. I would be happy to keep the Committee 
updated on the progress of utilizing CIADMs as we move forward in this space. 
 
Lastly, ASPR/BARDA is supporting efforts to expand capacity for fill-finish to ensure that, once 
we have an approved vaccine, we can begin manufacturing without having to wait for ancillary 
products (e.g. (vials, needles, and syringes). Contracts include: capacity expansion for needles 
and syringes (contracts with Smiths Medical, Inc., Retractable Technologies, Inc., and Becton, 
Dickinson, and Company); capacity expansion for glass tubing and vials/cartridges (Corning 
Pharmaceutical Technologies); expansion of sterile injectable capacity (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific); establishment of manufacturing systems for durable, high-performance glass/plastic 
vials (Si02); and, general capacity expansion and reservations for fill/finish (Grand River Aseptic 
Manufacturing, Inc.).   
 
Resupply of the Strategic National Stockpile  
ASPR, through the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) maintains a national repository of large 
quantities of medical countermeasures for a variety of threats (chemical, biological, radiological, 
and nuclear (CBRN) threats as well as general public health responses) stored in strategic 
locations around the nation. While SNS assets can be deployed for CBRN incidents, the SNS is 
also poised to provide assets to support response operations to large-scale public health 
emergencies, such as those caused by hurricanes, disease outbreaks, or other natural disasters.. 
24 
 
 
Specific to the current COVID-19 response, as of August 18, 2020, and in coordination with 
interagency partners including the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland 
Security, the SNS has provided more than 18.5 thousand tons of personal protective equipment 
(PPE) and other medical material to support States to aid in medical response as well as the 
federal repatriation effort to bring American citizens back from abroad. This deployment of PPE 
encompassed approximately 90 percent of the total SNS PPE inventory available at the 
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to PPE, the SNS deployed ventilators and 
Federal Medical Stations (FMS) to support the response.   
 
To respond and prepare for COVID-19, as well as prepare for any new and emerging public 
health threat, ASPR/SNS is working to implement SNS 2.0. This initiative has three main 
objectives: 
  Ensure the SNS has the breadth and depth to meet any future pandemic or public health 
emergency;  
  Bolster the U.S. industrial base for critical pharmaceuticals and medical supplies; and,  
  Reduce America’s vulnerabilities and reliance on foreign suppliers and manufacturers.  
Under the first initiative, current planning is underway to achieve a capacity to meet 90 days of 
need by this fall, which will require a combination of actions to increase the supply of PPE and 
other critical items in the SNS, in the commercial supply chain, and at the point of use (such as 
hospitals). Since the start of the pandemic, orders have been placed for approximately 800 
million N95 respirators and face masks for delivery to the SNS. The SNS currently holds 
approximately 80 million N95 respirators and face masks within the overall stockpile. The SNS 
is currently on track to have 10 times more masks on hand by the fall of 2020 than were 
available prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the SNS has received more 
than 125,000 new ventilators from COVID-19-related contracts awarded in the spring. The SNS 
currently has more than 130,000 ventilators on hand for deployment, which is more than seven 
times the quantity held in pre-COVID-19 pandemic inventory. The SNS has also began 
procuring necessary testing supplies, including test kits, swabs, and viral transport media, to 
ensure that Americans have access to the most advanced and robust COVID-19 tests in the 
25 
 
 
world. The SNS inventory is projected to include 44 million swabs and 65.5 million viral 
transport media by the end of 2020.  
 
To support a number of these contracts, HHS has leveraged and utilized actions under the 
Defense Production Act (DPA).  Title I of the DPA allows the President, among other 
authorities, to require businesses and corporations to prioritize and accept government contracts 
for materials and services.  HHS has exercised Title I DPA authorities using the Health Resource 
Priority and Allocations System (HRPAS) in order to prioritize contract action to compel a direct 
response to the place of greatest need. A number of health resource materials have been 
identified that are essential to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, these items, like 
PPE and ventilators, are in high demand. A priority rating has at times proved necessary to 
provide the requested quantities and qualities of these health resources within a specified time 
period or delivery date. These rated orders are filled first when there are both commercial 
demands and government demands for the same product, or component(s) of a product. Utilizing 
this authority has enhanced national preparedness and is helping ensure there is product available 
if and when it is needed.   
  
Under the second initiative, ASPR/SNS is working with DoD to expand domestic manufacturing 
capacity.  The partnership between DoD and HHS, which allowed SNS to tap into DoD’s 
contracting resources and experience with industrial based expansion projects, was critical for 
the success of the U.S. Government’s efforts to expand domestic production capacity of medical 
supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using CARES Act funding, the SNS has funded a 
number of projects including: 
  Melt blown fiber (MBF) – to date the SNS has expanded the domestic manufacturing 
capacity to produce MBF, a critical component in N95 and surgical mask production. 
  Increased domestic production capacity for surgical masks – to date the SNS has 
supported contracts to allow manufacturers to stand up additional production lines and 
production centers to produce surgical masks. 
  Increased domestic production capacity for nitrile gloves – to date the supported contracts 
to increase annual domestic production capacity of nitrile gloves by 450 million starting 
July 2020, to be completed by July 2021. 
26 
 
 
  Increased domestic production capacity for testing swabs – to date the SNS has supported 
an increase domestic production capacity for swabs 
  Increased domestic production capacity for rapid point-of-care test kits – to date the SNS 
has supported an  increase in annual domestic production capacity of COVID-19 test kits 
by 8 million a month by February 2021. 
 
Lastly, to support efforts under the third initiative, ASPR is working in partnership with the HHS 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to understand and identify, as early as possible, supply 
chain issues. Much of our supplies and medical materiel come from international partners. We 
must, and will, continually evaluate and understand these dependencies to best inform 
acquisitions and planned procurements.  
 
Preparing the Nation’s Healthcare System 
ASPR’s Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) strengthens health care sector readiness to 
provide coordinated, life-saving care in the face of emergencies and disasters. As the only source 
of federal funding for health care system preparedness and response, HPP promotes a consistent 
national focus to improve patient outcomes during emergencies and disasters and enables rapid 
recovery. 
 
HPP was established after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, with the goal of improving 
the capacity of local hospitals across the country to deal with disasters and a large influx of 
patients in an emergency. Prior to COVID-19, HPP’s annual appropriation supported: the annual 
cooperative agreement program to 62 state, local, and territorial health department recipients to 
support health care coalitions; the Regional Disaster Health Response System (RDHRS); the 
National Emerging Special Pathogens Training and Education Center (NETEC); and ten 
Regional Ebola and Other Special Pathogen Treatment Centers (RESPTCs). 
 
In response to COVID-19, HPP has awarded additional funds COVID-19 supplemental funding 
to support National Special Pathogen System (NSPS), building upon many of HPP’s core 
programs and activities. Funds were distributed to support the traditional HPP recipients, the 10 
RESPTC recipients, the NETEC, and a new funding mechanism to directly support hospitals and 
27 
 
 
other health care facilities through 53 hospital associations. The NSPS supports a coordinated 
national approach to preparing for public health and medical emergencies so that the U.S. has a 
tiered, capable system that coordinates national expertise, regional capabilities, and state and 
sub-state health care capacity across the public and private sectors in order to drive an effective 
and safe pandemic response. The NSPS will continue to deploy and enhance capabilities to 
address continued surge events during the current pandemic – as well as prepare to address 
potential future special pathogens. 
 Additional supplemental funding was awarded by HPP to support efforts to secure the nation’s 
blood supply through a partnership with the American Red Cross. Through this effort, we will be 
better able to maintain blood operations, enabling hospitals and other health care entities to meet 
demand for blood and avoid shortages of this lifesaving medical resource. Lastly, HPP is also 
supporting a collaborative effort with DoD to establish a National Emergency Tele-Critical Care 
Network (NETCCN) to support expanded telehealth capabilities nationally. The NETCCN is 
comprised of a cloud-based, low-resource, stand-alone health information management system 
for the creation and coordination of flexible and extendable “virtual critical care wards.” These 
wards bring high-quality critical care capability to nearly every bedside, whether in a health care 
facility, or in an alternate care site such as a field hospital, or in a gymnasium – enabling critical 
care anywhere. 
 
 
ASPR’s Support for COVID-19 Response 
While we await a vaccine, ASPR has supported other efforts to help mitigate the transmission of 
the virus when and where possible. Beginning in March 2020, ASPR initiated the production and 
distribution of more than 500 million cloth face masks across the country. Many of these face 
masks were provided to long term care and dialysis facilities to help protect some of the most 
vulnerable in our communities. And, more recently, we are sending 125 million cloth face masks 
to states and territories for distribution to schools.  
 
28 
 
 
ASPR also works to enhance medical surge capacity by organizing, training, equipping, and 
deploying Federal public health and medical personnel, such as National Disaster Medical 
System (NDMS) teams, and providing logistical support for federal responses to public health 
emergencies. NDMS was originally created during the Cold War to take care of military 
casualties from overseas in U.S. civilian hospitals.  
 
At the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in January and February, 2020, NDMS teams were 
deployed to strategic locations across the country to care for U.S. citizens evacuated from Japan 
who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, effectively providing medical care and limiting 
the potential spread of the disease. Overall, HHS deployed over 600 Public Health Service 
Commission Corps Officers and NDMS personnel to support this repatriation effort. In addition, 
HHS provided cache equipment, (e.g., medical supplies and resources) to the repatriation sites to 
aid in the medical needs and care of returning Americans.  
 
As the response shifted and cases increased domestically, NDMS teams have been deployed, 
when requested by a state, to provide augmented care. Specifically, NDMS has supported 
hospital augmentation (such duties include: emergency room support, hospital decompression, 
setting up medical overflow centers for patients, and mortuary support). As of September 10, 
2020, ASPR has supported approximately 3200 NDMS deployments of medical, mortuary, and 
veterinarian specialists to various missions across the country to 18 different states. With the aid 
of NDMS personnel and resources, communities have been able to continue to provide care to 
those in need of medical assistance and treatment. NDMS will continue to support such requests, 
and we appreciate the funding this Committee has provided to date to support these efforts.   
  
Conclusion 
On behalf of all the witnesses, we thank you again for your support. Whether supporting 
hurricanes, floods, influenza outbreaks, and other infectious disease outbreaks such as Pandemic 
Influenza, Ebola, Zika, or the current COVID-19 pandemic, we have utilized the authorities and 
resources provided by Congress to best support the nation in responding to the threat and 
mitigating the lasting impact.

Before the   
Senate Committee on Appropriations   
Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  
  
July 21, 2020  
  
Introduction  
  
Good afternoon Chairman Graham, Vice Chairman Leahy, and other esteemed 
Members of the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
Programs.  It is a pleasure to be here with you today and I very much appreciate 
the opportunity to discuss the State Department’s role in addressing the 
increasingly important issue of marine debris.  Even during this time of incredible 
uncertainty, we continue to address this complex challenge around the world.  The 
State Department works closely with our interagency partners to leverage our 
combined resources and expertise in our global marine debris engagement.   
  
Marine debris is a global problem with global consequences.  Marine debris 
originates from mismanaged waste leaking into the environment, usually starting 
on land and then entering the ocean.  The American people see this on the coasts of 
the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans, and on the shores of lakes and rivers. 
Reliable estimates put the direct economic impact of marine debris on Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) economies (including the United States) at 
over $10 billion annually.  A component of the tourism sector is hit particularly 
hard by lost revenue from tourists who choose to spend their vacations away from 
polluted marine environments, forcing local, state, and national governments to 
spend millions of dollars cleaning beaches.  Marine debris also harms marine 
ecosystems and fishing industries through economic losses due to abandoned or 
lost fishing gear, commonly referred to as “ghost gear.” Ghost gear continues to 
capture fish and other marine life for as long as it drifts, depleting seafood stocks 
and ultimately reducing regional food security.  Floating debris also poses major 
navigational hazards for ocean-going vessels, for example by entangling ship 
drives.    
  
Though marine debris includes various materials, such as glass, metal, cloth, and 
rubber, one of the most common materials comprising marine debris is 
plastic.  Current estimates indicate that there are more than 150 million tons of 
plastic waste in the ocean with another 8 million tons added each year; that works 
out to a full garbage truck’s worth of plastic entering the ocean every minute.  By 
2050, there could be more plastic than fish (by weight) in the ocean.     
  
Plastics are a vital societal asset and tradable commodity in the global economy. 
Their durability and non-biodegradable properties that are so valuable for food 
safety and other applications, can also lead to plastic accumulation on land and in 
the marine environment when plastic waste is not managed in an environmentally 
sound manner.  Plastic can take hundreds of years to decompose naturally, if it 
decomposes at all.  In many cases, plastic degrades into smaller harmful “micro 
and nano-plastic” fragments that are impossible to retrieve, but which enter the 
food chain when consumed by sea life.  Moreover, micro and nano-plastic are 
transported across the globe, including by ocean currents and jet streams, and can 
now be found from the deepest parts of our oceans to the ice and snow of our 
highest mountains.   
  
Marine debris does not respect international boundaries and the problem cannot be 
solved by one country alone.  Combatting marine debris, including marine plastic 
litter, requires collaborative efforts from all stakeholders, public and private.  We 
welcome and actively support efforts by all U.S. stakeholders to work with 
governments and other actors globally to address this problem.   
  
Global Engagement  
  
Marine debris is a far-reaching issue that impacts environmental and food security, 
economic stability, resource management, and potentially human health.  The size 
and complexity of the challenge is immense, especially in developing economies 
that may not have the appropriate infrastructure or policy apparatus to take 
effective action.  Our international approach focuses on promoting 
environmentally sound waste management, supporting recycling and recycling 
markets, promoting sustainable materials management, encouraging innovation to 
prevent mismanaged waste from entering the environment, and supporting debris 
removal efforts.  The United States has a wide array of technology and expertise to 
assist countries in improving their waste management and recycling systems.  We 
are working closely with colleagues from the Environmental Protection Agency, 
National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy to highlight U.S. 
expertise and innovation to combat marine debris through new waste management 
technologies, materials research, and other cutting-edge solutions.  We also engage 
with countries to understand the scale and scope of the problem, supporting efforts 
to combat land and sea-based sources of marine debris, promoting government and 
stakeholder outreach to positively influence cultural and societal norms, 
encouraging a more sustainable approach to plastic use and disposal, and fostering 
dialogue to expand research into more recyclable materials and alternatives.  We 
are dedicated to supporting and highlighting the best available scientific 
information and data collection methods necessary to inform policy makers and 
private industry about the economic, environmental, and health implications of 
marine debris and identify pollution hot spots.   
The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is the biggest offender, responsible for 30% 
of waste, far more than any other country.  Our approach to the PRC is to hold it 
accountable for addressing its own waste management issues, both land-based and 
sea-based, and to do so with their own resources.  Prioritizing our efforts on 
improving waste management infrastructure and practices in other major source 
countries will yield results, but cultural norms also need to shift to effect 
permanent change and solve the longer-term issue.  Increased efforts to curb ghost 
gear, enhance cross-sectoral collaboration (e.g., connecting financial institutions 
with innovators and entrepreneurs), and promote innovation throughout product 
lifecycles will also aid in solving the marine debris and plastic pollution problem.   
  
As you know, the bipartisan Save our Seas Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-265) directed the 
State Department to take a comprehensive approach to its international 
engagement on marine debris.  The Department of State, through the Bureau of 
Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, is working with 
interagency, private sector, academic, industry, and non-governmental stakeholders 
to engage multilaterally, regionally, and bilaterally with partners around the world 
to address marine debris.     
  
The Department of State works with interagency partners in the EPA, NOAA, 
USAID, NSF, DOC, DOE, USCG, and USTR to bring together diverse 
international stakeholders and underscore the importance of global cooperation –
from the public and private sectors – to prevent and reduce marine debris.  The 
United Nations has increased its focus on marine debris in recent years as we have 
worked extensively to elevate the issue in bilateral and multilateral fora.  In June 
2012, UN Environment Programme (UNEP) launched the Global Partnership on 
Marine Litter.  Since then, nations, including the United States, have worked in 
concert to prevent and reduce marine debris worldwide, while mitigating its impact 
on economies and human and animal health.  The Department of State leads 
interagency engagement as contributing members of the UN Environment 
Program’s Ad Hoc Open-Ended Expert Group on Marine Litter and Microplastics 
where we promote the United States’ holistic vision for combatting marine debris. 
The outputs from the Expert Group will provide key inputs to policy discussions at 
the fifth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly, planned for 
February 2021.    
  
We have also advocated for solution that recognize the important role of the 
private sector as a key stakeholder that can contribute towards pragmatic 
solutions.  We continue to engage with private sector-led initiatives, including the 
Alliance to End Plastic Waste and Circulate Capital, which are mobilizing billions 
of dollars to assist countries to improve their waste management and recycling 
systems and to create a value chain for recycled plastics.    
  
We also work in the G7 and G20 fora to tackle marine debris.  In the G7, we 
promote better coordination of various country-level initiatives supporting 
additional research on microplastics and their impact on human health, improved 
scientific monitoring, and advocating for better use of resources to recover, reduce, 
recycle and repurpose waste.  In 2019 at the G20 Leaders meeting, we worked 
closely with Japan’s G20 Presidency to help develop the Osaka Blue Ocean Vision 
2050, which aims to reduce additional marine plastic litter pollution to zero by 
2050.  We also supported the development and adoption of the G20 
Implementation Framework for Actions on Marine Plastic Litter and the G20 
Resource Efficiency Dialogue aimed at increasing mutual understanding regarding 
activities and best practices on marine plastic litter.   
  
We also support working through the existing Regional Seas Programs and other 
regional initiatives to address marine debris and marine plastic litter.  The United 
States is a member of two Regional Seas Programs that engage neighboring 
countries to collaborate on preventing pollution from entering the ocean.  Through 
the Caribbean Environment Program, created in connection with the Cartagena 
Convention, we led an effort to make marine debris reduction a priority. We 
worked jointly with EPA launching an initiative in partnership with UN 
Environment Programme and the Peace Corps to develop community-based trash 
reduction projects and create effective solid waste management policies.  Projects 
in Jamaica and Panama helped those countries to advance their efforts to keep 
waste from entering the Caribbean.  
  
Our work in APEC has yielded significant public and private action.  For example, 
following the success of several workshops in meetings held in the Asia-Pacific 
region over the last several years, the Department of State and our interagency 
partners at NOAA spearheaded the establishment of a marine debris sub-fund with 
nearly a million dollars in seed funding for projects to combat land-based sources 
of marine debris in the APEC region.  The estimate of direct economic costs that I 
cited earlier – exceeding $10 billion annually in the APEC region alone – is from a 
report1 that the United States commissioned to enhance regional and global 
understanding of the true cost of the problem.  We were also successful in leading 
an interagency effort with the Republic of Korea to establish an APEC Roadmap 
on Marine Debris that now serves as the guiding document for the organization’s 
efforts.   
  
In the Pacific Islands, we provide financial and technical support under the 
Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the 
South Pacific Region, also known as the Noumea Convention.  The Department of 
State is partnering with the U.S. Coast Guard to enhance Pacific Islands’ capacity 
to combat marine pollution.  Our work has also extended to the Arctic Council, 
OECD, the IMO, the ASEAN Regional Forum, Regional Fisheries Management 
Organizations, and a wide array of other international entities now tasked with 
working to address marine debris.    
  
The United States leadership on addressing marine debris, specifically ghost gear, 
is also exemplified by our recent joining of the Global Ghost Gear Initiative (GGGI).  
GGGI is the preeminent international initiative working to address the problem of 
ghost gear and convenes a broad coalition of members, including fifteen other 
countries and 13 U.S.-based fishing and seafood companies.  While our 
membership with GGGI only became official a few weeks ago our close 
collaboration with GGGI and it's parent organization, the Ocean Conservancy, date 
back years as evident by ongoing Department of State grants in the Indo-Pacific 
and Caribbean regions. 
 
Supporting U.S. Economic Interests  
  
In international fora, the Department has seen increasing calls for stopgap solutions 
to global waste issues, including implementation of bans on single-use plastics, 
support for negotiating a legally binding international agreement on plastics, and 
the development of measures that inhibit the global market for recycled goods. 
Barriers, bans, and trade restrictions can reduce recycling by lowering the value of 
                                                      
1 Report available at: https://www.apec.org/Publications/2020/03/Update-of-2009-APEC-Report-on-Economic-
Costs-of-Marine-Debris-to-APEC-Economies 
commodities, and often do not consider negative environmental and economic 
trade-offs associated with alternative materials.  
 
Beginning in 2018, the PRC implemented its National Sword policy, banning the 
import of 24 types of solid waste and scrap material, including a variety of plastics 
and unsorted mixed papers.  The policy disrupted a number of the waste 
management and recycling streams across the United States and elsewhere that 
were previously structured for export to China.  These disruptions in the global 
movement of recycling commodities continues to reduce market prices and alter 
trade relationships and markets.  There are also concerns that the National Sword 
Policy and similar restrictions will divert waste to countries, in particular 
developing countries in Southeast Asia, with comparatively weaker waste 
management systems and high rates of waste leaking into the environment.   
More recently, in May 2019, the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention 
on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their 
Disposal amended the Convention to make most non-hazardous plastic waste and 
scrap exports subject to the prior informed consent of the importing 
country.  Beginning on January 1, 2021, the new plastic waste amendments will 
prohibit the 187 Basel parties from trading most plastic waste and scrap with the 
United States, a non-Party, except under the terms of a separate agreement or 
arrangement with us that provides for environmentally sound management.  We 
anticipate these amendments will significantly disrupt the global movement of 
plastic scrap and potentially cut off U.S. exports and imports of certain non-
hazardous plastic scrap.  
 
This challenge and the broader issue of tackling marine debris presents 
opportunities for U.S. businesses.  Plastic and other materials that are recovered can 
generally be recycled and often traded as recyclable commodities, creating sustainable 
supply chains and green jobs across a diverse set of industrial sectors if we work 
together to find the solutions.In 2018, the U.S. solid waste management and 
recycling industry generated an estimated $100 billion in revenue.  The global 
waste management market size is expected to reach $530 billion by 2025, with the 
Asia-Pacific region expected to see the highest compound annual growth rate, at 
about 6 percent during the period from 2018 to 2025.  Expanding overseas markets 
for U.S. waste management and recycling services and technologies would yield 
benefits to American companies and countries with underdeveloped waste 
management infrastructure; a win all around.  Our Embassies are vital in helping 
U.S. businesses navigate ever-changing national and local conditions, including 
market-enabling environmental policies and regulatory developments, and 
identifying potential opportunities for U.S. waste and recycling firms, and the State 
Department continues to connect U.S. businesses with our Embassies to provide 
on-the-ground advice and information.  
  
 Programmatic Efforts  
  
We are also working bilaterally with key source countries.  For example, the 
Department of State is working closely with the interagency and civil society 
partners to support the Indonesian government’s recently stated ambitious goal of 
reducing its marine litter by 70 percent by 2025.  As part of that effort, we 
sponsored a renowned American marine debris expert, Dr. Jenna Jambeck of the 
University of Georgia, as a U.S. Embassy Speaker.  With Embassy support, Dr. 
Jambeck met with students, academia, civil society, and government officials in 
South Africa, Japan, Vietnam, Philippines, China, and Indonesia.  The Department 
of State has also developed an outreach campaign called Face the Waste to provide 
educational materials on environmentally sound waste management techniques and 
technologies and highlight the expertise of agencies like EPA, USAID, the 
Department of Commerce, USTR, and NOAA.  In addition, U.S. Embassy Public 
Diplomacy sections regularly conduct outreach events to engage and educate the 
host country’s public on marine debris, as well as inform exporters of U.S. 
environmental technology and services about opportunities in foreign countries.   
    
Over the past five years, the Department of State has developed and managed over 
$5.8 million dollars in grants to combat marine debris and plastic pollution.  We 
provided a nearly one million-dollar grant to the Ocean Conservancy to aid the 
implementation of Vietnam’s National Action Plan on Marine Debris, to support 
the informal waste management sector, and advance additional research into waste 
pathways into the marine environment.  We also worked with local NGOs in 
Vietnam to reduce marine debris via social change in Ly Son Island.  The project 
established a local steering committee on environmental protection, conducted 
training with community leaders, engaged in coastal clean-ups, and trained 
households on the proper methods for waste sorting and recycling and provided 
reusable shopping bags.  We continue to support the Ocean Conservancy’s annual 
International Coastal Clean-up activities.  We regularly highlight and promote this 
event, aimed at building awareness and gathering data around the impact of marine 
debris on coastlines.  Our embassies also sponsor coastal clean-ups on Earth Day 
around the world and participate in the annual International Coastal Clean-up 
serving to highlight U.S. commitment to the issue.   
  
Our grant work has a global reach to conduct coastal clean-up activities and host 
community outreach events.  We also collaborate with industry to develop and 
implement alternative materials for fish boxes tested by the fishing industry to 
reduce polystyrene marine debris.  In Panama and Costa Rica, our NGO partner 
provided technical assistance to six coastal cities that reduced waste, trained 
municipal officers, developed local government solid waste management plans, 
and instituted a public information plan to incentivize actions that reduce marine 
debris.  To date, that campaign has reached roughly 1.9 million people.  Grants we 
implemented in Indonesia and the Philippines aim to reduce marine debris by 
building effective waste management and plastic recycling economies and reduce 
land-based leakage of plastic waste through engagement with local governments in 
over 80 cities to promote zero-waste systems and product redesign.  
  
Other grants have included work to curb the prevalence of ghost gear in Peru’s 
coastal waters by collecting and recycling end-of-life fishing gear.  This project has 
managed to collect more than 220 tons of end of life fishing nets for recycling 
annually.  In Jamaica and Grenada, another grant program incentivizes good 
fisheries management practices through an insurance product and developed 
innovative fishing gear and gear marking technologies to prevent ghost gear from 
occurring while facilitating gear recovery.  
  
Currently, the Department is developing a program to support municipalities in 
West Africa to improve environmentally sound management of plastic waste and 
encourage innovation along the plastic supply chain to reduce plastic waste leakage 
into the environment.    
  
As has already been shown, our embassies have been engaged on the issue as 
well.  Embassy Green Teams develop and support environmentally friendly 
activities ranging from promoting the use of reusable water bottles and packaging 
at the embassy to working with host country partners to reduce local waste 
generation.  For example, Embassy Bangkok worked closely with the hospitality 
industry in Phuket, Thailand to establish a successful waste reduction program in 
hotels by promoting reusable container use.  
  
We need innovation in materials and design, changes in behavior, and significant 
improvements in waste management systems to reduce the amount of marine 
debris and plastic pollution.  These solutions should also vary according to regional 
and national contexts.  For example, work by manufacturers on automated, high-
throughput sorting technologies to efficiently categorize plastic materials by 
physical and chemical characteristics is necessary for nations with well-established 
material recovery facilities. But this solution sometimes does not translate to 
developing nations where many consumers are forced to use single-use plastic 
sachets of daily goods like soap and detergent, simply because they cannot afford 
to buy larger containers.  We need different solutions to fit the local realities.  
  
With that in mind, we plan to continue efforts to work in major source countries to 
combat land-based sources of marine debris via development of improved waste 
management infrastructure, support recycling and markets for recycled material, 
encourage innovative product lifecycle design, promote debris removal, and 
promote behavior change, including through demonstration projects, workshops, 
and public awareness campaigns.  We also plan to combat sea-based sources of 
marine debris, particularly ghost gear, by promoting gear-making guidelines and 
workshops to share best practices with key target countries.  We will also support 
the contributions of our interagency partners to international scientific initiatives, 
studying the environmental and economic impact of marine debris globally 
through monitoring programs, micro- and nano-plastics research, assessments of 
land-based sources, as well as workshops and scientific exchanges with U.S. 
researchers to promote U.S. expertise, methodologies, and technologies.  
  
Conclusion  
  
These are just a few examples of the State Department’s wide-ranging international 
engagement on marine debris, working together with our interagency colleagues, 
private sector stakeholders, and international partners.  As the Save Our Seas Act 
of 2018 recognizes, addressing marine debris is impossible without close 
coordination both domestically and internationally.  American leadership is critical 
to advancing the global effort to combat marine debris by focusing on effective 
solutions that are grounded in innovation, environmentally sound waste 
management, sustainable materials management, and support for recycling and 
recycling markets.     
  
Congress has been an invaluable partner in our efforts and we greatly appreciate 
your support and interest in this critical topic. Thank you again for the opportunity 
to appear before you today and I would be pleased to answer any questions that 
you might have.

Introduction 
Chairman Blunt, Ranking Member Murray and distinguished members of this committee. 
It is an honor to appear before you today to discuss the Department of Health and Human 
Services’ Operation Warp Speed efforts and the Department’s efforts on vaccines, diagnostics, 
and therapeutics.   We are grateful for this opportunity to address how each of our agencies and 
offices are harnessing innovation to prevent, diagnose, and treat the novel coronavirus SARS-
CoV-2. 
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not 
previously been seen in humans. This new disease, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-
respiratory tract illnesses. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses.  Some cause illness in 
people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, 
coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. 
This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19.  Middle East Respiratory 
Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of 
coronaviruses that originated in animals and then spread to people. 
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is working closely with all of our 
government partners in this response. We thank Congress for supporting our efforts through the 
passage of the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020; 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security (CARES) Act; and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement 
Act. These laws have provided additional resources, authorities, and flexibility.  We thank 
Congress for your continual partnership that has allowed us to expedite this critical effort to 
respond to COVID-19.  
To accelerate the development and subsequent production of a vaccine for COVID-19, 
in mid-May, President Trump announced Operation Warp Speed (OWS). OWS aims to deliver 
up to 300 million doses of a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19 in early 2021, as part of 
a broader strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 
2 
 
vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics (collectively known as countermeasures). OWS is a 
partnership among components of HHS, including CDC, FDA, NIH, and BARDA, and the 
Department of Defense (DoD), with the aim of a unified government approach to respond to 
the pandemic. OWS engages with private firms and other federal agencies, including the 
Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
OWS coordinates with existing HHS-wide efforts, including the NIH’s Accelerating COVID-
19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) partnership, NIH’s Rapid Acceleration of 
Diagnostics (RADx) initiative, and work by BARDA and the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases (NIAID).  
 
To accelerate development while maintaining standards for safety and efficacy, OWS 
has been selecting the most promising countermeasure candidates and providing coordinated 
government support.  Protocols for the demonstration of safety and efficacy are being aligned, 
which will allow the trials to proceed more quickly, and the protocols for the trials will be 
overseen by the federal government, as opposed to traditional public-private partnerships, in 
which pharmaceutical companies decide on their own protocols. Rather than eliminating steps 
from traditional development timelines, steps will proceed simultaneously, such as starting 
manufacturing of the vaccine at industrial scale well before the demonstration of vaccine 
efficacy and safety, as happens normally. This increases the financial risk, but not the product 
risk. 
We will be working constantly with the FDA, sending a constant stream of data to their 
scientists. Once the data are complete, FDA will perform the analysis they need to determine 
safety and efficacy as quickly as possible. The FDA will pursue its regulatory work in the 
standard manner, and by keeping the lines of communication open, they can produce ongoing 
guidance to support the clinical trials for the OWS candidates, as they often do for agency 
priorities. 
To put it really simply, drug development is a series of boxes you have to check—very 
complicated boxes, but boxes nonetheless. You proceed through the different development 
phases, you need certification of your manufacturing processes, then you begin large scale 
manufacturing, and then you begin distribution. OWS requires checking each and every one of 
3 
 
those boxes just like we would for any other project, but we aren’t going one by one down the 
list. We’re aiming to check as many of them simultaneously as we can. 
 
The following testimony will detail how the NIH, BARDA and CDC are contributing to 
OWS and overall vaccine, therapeutic, and diagnostic efforts.   
 
National Institutes of Health  
NIH is the HHS agency leading the research response to COVID-19 and the novel 
coronavirus that causes the disease, SARS-CoV-2. Research to address the COVID-19 public 
health emergency is an NIH-wide effort. 
 NIH, in collaboration with the Foundation for the NIH, recently launched an innovative 
public-private partnership to speed the development of COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines.  
The ACTIV public-private partnership brings together stakeholders from across the U.S. 
government, industry, and the European Medicines Agency to develop an international strategy 
for a coordinated research response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other federal partners include 
BARDA, DoD, the Department of Veterans Affairs, CDC, and FDA. The ACTIV working 
groups are making rapid progress. For example, the Therapeutics Clinical Working Group 
developed and openly shared master protocols with agreed upon endpoints, sampling, and 
analysis for evaluating monoclonal antibody and vaccine candidates, in order to enhance trial 
efficiency.  
Developing Vaccines to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection 
A safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 will be essential to stopping the spread of 
infection, reducing rates of morbidity and mortality, and preventing future outbreaks.   
HHS NIAID is supporting development of several SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, 
including vaccines based on platform technologies that have shown promise against the 
coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS. As part of a longstanding collaboration, the NIAID 
Vaccine Research Center worked with the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., to develop a 
vaccine candidate using a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine platform expressing the SARS-
CoV-2 spike protein. On March 16, 2020, NIAID initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of this 
4 
 
experimental vaccine at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, and later 
added clinical sites at Emory University and the NIH Clinical Center. This trial was recently 
expanded to enroll older adults to better define the safety of and immune response to the vaccine 
across various age groups. On May 18, 2020, Moderna announced encouraging interim findings 
from the Phase 1 clinical trial and, on May 29, 2020, a Phase 2 clinical trial was initiated to 
further study safety and the immune response to the experimental mRNA vaccine. NIAID and 
BARDA are working with Moderna to launch a Phase 3 clinical trial as early as this month, 
pending positive results from this Phase 2 trial. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness 
Innovations funded the manufacture of the vaccine candidate for the Phase 1 trial, and BARDA 
is supporting advanced development of the candidate. 
Scientists at NIAID’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana have 
collaborated with University of Oxford researchers to develop a SARS-CoV-2 chimpanzee 
adenovirus-vectored vaccine candidate AZD1222, formerly known as ChAdOx1, now in a Phase 
3 clinical trial in the United Kingdom, supported by the University of Oxford. BARDA recently 
announced plans to support advanced development and production of AZD1222 in the U.S.  
NIAID is working with additional academic and industry partners to develop several other 
vaccine concepts. 
The rigorous clinical testing required to establish vaccine safety and efficacy means that 
it might take some time for a licensed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be available to the general public, 
but there is growing optimism that one or more of these vaccine candidates may prove safe and 
effective by late 2020 or early 2021.   
Identifying Therapeutics to Treat COVID-19 
Effective therapeutics for COVID-19 are critically needed to treat patients who have been 
infected with SARS-CoV-2. On February 21, 2020, NIAID launched a multicenter, randomized 
placebo-controlled clinical trial, the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT), to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of therapeutics for COVID-19, initially examining the antiviral drug 
remdesivir for treatment of severe COVID-19 in hospitalized adults (ACTT-1). An analysis of 
preliminary data from ACTT-1 indicated that those who received remdesivir had a 32 percent 
faster time to recovery, a median of 11 days compared with 15 days for those who received 
placebo. Additionally, the analysis found that remdesivir may benefit survival, although the 
5 
 
mortality data did not reach statistical significance. A mortality rate of 7.1 percent was observed 
for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.9 percent for placebo. These initial findings were 
published on May 22, 2020, in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Working as part of the 
ACTIV partnership, NIAID is developing and testing other novel and repurposed therapies. The 
adaptive design of this trial will enable the evaluation over time of additional promising 
therapies, such as the anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib, which has been added to the next 
iteration of the study (ACTT-2), currently underway. 
Another promising therapeutic is the use of monoclonal antibodies or mAbs. There are 21 
companies developing mAbs and a number of them have started early clinical trials. As part of 
the ACTIV partnership, and in collaboration with other NIH Institutes, NIAID plans to launch a 
study to evaluate mAbs in outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 early this month. A 
separate trial will evaluate mAbs in inpatients. NIAID also is planning separate clinical trials to 
assess hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin and mAbs for treatment of COVID-19 in 
hospitalized adults. 
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) sponsored the addition of a U.S. 
site for a Canadian Institutes for Health Research-funded trial of colchicine—an anti-
inflammatory drug commonly used to treat gout—for treating COVID-19 in the outpatient 
setting.  Additionally, NHLBI is leveraging the NIH-funded Strategies to Innovate Emergency 
Care Clinical Trials Network to study whether convalescent plasma, or blood plasma from 
individuals who have recovered from COVID-19, can help reduce the progression of COVID-19 
in patients with mild symptoms.  In the near future, NHLBI will begin a clinical trial on the use 
of anticoagulants, hoping to stem the life-threatening blood clots that COVID-19 causes in many 
patients.   
The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is leveraging the 
NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection, a compilation of every drug approved for human use by 
major regulatory agencies worldwide, and other collections of small molecules and compounds 
to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics for further investigation.  Other Institutes and 
Centers across NIH also are working concurrently with partners in academia and industry to 
pursue the development and testing of mAbs, antiviral, and anti-thrombotic drugs for potential 
treatment of COVID-19.  NIAID, NCI, NHLBI, NCATS, the National Institute of Arthritis and 
6 
 
Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and 
Stroke (NINDS) are all engaged in this critical effort. 
NIH also has convened the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel, comprised of 
representatives of NIH and five other federal agencies along with representatives of eight 
professional organizations, academic experts, and treating physicians including providers from 
high COVID-19 incidence areas. On April 21, 2020, the panel issued the first release of COVID-
19 treatment guidelines for clinicians.  The guidelines provide recommendations regarding 
specific treatments currently available and address considerations for special populations, 
including pregnant women and children.  On May 12, 2020, in response to the preliminary 
analysis of ACTT-1, the Panel updated these treatment guidelines to recommend remdesivir for 
the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with severe disease requiring supplemental 
oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The guidelines are 
updated regularly as new evidence-based information emerges, including the recent report of 
benefit of the drug dexamethasone in hospitalized patients, based on results of a randomized trial 
in the United Kingdom. 
Enhancing Diagnosis and Understanding the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 
NIH is supporting an HHS-wide effort to promote the development and 
commercialization of diagnostic tests to detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection. On April 29, 
2020, NIH announced the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative, which is 
working to identify, support, and make innovative strategies for COVID-19 testing widely 
accessible, in collaboration with FDA, CDC, and BARDA. The RADx initiative has four focused 
programs to scale-up testing and enhance access to those most in need. The RADx Tech 
initiative is leveraging the Point-of-Care Technologies Research Network established by the 
National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) to allow for the potential 
roll out of new products by fall 2020.  NIH has received over 2,000 expressions of interest and 
over 500 complete applications for RADx Tech. Innovators will be matched with technical, 
clinical, regulatory, business, and manufacturing experts to increase the odds of success. So far, 
nine companies have products in Phase 1 testing and are close to commercialization. In addition, 
NIAID is using CARES Act funds to support diverse SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic platforms 
including RT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and facilitating development of 
7 
 
sensitive, specific, and rapid diagnostic tests by providing critical SARS-CoV-2 isolates and 
reagents to the developers of tests.   
The RADx Underserved Populations (RADx-UP) initiative will augment the reach and 
power of technologies developed and enhanced through RADx by identifying and addressing 
implementation factors that present barriers to testing and follow-up in populations that need it 
the most. On June 12, 2020, NIH announced four new funding opportunities for community-
engaged projects within RADx-UP. The goal of this is to understand factors that have led to 
disproportionate burden of the pandemic on vulnerable populations so that interventions can be 
implemented to decrease these disparities.  
The National Cancer Institute is coordinating with FDA and NIAID to assess the 
sensitivity and specificity of certain SARS-CoV-2 serological tests, which can detect antibodies 
indicative of a prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. NCI and NIAID also are working to establish a 
collaborative national network to increase national capacity for high-quality serological testing 
with return-of-results to subjects. In addition, they will conduct research to increase the 
understanding and application of those results and support related clinical efforts, including 
clinical trials of convalescent serum and the creation of registries of tested subjects for sero-
protection studies. 
  NIAID, NCI, NCATS, and NIBIB also are partnering on a new study to investigate 
whether adults in the United States without a confirmed history of infection with SARS-CoV-2 
have antibodies to the virus, indicating prior infection. In addition, NIH is supporting COVID-19 
natural history studies to understand the incidence of infection in specific populations, including 
children and their household contacts, and aspects of the clinical course of infection, including 
incidents of thrombosis, strokes, heart attacks, and other sequelae of infection. Some of these 
studies will examine the quality and durability of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and 
evaluate whether unique immune responses may be associated with clinical disease trajectories; 
this information may be leveraged to develop SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics or vaccines. Natural 
history studies also will inform our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, including factors 
that may predict disease progression and help to identify individuals or groups at high risk.   
  In order to improve understanding of neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 and 
inform potential treatment strategies, NINDS is supporting development of a database that would 
8 
 
collect data on the prevalence and spectrum of neurological symptoms observed in patients with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. NHLBI and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child 
Health and Human Development are leading a trans-NIH effort, with participation from NIAID, 
to coordinate research into the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), an 
extremely serious inflammatory condition that has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection 
in children and adolescents. 
NIH continues to expand efforts to elucidate the viral biology and pathogenesis of SARS-
CoV-2 and employ this knowledge to develop the tools needed to diagnose, treat, and prevent 
disease caused by this virus. NIH is focused on developing and evaluating safe and effective 
COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, and sensitive, specific, and rapid point-of-care molecular 
diagnostic and serological tests. These efforts will improve our response to the current pandemic 
and bolster our preparedness for the next, inevitable emerging disease outbreak. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
CDC has worked for decades with its state and local partners to ensure public health 
systems are prepared with plans, trained personnel, strategic relationships and partnerships, data 
systems, and other resources needed for sustaining a successful routine immunization 
infrastructure, which will help ensure effective distribution can occur once a safe and effective 
COVID-19 vaccine is available.    
CDC is working closely with our government partners in response to this pandemic, 
including with our sister agencies at HHS. Each year through the Vaccines for Children program 
and the section 317 immunization program and in partnership with state immunization programs, 
CDC safely distributes over 80 million doses of vaccines from every vaccine manufacturer to 
approximately 40,000 public and private health providers across the country. We have strong 
networks connecting public health departments, health care providers, community groups, and 
others that can be used to efficiently reach the population. From these sites, vaccine may be 
transported in small quantities to clinical sites for immediate use, while maintaining cold chain. 
During an emergency, this proven system has the capacity leveraged to manage and distribute 
many more doses of vaccine than in a typical year.  
9 
 
For decades, CDC’s public-private partnerships have safely distributed tens of millions of 
doses of routinely recommended vaccines to thousands of provider sites each year. CDC’s 
experience shows the importance of strategic engagement across public and private components 
of the vaccine enterprise in a collaborative effort to ensure appropriate planning and coordination 
from development and manufacturing, to distribution, administration, and tracking. Early 
engagement and planning can help ensure quick and efficient bi-directional exchange of 
information, so that everything needed to administer the vaccine, including personal protective 
equipment, is available where and when it is needed. And finally, the public must be well-
informed, and misinformation must be addressed with timely, accurate, and trusted information.    
 CDC tracks and manages public vaccine inventory through its vaccine ordering system, 
allowing visibility into vaccine supply nationwide. CDC monitors vaccination coverage across 
the country providing national, regional, and local level data that can inform decision-making 
and outreach priorities. Vaccine coverage is monitored by jurisdictions through their 
Immunization Information Systems and CDC’s National Immunization Surveys. Suspected 
adverse events are captured through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and evaluated 
through the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Together these systems help streamline the inventory 
management of federal vaccine assets; monitor national, regional, state, local vaccination 
coverage to guide targeted outreach and program priorities; inform vaccine program 
modifications based on vaccine safety findings; implement outreach and program activities; 
tailor communications and provider education; and coordinate data sharing across jurisdictions. 
  Building on lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and CDC’s experience with 
routine domestic and global vaccine delivery, there are many critical components to consider in 
rapid implementation of a new vaccine during and in response to a pandemic. Many of these 
factors will be determined by the vaccine or vaccines that are licensed for use, and when and 
how much vaccine is available. Priority populations for receiving the initial supply of vaccine 
will need to be identified. This could be based on high-risk for exposure, high-risk for disease or 
other factors. In addition, critical plans will need to be developed for how the vaccine is 
allocated, distributed, and administered across the United States. These decisions have 
implications for both the public and private sectors, including who pays for the vaccine and 
administration fees, where and by whom vaccine is administered, and how to ensure equity and 
10 
 
avoid disparities in access. Monitoring supply, tracking who received vaccine, especially if more 
than one dose is needed, and assessing vaccination coverage are important. Critical to success of 
the nation’s immunization program is ensuring vaccine safety, effectiveness, and ultimately 
confidence in the nation’s immunization programs and policies.  
COVID-19 is not the only health threat in our midst. The 2020-2021 influenza (flu) 
season is fast approaching, posing a risk of serious complications, hospitalization, or death, even 
among otherwise healthy children and adults. Pediatric outpatient visits and routine childhood 
vaccination have also declined substantially in recent months, leaving children and communities 
at risk for preventable disease outbreaks. Utilization of core preventive services has been 
disrupted by COVID-19. In order to ensure adequate hospital and medical care capacity, we must 
work aggressively to increase influenza and other routine childhood immunizations.  Further, as 
we continue to fight the pandemic, it is important that Americans have confidence in all 
vaccines. CDC will leverage its immunization program to help maintain high coverage in routine 
childhood immunizations, to increase coverage for flu vaccinations, and prepare for a potential 
COVID-19 vaccine.  
 
CDC’s Immunization Program 
Vaccines are one of public health’s greatest achievements. Investments in CDC’s 
immunization program have improved the health of Americans.  The immunization of children in 
the United States has saved millions of lives, contributed to longer life expectancy, reduced 
health disparities, improved quality of life, and saved trillions of dollars in societal costs.  
Immunizations have become a routine part of how we care for our children. Coverage for many 
childhood vaccinations are at, near, or above 90 percent, and reported cases for most vaccine 
preventable diseases have decreased by 90 percent or more in the United States with the 
introduction of vaccines. Adults need vaccines too.  Every year thousands of adults in the U.S. 
become seriously ill and are hospitalized because of diseases that vaccines can help prevent.  
CDC’s immunization program plays a fundamental role in achieving national immunization 
goals and sustaining high vaccination coverage rates to prevent death and disability. The 
signature pieces of this program include the Vaccines for Children (VFC) entitlement program 
and CDC’s discretionary Section 317 Immunization Program.  
11 
 
VFC is one of the largest and most successful public-private partnerships, designed to 
ensure that eligible children do not contract vaccine-preventable diseases because of inability to 
pay.  Approximately 50% of children from birth to 18 are eligible to receive free vaccine through 
VFC as part of routine care, supporting the reintegration of vaccination and primary care. CDC 
works with its 61 awardees to distribute vaccines directly to more than 40,000 public and private 
providers enrolled in the VFC program. VFC has been instrumental to achieving high childhood 
and adolescent vaccination coverage rates and reducing disparities.  
The Section 317 Immunization Program is a national resource that will continue to fill 
critical public health needs, such as providing a safety net for adults with no health insurance and 
responding to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) and other urgent public health 
issues. The program supports the nation’s ability to maintain public health preparedness for a 
response to a vaccine-preventable emergency, such as a pandemic or biological attack. To 
implement the program, CDC works collaboratively with 64 awardees comprised of the 50 
states, six large cities including the District of Columbia, five territories, and three Pacific Freely 
Associated States.    
 CDC’s support of national, state and local programs has dramatically improved access to 
vaccination for all children and put systems in place to detect and respond to outbreaks of VPDs 
and to monitor vaccine effectiveness and safety.  However, we know from our surveys and data 
systems that COVID-19 interrupted access to routine medical services.  CDC observed notable 
declines in pediatric outpatient visits and routine childhood vaccination since March, leaving 
some children and communities at risk for preventable disease and outbreaks. Corresponding 
declines were also observed in the number of measles-containing vaccine doses administered in 
eight U.S. health care organizations serving publicly and privately insured patients. On a positive 
note, however, we have started to see recovery in vaccine ordering data.  
CDC is working with partners to catch up and restore the high levels of immunization.  
Fortunately, these efforts will provide opportunities to develop innovative systems and 
partnerships that will pave the way for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. For example, CDC is 
supporting providers in the safe administration of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic 
through development of guidance and support materials and helping to support catch-up 
vaccination for children who missed visits through the use of reminder/recall systems. CDC is 
12 
 
increasing communication efforts to remind parents, providers and partners of the importance of 
routine vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic and expanding outreach to provide 
information about the VFC program to families, especially those who may have recently lost 
insurance coverage.  CDC is also working with partners to encourage back-to-school vaccination 
activities during the summer and influenza vaccination in the fall. Continued coordinated efforts 
between health care providers and public health officials at the local, state, and federal levels will 
be needed to restore and maintain routine pediatric vaccination services during the pandemic. 
Another activity that is key to effective distribution and uptake of COVID-19 vaccine is 
ensuring people have accurate information to make decisions about getting the vaccine.  
 
Preparing for COVID-19 Vaccines 
CDC is working closely with the interagency staff to determine a path forward on critical issues 
related to a COVID-19 vaccine program through OWS. CDC stands ready to use its expertise in 
public health preparedness and response along with its immunization infrastructure to support 
OWS in vaccine promotion, distribution, administration, and monitoring. Congress’s recent 
investments through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act have allowed CDC 
to provide its immunization awardees $140 million in supplemental funding to support and 
enhance their immunization programs. This supplemental funding will be used to support 
awardee and local health department staffing, communications campaigns, pandemic 
preparedness, and mass vaccination. In addition to other COVID-19 vaccine response work, 
awardee activities will include a specific focus on enhancing influenza coverage, especially in 
historically underserved populations, and enrolling and working with additional vaccinators (e.g., 
pharmacists, mass vaccinators).  
Scientifically-based vaccine policies are a foundation of the U.S. immunization system. In 
the U.S., the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) advises the CDC Director 
on national vaccine policy for preventing infectious diseases in the civilian population. The 
immunization systems and expertise supported by CDC’s immunization program make 
substantial contributions to the evidence base that informs immunization recommendations made 
by ACIP. The ACIP makes recommendations based upon data about the burden of disease, 
13 
 
safety and efficacy of vaccines, economic analyses, including cost-effectiveness data, and 
information about other factors such as how recommendations can be implemented by the health 
care system in conjunction with other recommended vaccines.   
To prepare for potentially FDA-licensed COVID-19 vaccines, ACIP has established a 
workgroup that is evaluating safety and immunogenicity data of vaccine candidates, as well as 
the epidemiology of COVID-19 to target populations and priorities for vaccination. ACIP 
workgroups are responsible for collection, analysis, and preparation of information for 
presentation, discussion, deliberation, and vote by the ACIP in an open public forum. While the 
ACIP workgroup does not have the authority to act on behalf of the advisory committee and they 
cannot vote on ACIP vaccine recommendations, workgroups review specific topics in detail and 
clarify issues in a way that helps ACIP voting members make informed and efficient decisions, 
with the best and most current information available. ACIP meets routinely approximately three 
times per year (February, June, October), but may meet more frequently as needed. An additional 
meeting to discuss COVID-19 vaccines is already being planned for August 2020. In addition, 
under exceptional circumstances, an emergency ACIP meeting may be called without prior 
notice. If COVID-19 vaccines became available, it is expected that an emergency meeting will 
be called for the vaccine to receive consideration. 
Experience shows that, while vaccines are powerful tools, reaching every individual who 
would benefit from an immunization is not easy. For example, persistent racial and ethnic 
disparities exist among adult influenza vaccination rates with 9% and 12% lower coverage 
among black, non-Hispanics and Hispanics, respectively, as compared to the vaccination rate of 
whites1. To ensure that every American has access to the COVID-19 vaccine will require 
enhanced partnerships across sectors. This can build on and expand on existing partnerships that 
are in place for routine immunizations, and can also leverage other public health programs as 
well as the private sector. It is also important to recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has 
affected the ways people engage with the health care system, and that a successful vaccine 
program will need to incorporate various sites and approaches for vaccine administration. For

example, worksites that have served as locations for adult immunization may be less accessible 
due to increased telework, so other complementary sites such as pharmacies and innovative 
locations that work for a given community may be more important during our response to this 
pandemic. Regardless of traditional or complementary vaccine provider site, it will be critical to 
ensure that all sites are linked to data monitoring systems.  
A final public health consideration relates to the management of the vaccine itself—every 
vaccine has requirements regarding storage and handling that must be addressed in order for the 
vaccine to be effective when administered. Most vaccines require refrigeration, while others 
require being held at specific temperatures beyond the capacity of regular refrigerators. Ensuring 
that the cold chain is maintained from the point of manufacture until the time of use is a 
significant concern in any vaccination program. Improper storage can lead to vaccine being 
wasted, or more importantly, reduce its effectiveness. Careful consideration of all of these factors 
will be critical to ensuring that the investments that have been made in the development of a 
vaccine for COVID-19 achieve their intended purpose—protecting Americans from the threat of 
this novel coronavirus.    
Preparing for the 2020-2021 Influenza Season 
Unfortunately, COVID-19 is not the only public health threat we are facing. CDC is also 
working to increase vaccination coverage for the 2020-2021 flu season. This is an important 
public health goal in its own right, but also serves two important purposes related to COVID-19.  
First, increasing vaccine coverage this fall can reduce the strain on the health care system, which 
will be facing COVID-19 at the same time as seasonal influenza. Second, it is another 
opportunity to test the systems and infrastructure that will be leveraged to deliver a COVID-19 
vaccine. 
During the 2018-2019 flu season, only 49% of the US population received the flu 
vaccine. Still, flu vaccination helped to prevent 4.4. million flu illnesses, 58,000 flu-related 
hospitalizations, and 3,500 deaths. Any flu infection can carry a risk of serious complications, 
hospitalization or death, even among otherwise healthy children and adults. Increased flu 
vaccination coverage will protect more Americans from this seasonal health threat, while 
decreasing stress on the healthcare system.  
15 
 
CDC is committed to the goal of increasing flu vaccine uptake, especially in people at 
higher risk of serious flu and COVID-19 outcomes. We will continue to work with our public 
health and clinical partners to eliminate barriers to vaccination. The ongoing COVID-19 
pandemic may affect where and how vaccines are given, and we are working with health 
departments to develop contingency plans. CDC is also looking at operational considerations 
such as access to vaccine with potential need for social distancing, and prolonging vaccine 
uptake throughout the flu season. CDC is making additional influenza vaccine available to state 
health departments for uninsured adults at higher risk for morbidity and mortality.  To support 
this effort, we are enhancing communications to target audiences, including older Americans, 
persons with disabilities, people of any age with underlying health conditions, workers in long-
term care facilities, other essential workers, African Americans, and Hispanics. Understanding 
that African American and Hispanic communities have lower rates of flu vaccination and a 
higher risk for COVID complications, we will enhance our education and communication efforts 
toward these key communities. We will be assessing the impacts the pandemic may have on 
vaccination, evaluating the quality of communications with patients regarding vaccinations, and 
focusing on influenza vaccination and African American and Hispanic patients.  
We are taking many considerations into account in our efforts to expand flu vaccine 
coverage and focusing on specific efforts to address racial and ethnic disparities. Specifically, 
CDC will be working with the National Association for Community Health Centers to 
implement evidence-based strategies to increase adult vaccination coverage among underserved 
priority populations. We will be engaging in expert consultation to develop strategies for 
addressing racial and ethnic disparities in adult immunization, soliciting simultaneous individual 
expert opinion from 15 national leaders in health disparities, health equity, and social 
determinants of health.  
 On June 4, CDC awarded $140 million from the CARES Act to 64 jurisdictions through 
CDC’s existing immunization cooperative agreement to enable state health departments to 
launch an initial scale up for influenza season, given the increased risk of COVID-19. Funds will 
begin to support staffing and preparedness early this summer and focus on ensuring flu coverage 
for vulnerable populations.   
16 
 
There are many critical components to consider in implementation of a pandemic 
vaccine. Many of these factors will be determined by the availability and characteristics of 
licensed vaccines and the priority populations identified for receiving the vaccines.  Critical to 
success of the vaccine program is ensuring vaccine safety, effectiveness, and ultimately vaccine 
confidence. COVID-19 is the most significant public health challenge to face our nation in more 
than a century. CDC is building upon our existing programs to provide the American public with 
the information and assistance it needs to address COVID-19 head on, while simultaneously 
working with our state and local public health partners to maintain routine childhood 
immunization coverage and prepare for the upcoming flu season. As we continue to work 
together to fight COVID-19 and end this pandemic, CDC is committed to its mission to protect 
all Americans from disease. 
 
Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Biomedical Advanced Research and 
Development Authority  
ASPR’s Role in Response 
The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response’s (ASPR) mission is to save 
lives and protect Americans from 21st century health security threats. During previous public 
health emergencies, ASPR has led, on behalf of HHS, Emergency Support Function #8: Public 
Health and Medical Services, under the National Response Framework. This means ASPR 
serves as the primary coordinator for public health information and deployment of assets to 
support the health components of a response. 
 
For the current COVID-19 pandemic response, ASPR. funding has been used to not 
only to accelerate development of medical countermeasures under BARDA but also to deploy 
trained medical teams to augment care in communities overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases, 
enter into contracts to resupply personal protective equipment and other critical components 
deployed from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to aid in the treatment of persons with or 
suspected of having COVID-19 and provide grants to hospital associations and healthcare 
centers to aid in the ongoing response. We appreciate this Committee’s support of our efforts 
and are utilizing the provided funds to ensure communities have the tools and resources to 
17 
 
detect and treat those diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19.  
 
Vaccine Development Efforts 
Since late January, BARDA has collaborated with counterparts across the government to 
identify potential COVID-19 medical countermeasure candidates and accelerate their 
development. BARDA has a track record of success in delivering effective countermeasures in 
response to public health emergencies. Past successes include the 2009 H1N1 influenza 
pandemic, Ebola outbreaks in 2014-2016 in West Africa and in 2018 the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, as well as the Zika outbreak in 2015. For these past response operations as well as the 
current response to COVID-19, Congress has provided emergency supplemental funding to 
support the urgent need for medical countermeasure development.  
 
At the onset of the pandemic, BARDA reviewed investments, modified contracts, and 
began working with Regeneron, Janssen, and Sanofi Pasteur to initiate the development of 
vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. All three have successfully developed both 
prophylactic and therapeutic medical countermeasures for emerging infectious diseases in the 
recent past. BARDA’s early leveraging of these existing partnerships and established platforms 
may help shave months off the development timelines for medical countermeasures and has been 
made possible by flexible authorities authorized and provided by Congress as well as prior 
investment into these platforms. 
 
The BARDA portfolio now includes over 40 medical countermeasure projects including 
nine therapeutics, 26 diagnostics (12 of which have been granted Emergency Use Authorization 
by the FDA) and five vaccine candidates. Three of these five candidates are operating under 
OWS. On March 30, 2020, HHS announced $456 million in funds for Janssen’s (part of Johnson 
& Johnson) candidate vaccine, with Phase 1 clinical trials set to begin this summer. On April 16, 
2020, HHS awarded $483 million to support Moderna’s candidate vaccine, which began Phase 1 
trials on March 16 and received a fast-track designation from the FDA. Lastly, on May 21, 2020, 
HHS announced up to $1.2 billion in support for AstraZeneca’s candidate vaccine, developed in 
conjunction with the University of Oxford.

It is important to note that we are strictly adhering to and following all required 
regulatory and safety requirements required for vaccine development. We are not sacrificing the 
safety of the vaccine in order to expedite its development. We are instead supporting two steps at 
the same time. In addition to vaccine development, we are supporting manufacturing efforts to 
ensure we are positioned to produce and manufacture the vaccine quickly and effectively. 
Specifically, we are making investments in the necessary manufacturing capacity at federal risk, 
giving companies confidence that they can invest aggressively in development and allowing 
faster manufacturing and potential distribution of an eventual vaccine. Manufacturing capacity 
for selected candidates being advanced while vaccine candidates are still in development, rather 
than scaled up after approval or authorization. The May 21, April 16, and March 30, 2020, HHS 
agreements with AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Janssen/Johnson & Johnson respectively include 
product development and investments in large-scale manufacturing capabilities.   Additionally, 
the June 1, 2020, HHS task order with Emergent BioSolutions to advance domestic 
manufacturing capabilities and capacity for a potential COVID-19 vaccine, as well as 
therapeutics, worth approximately $628 million. Under the terms of the contracts for 
manufacturing capacity, reservations can be shifted as needed from one candidate vaccine to 
another more promising candidate based on the findings from clinical trials that are being 
conducted in parallel with manufacturing scale-up. OWS has also been working to address 
fill/finish capacity, to acquire needles and syringes, and to expand domestic capacity for 
manufacturing of needles, syringes, and vials. 
 
BARDA is also working with and reviewing the capabilities and capacity of our Centers 
for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADMs). The CIADMs are 
government-sponsored facilities that were created as public-private partnerships to establish 
domestic manufacturing capacity and response capabilities in order to ensure the nation has 
adequate surge capacity for rapid medical countermeasure production to address pandemics or 
other biological threats. The two HHS CIADMs are Emergent BioSolutions in Baltimore, MD, 
and Texas A&M University System in College Station, TX. Currently, AstraZeneca and Janssen 
have reserved space at the Emergent facility to manufacture vaccines at scale. In addition, 
BARDA is engaged in active discussions to reserve and expand capacity at the Texas A&M 
University System CIADM. Through OWS, manufacturing capacity at the DoD ADM, Ology 
19 
 
Bioservices Inc. could also be utilized if necessary. I would be happy to keep the Committee 
updated on the progress of utilizing CIADMs as we move forward in this space.  
 
Since its establishment in 2006, ASPR has proven its success in supporting past 
public health and medical emergencies. Whether the organization supported hurricanes, 
floods, influenza outbreaks, and other infectious diseases such as Pandemic Influenza, 
Ebola, Zika, or the current COVID-19 pandemic, we have utilized the authorities and 
resources provided by Congress to best support the nation in responding to the threat and 
mitigating the lasting impact.  BARDA has successfully established over 300 industry 
partnerships and obtained 55 FDA approvals for medical countermeasures. Further, 
BARDA has worked with its partners to develop robust platform technologies that facilitate 
rapid development and manufacturing of medical countermeasures in the face of a newly 
emerging threat.  
 
Thank you again for your support. Your partnership and support enable our mission 
accomplishment. I am confident that we can quickly develop and distribute a safe and effective 
vaccine to reduce the impact of COVID-19 to our nation.  
 
Conclusion 
HHS appreciates the support and interest of Congress in our work related to Operation 
Warp Speed and the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Considering the 
potential health, social, and economic benefits of getting a safe and effective vaccine faster, 
placing big financial bets on these vaccines is a fiscal investment for the nation. One economic 
analysis put the costs of nationwide stay-at-home orders at about $20 billion a day—to say 
nothing of the lives that are being lost that we can save with faster progress toward a vaccine. 
We’re putting billions of dollars on the line to solve a multi-trillion-dollar challenge. 
 
We look forward to partnering with Congress and working together as the country 
continues to open safely again. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today and we look 
forward to your questions

STATEMENT OF 
CHAIRMAN AJIT PAI 
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 
 
HEARING ON THE OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS 
COMMISSION SPECTRUM AUCTIONS PROGRAM, FISCAL YEAR 2021  
 
BEFORE THE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT 
U.S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
 
JUNE 16, 2020 
Chairman Kennedy, Ranking Member Coons, and members of the Financial Services and 
General Government Subcommittee, I appear before you today to discuss the FCC’s Spectrum 
Auction Program and update you on the work of the Federal Communications Commission.  
When I last appeared before you on March 10, I testified on the Commission’s Fiscal 
Year 2021 budget request, as well as the status of our strategic goals and programmatic 
initiatives.  Immediately following that hearing, our country was disrupted drastically as a result 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing the Commission to adapt both as a workplace and as the 
independent regulatory agency tasked with regulating our nation’s communications sector.  The 
Commission shifted to agency-wide voluntary telework two days after the hearing and 
progressed to mandatory telework soon thereafter.  To their credit, our staff did not skip a beat.   
And with respect to our mission, I’m committed to using, and we are in fact deploying, 
every resource at the FCC’s disposal to deal with this unprecedented national emergency. 
For example, I challenged broadband and telephone service providers to take the Keep 
Americans Connected Pledge—a voluntary commitment (1) not to terminate service to any 
residential or small business customers because of their inability to pay their bills due to the 
disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic; (2) to waive any late fees that any residential or 
small business customers may incur because of their economic circumstances related to the 
coronavirus pandemic; and (3) to open a company’s Wi-Fi hotspots to any American who needs 
them.  I’m proud of the fact that over 780 broadband and telephone service providers across the 
country, including all of our nation’s largest providers, have taken the Pledge and thus agreed to 
take these concrete steps to help Americans stay connected.  Many of these same companies 
have gone above and beyond the Pledge and taken additional steps to maintain or expand 
connectivity during the pandemic.  For example, companies have increased broadband speeds at 
no cost, offered free service to low-income households or students previously without 
broadband, partnered with schools and other companies to create remote learning plans, and 
enhanced telehealth opportunities.  While the initial Keep Americans Connected Pledge lasted 
for 60 days, I asked industry to step up and extend the Pledge through June 30, 2020.  And I’m 
very pleased that we now have more broadband providers signed up for the Pledge than we did 
during the initial 60 days.   
I also want to thank this Subcommittee and Congress for helping to establish the COVID-
19 Telehealth Program as part of the CARES Act.  Funding for this program supports the daily 
work of frontline healthcare providers in hard-hit regions, from New York to Navajo Nation.  By 
promoting connected healthcare services, we are enabling many more people to access care 
remotely while reducing the risks for patients and healthcare providers.  Since its passage, the 
Commission established the rules for the program in just days and has now approved funding for 
305 healthcare providers in 42 states plus Washington, D.C. for a total of $104.98 million in 
funding commitments.  In Louisiana, for example, we have awarded funding to the Ochsner 
Clinic Foundation in New Orleans, the University of Louisiana-Lafayette in Lafayette, and 
Access Health in Kenner.  In Delaware, we’ve directed funding to Christiana Care Health 
Services in Newark.  In addition, those providers with approved applications include: 
Community Counseling Services in Malvern, Arkansas; Northwestern Memorial HealthCare in 
Chicago, and the Southern Illinois Hospital Services in Carbondale, Illinois; the Central Kansas 
Mental Health Center, in Salina, and Compass Behavioral Health, in Garden City, Kansas; Johns 
Hopkins Health Systems in Baltimore, and the Anne Arundel Medical Center in Annapolis, 
Maryland; Duncan Regional Hospital in Duncan, Oklahoma; and Lincoln County Primary Care 
Center in Hamlin, West Virginia.  Our dedicated staff is continuing to process applications 
quickly and carefully to award funding to eligible applicants for eligible services and devices as 
soon as possible. 
The Commission has also taken a number of other steps to help meet connectivity needs 
during the pandemic.  For example, the Commission unanimously adopted my February proposal 
to fully fund all eligible Rural Health Care Program services for the current funding year with an 
additional $42.19 million in funding.  We took additional action to assist program participants, 
including extending the application window until June 30, 2020, and easing competitive bidding 
requirements for health care providers with expiring evergreen contracts.  And we’ve waived our 
gift rules governing the program to enable service providers to offer, and hospitals and rural 
healthcare providers to solicit and accept, improved connections or additional equipment for 
telemedicine for free during the coronavirus outbreak.  The Commission’s action will help 
ensure that rural healthcare providers have the resources and flexibility they need to promote 
telehealth solutions for their patients. 
Going beyond telehealth, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Commission has 
waived its Lifeline rules to ensure that existing Lifeline subscribers are not involuntarily 
removed from the program.  We have streamlined the enrollment process for low-income 
consumers in rural Tribal lands.  We have eased documentation requirements to make it easier 
for Americans who have recently lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic to enroll in the 
Lifeline program.  We’ve clarified that schools and libraries that are closed due to the COVID-19 
outbreak are permitted to allow the general public to use E-Rate-supported Wi-Fi networks while 
on the school’s campus or library property.  We’ve given certain high-cost carriers flexibility to 
focus federal monies on hard-hit areas allowing them to respond to the unprecedented challenges 
posed by COVID-19, and we’ve provided regulatory flexibility to hundreds of rural broadband 
and telephone providers to immediately waive consumer fees.  And we’ve granted temporary 
waivers to Telecommunications Relay Service providers to allow more American Sign Language 
interpreters to work from home in order to maintain relay services during this national 
emergency for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. 
Our pandemic emergency work has included substantial work to expand spectrum access.  
We quickly granted Special Temporary Authority to AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and 
Verizon to use additional spectrum to meet customer demand for mobile broadband across the 
United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The Commission has granted 
2 
 
similar requests to the Navajo Nation and Makah Tribe to use unassigned spectrum in the 2.5 
GHz band to provide wireless broadband service over their reservations as part of the emergency 
COVID-19 pandemic response.  And in March, we granted many small wireless Internet service 
providers temporary access to use the lower 45 megahertz of the 5.9 GHz band to serve 
customers in mostly rural and suburban communities in need of better connectivity.  To date, we 
have granted authority to more than 100 such providers, and we have heard that the spectrum is 
helping address the increased demand for broadband associated with the pandemic. 
In addition to all of this work, the Commission has continued its ongoing efforts to close 
the digital divide and implement our 5G FAST Plan.  Just last week, the Commission finalized 
the procedures for our Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase I auction, which will make $16 
billion available over ten years for the deployment of high-speed broadband to millions of rural 
homes and small businesses that are currently unserved.  For example, the preliminary list of 
eligible areas includes 215,793 locations in Arkansas, 201,075 locations in Illinois, 182,628 
locations in Louisiana, 141,792 locations in Oklahoma, and 128,086 locations in West Virginia.  
We’ve scheduled that auction to begin on October 29. 
We have also made significant progress on the Commission’s 5G FAST Plan.  In April, 
the Commission took a bold step to increase the supply of unlicensed spectrum:  We opened up 
the entire 6 GHz band for unlicensed use—a massive 1,200 megahertz test bed for innovators 
and innovation.  By doing this, we effectively increased the amount of mid-band spectrum 
available for Wi-Fi by almost a factor of five, which will be a huge benefit to consumers and 
innovators across the nation, while also protecting incumbent users of this spectrum from 
harmful interference. 
In May, the Commission modernized the rules of the 900 MHz band to help critical 
infrastructure entities develop and deploy mission-critical broadband services.  This new use of 
low-band spectrum will help us meet the communications needs of industries that provide crucial 
services, like power, to the American public. 
In June, the Commission started a proceeding aimed at revitalizing the 70, 80, and 90 
GHz bands and expanding their use for new services.  Putting this long underused, high-band 
spectrum to use could create new opportunities for reliable 5G backhaul to ferry data from the 
edge of the network to its core.  And opening up these bands for broadband service to known, 
movable locations could help keep travelers connected by creating a more technologically 
advanced and competitive market for air and sea connectivity. 
Our robust auctions program also continues apace.  Just before I last appeared before you, 
we had concluded Auction 103, where bidders won licenses for 3,400 megahertz of spectrum in 
the upper 37, 39 and 47 GHz bands.  That auction had followed on the aggressive schedule the 
year before, where we auctioned 850 megahertz in the 28 GHz band and 700 megahertz in the 24 
GHz band.  All told, these three auctions made available almost five gigahertz of high-band 
spectrum for commercial use.  To put that in perspective, that is more spectrum than was used 
for terrestrial mobile broadband by all wireless service providers in the United States combined 
before these auctions started.  Gross proceeds for these three auctions totaled over $10 billion.  
Coming up next is our 3.5 GHz auction, scheduled to start on July 23.  It will make 
available 70 megahertz of spectrum for Priority Access Licenses on a county-by-county basis, 
offering the greatest number of licenses—over 22,000—ever in a single FCC auction.  Last 
3 
 
week, our auctions staff announced that we had received 348 short-form applications to 
participate in the auction, which (again) is more than in any single auction before. 
Next on deck is the Rural Tribal Priority Window of the 2.5 GHz auction, which is 
scheduled to close August 3.  As you may recall, the Commission last year liberalized the rules 
of this underused mid-band spectrum and created a special opportunity, a filing window, for rural 
Tribes to get early access to 2.5 GHz before the commencement of an auction.  Our staff has 
been engaged in reaching out to Tribal stakeholders about this opportunity for the better part of a 
year now, and I am pleased with their efforts to assist Tribes in applying for this resource despite 
the onset of the pandemic.  Once the window closes, I expect we will move forward with 
scheduling a 2.5 GHz auction in the first half of 2021. 
After that, we’re on track to commence an auction of 280 megahertz of mid-band 
spectrum from 3.7-3.98 GHz (known as the C-band) beginning December 8.  Our efforts to make 
this critical spectrum available for 5G have been going very well.  In particular, our staff 
announced earlier this month that all eligible space station operators currently using this 
spectrum had committed to an accelerated relocation—which means it will become available for 
5G two to four years earlier than otherwise would have been the case.  Getting this essential 
spectrum out years ahead of schedule will promote American leadership in 5G, faster and more 
reliable wireless broadband connectivity for consumers, and the creation of millions of jobs, 
billions of dollars in investment, and stronger economic growth. 
In the coming weeks, the Commission will receive and release information that will be 
critical for both bidders in the C-band auction and incumbents that are responsible for the 
transition.  Space station operators must file their transition plans with the agency by June 19, 
and the public will have an opportunity to provide feedback on those plans so that incumbents 
may submit final transition plans by August 14.  In the meantime, Commission staff will adopt a 
cost catalog that will outline the presumptively reasonable costs for various elements of the 
transition and will decide the one-time payment offered to incumbent earth stations that elect to 
transition themselves.  Additionally, we expect the selection committee of outside stakeholders 
to choose an entity to serve as the Relocation Payment Clearinghouse by July 30, 2020, and 
Commission staff will review that selection to confirm that it is consistent with our rules. 
But even with all this progress, the Commission needs your help.  For example, since our 
last hearing, Congress passed the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act, which 
ratifies the Commission’s proposal to require small, rural telecommunications companies to end 
their reliance on manufacturers that pose national security threats.  I strongly support the rip-and-
replace requirements that Congress mandated, but that mandate came without money.  Last 
November, we estimated that a full-scale rip-and-replace program could cost up to $2 billion—
and we ordered an information collection to nail down those costs for all covered carriers.  As 
our staff work through the data that’s been collected, we want to work with you to appropriate 
the money needed so that we can move forward quickly to implement this program and protect 
our nation’s networks from national security threats. 
In a similar vein, Congress recently passed the Broadband DATA Act, which ratifies the 
Commission’s decision last year to require new, granular broadband deployment maps for both 
fixed and mobile providers.  But that law prohibited us from relying on the Universal Service 
Administrative Company to implement that effort—even though we repeatedly warned Congress 
that this provision would disrupt our work on improving these maps and prevent us from 
4 
 
implementing the new maps without a separate appropriation to cover the significant costs of 
developing the new maps.  As such, the Commission stands ready and willing to implement this 
measure, but we do not have the $65 million we need to get that effort off the ground and 
implement that law through its first year.  We want to work with you to appropriate this funding 
as soon as possible so that we can move forward quickly to improve our nation’s broadband 
maps.  Otherwise, this well-intentioned law will end up significantly delaying rather than 
expediting the production of better broadband maps. 
Finally, given that this hearing is about oversight of our auctions program, I should note 
that there is one auction currently mandated by federal law that we are not looking forward to 
holding.  Specifically, the Spectrum Act mandates that we auction off parts of the T-band—
spectrum from 470-512 MHz, which is currently used by public safety entities in several states.  
Our highly skilled economists believe this auction will raise less revenue than the amount needed 
to clear incumbents from the spectrum.  But because of the statutory mandate, our staff has 
nonetheless had to divert resources to preparing for an auction process to commence in February.  
Bipartisan legislation in Congress would repeal this mandate and address related concerns like 
911 fee diversion, and I hope this legislation passes as soon as possible. 
Chairman Kennedy, Ranking Member Coons, Members of the Subcommittee, I stand 
ready to work with you in the weeks and months ahead to ensure that the Commission has the 
resources necessary to achieve our critical objectives during this challenging time for our nation.  
And I look forward to answering your questions this morning.

For release only by the  
Senate Committee 
on Appropriations 
 
Statement by 
 Sonny Perdue 
Secretary of Agriculture 
Before the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies 
Committee on Appropriations 
 
March 12, 2020 
 
Mr. Chairman and distinguished Members of this Subcommittee, it is a privilege to appear 
before you today to provide an overview of the Department’s proposed budget for fiscal year 
(FY) 2021. Joining me today are Robert Johansson, the USDA’s Chief Economist, and Erica 
Navarro, USDA’s Budget Officer.  
Since we last met, USDA has worked diligently to implement the 2018 Farm Bill. 
Among our milestones, I committed to you last year we would offer the Dairy Margin Coverage 
(DMC) Program, a significant new risk management tool, in June of 2019, and we followed 
through. Implementation of conservation programs by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the 
Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is on track as well, including FSA’s 54th 
Conservation Reserve Program general sign-up, which opened in December – another 
commitment kept. We established the U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program in advance of 
the 2020 planting season and adapted several existing programs to this promising commodity not 
widely cultivated since 1937.  
USDA has continued to work toward becoming the most effective, most efficient, and 
most customer-focused Department in the Federal government. USDA worked to create rural 
economic opportunities and improve the quality of life for rural Americans. Rural Development 
invested in new and improved high-speed e-Connectivity and electricity for 7 million residents 
and improved water and wastewater infrastructure for nearly 3 million rural customers. USDA 
also launched an initiative to provide comprehensive and timely support to veterans interested in 
opportunities in agriculture, agribusiness, and in rural America.  
USDA made strides to reduce trade barriers and ensure farmers, ranchers, and food 
manufacturers and workers can fairly compete against anyone in overseas markets. Examples of 
1 
 
our accomplishments include securing full access for beef to Argentina and Japan, restoring 
market access for poultry and poultry products to China, improving access for wheat to Brazil, 
and guaranteeing rice access to the Korean market. In our effort to promote U.S. products around 
the world, USDA led six trade missions that enabled more than 170 U.S. companies and 
organizations to engage in 3,200 one-on-one meetings with foreign buyers. Our trade missions 
and 22 endorsed trade shows generated nearly $3 billion in projected export sales, while our 
export financing programs supported another $2 billion in exports in 2019. President Donald 
Trump, meanwhile, laid the foundation for a stronger farm economy through trade 
accomplishments like the Phase 1 Deal with China, USMCA, and trade agreement with Japan, 
which USDA will look to build upon in 2020. 
 
As we served out our motto to “Do Right and Feed Everyone,” USDA finalized a rule 
that will encourage more American to enter, re-enter, and remain in the workforce, helping 
individuals and families start on a path to a better life,  The Trump Administration has produced 
the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, with an unemployment rate of 3.6% over 6 
million job openings. All individuals deserve the dignity of work and the lasting transformation 
it provides to achieve their own American dream. Congress asked us in the 2018 Farm Bill to 
focus on case management and promote the long-term success and self-sufficiency of SNAP 
recipients and just last week, we introduced a proposed rule that will strengthen the way states 
serve our customers through Employment and Training programs. We believe that human 
connection, not just a monthly SNAP benefit, has the power to change people’s lives. 
 
USDA plowed ahead with IT modernization initiatives to improve customer experience. 
Customers can now discover our national treasures on Recreation.gov or save time and 
paperwork associated with disaster assistance, farm programs, and H2A applications on 
Farmers.gov, all using our interactive tools in the palm of their hand. USDA also developed 
dashboards across eight Mission Areas and seven administrative functions, which provide 
employees with sophisticated data analytics to improve internal decision-making and maximize 
the impact of customer-facing programs. USDA will continue innovating across the enterprise to 
achieve faster, easier, and friendlier programs, with a special focus on areas of greatest potential 
impact on customer service, like expanded payment options for farm programs, automated AGI 
2 
 
threshold compliance, and digital acreage reporting. In addition to supporting our customers 
digitally, USDA has also taken steps to ensure that our offices are staffed with employees that 
have the expertise that our farmers, ranchers, and rural residents need.  I know Members who 
serve on this Committee and beyond share my goal to ensure USDA is adequately staffed to 
deliver efficient and effective service for our farmers, ranchers and rural communities. Even as 
USDA strives for innovation, automation, and business process re-engineering – customers will 
always count most on our people. For the fifth consecutive year, attrition at USDA outpaced 
hiring in Fiscal Year 2019. Our agencies hired 5,002 permanent employees, while 6,954 
employees left USDA, most of whom were field based. Already in Fiscal Year 2020, USDA 
faces a deficit of hiring to attrition of nearly 600 employees. The pace of attrition places an 
extraordinary demand on a federal hiring process that is encumbered with hundreds of pages of 
requirements that frustrate qualified candidates and hiring managers alike. To help overcome this 
mounting challenge, USDA was granted temporary direct hire authority from the Office of 
Personnel Management for field and front-line positions in FSA, NRCS, Forest Service, Rural 
Development (RD), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Agricultural Marketing Service 
(AMS), National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and the Economic Research Service 
(ERS). We are holding continued discussions within the Administration on solutions to address 
this challenge. We look forward to communicating with Congress further when those discussions 
are completed.   
2021 President’s Budget 
The President’s Budget recognizes the overriding need to reduce the Federal deficit, and 
USDA shares in the responsibility of controlling Federal spending. There are proposals in the 
budget for USDA that will produce real savings in both mandatory and discretionary spending. 
The Budget includes proposals to cut programs that achieved their goals or do not work, 
eliminate wasteful or duplicative spending, streamline government operations, and limit spending 
to achieve deficit reduction goals. The President’s 2021 Budget lays out a vision for a Federal 
government that is efficient, effective, and accountable. 
USDA’s total budget authority request pending before this Subcommittee proposes a total 
of $146.1 billion in 2021, compared to $147.1 billion in 2020. The discretionary appropriation 
request for this Subcommittee is $18.1 billion, which is lower than the $21.7 billion under the 
2020 enacted levels. 
3 
 
For 2021, we will continue to prioritize customer service every day for our customers – 
the American taxpayers. We will strive to conduct the people’s business efficiently, effectively, 
and with the utmost integrity. We will promote the ability of America’s agricultural sector to 
produce and sell the food and fiber that feeds and clothes the world and to reap the earned reward 
of their labor. By promoting American agricultural products, we will work to remove obstacles 
and give farmers, ranchers, foresters, and producers every opportunity to prosper and thrive. 
Through our programs and working closely with our customers, we will facilitate rural prosperity 
through the expansion of rural business opportunities and improved infrastructure. We will also 
work to preserve the land. USDA will continue to ensure that all Americans have access to a safe 
and secure food supply. 
Become the Best Managed Department in the Federal Government 
   As USDA continues to proficiently deliver our programs, the FY 2021 President’s 
Budget supports new and continuing investments in IT modernization to improve customer 
service and streamline and modernize rural and farm program and service delivery. In addition, 
the Budget continues support for the business functions of the FPAC Mission Area by 
streamlining service delivery between FSA, NRCS, and RMA to improve efficiency, 
effectiveness, and accountability. To maximize the effectiveness of these customer-focused 
improvements, the Department must modernize its own back-office technology capabilities. The 
Budget includes an increase of $31.5 million to begin the transition to a modernized enterprise 
network in FY 2021.   
In the National Capital Region (NCR), the Department is proceeding with the 
OneNeighborhood initiative to better utilize office space in the Washington, DC Headquarters 
Complex. The Budget requests $153 million for the initiative to increase the occupancy capacity 
through life and health safety upgrades; space reconfigurations; and the replacement of outdated 
building systems. The efforts will allow the Department to reduce its lease costs in the NCR that 
amount to approximately $40 million annually.  
USDA is implementing the Continuous Diagnostics Mitigation program as required by 
the Department of Homeland Security. The Budget includes $49 million to enhance 
cybersecurity capabilities for safety and security of government data and the network. The 
Budget provides $8.5 million to develop and implement a budget spending and execution system 
that integrates with the financial system to allow the Department better stewardship of resources. 
4 
 
Additionally, $2.5 million will support the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 
2018 and enterprise risk management development to provide an organizational view of risks 
and allow the Department to gauge which risk are directly aligned to achieving strategic goals 
and objectives resulting in the highest probability of impacting USDA’s mission. 
Create Conditions so Agricultural Operations Can Prosper, Fulfilling Their Mission to 
Feed, Fuel, and Clothe the World 
Over the past year, USDA responded to circumstances that tested the resilience of 
American farmers with initiatives to facilitate economic conditions in which they can prosper. 
With the help of crop insurance, natural disaster assistance programs, and short-term trade 
mitigation programs, many producers are managing the stresses of these difficult times and are 
indicating increased optimism, particularly with expectations that trade partnerships will 
strengthen in the near future. As we implement the 2018 Farm Bill we will work toward 
achieving the primary goal of farm programs: to help farmers and ranchers manage risks and 
continue producing food, fiber, and fuel in good years as well as bad. The Budget provides $4.6 
billion for commodity program payments to maintain an effective farm safety net. Commodity 
programs are critical components of the farm safety net, serving to provide risk management and 
financial tools to farmers and ranchers. Approximately 1.7 million farms are enrolled in the 
Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC) programs, which are helping 
cushion the financial strain felt by producers due to continued low prices for many commodities. 
In addition to mandatory funding provided by the 2018 Farm Bill, the President’s Budget 
provides resources to help agricultural operations fulfill their mission to feed, fuel, and clothe the 
world. The Budget provides $8.8 billion for the Federal crop insurance program, enough to 
provide crop insurance coverage for more than $100 billion in crop value. Crop insurance 
provides farmers and ranchers a means to effectively manage their risk through difficult periods. 
The Budget includes $79 million to fully support the estimated $8.9 billion demand for farm 
loans that provide access to credit to about 35,000 farmers and ranchers to finance operating 
expenses, refinance debt or acquire a farm. It provides $1.036 billion for the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service to protect agriculture from pests and diseases, address sanitary 
(animal) and phytosanitary (plant) trade concerns, and enforce animal care legislation. For 
agricultural research and extension activities, the Budget includes a total of $3.3 billion, 
including $600 million for competitive grants through the Agriculture and Food Research 
5 
 
Initiative. The Budget includes a total of $135 million for the National Bio and Agro-Defense 
Facility (NBAF) including operational and maintenance activities and funding to transition and 
expand the Agricultural Research Service and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
research and diagnostic programs at NBAF.  
Expand Foreign Markets and Promote U.S. Products Around the World 
USDA is committed to helping U.S. farmers and ranchers identify and access new export 
markets and expanding trade opportunities. It is critical that USDA work with the American food 
and agriculture community to ensure farmers, ranchers, and food manufacturers and workers can 
fairly compete against anyone in overseas markets. To support this mission, the Budget includes 
$200 million to reduce trade barriers that disadvantage U.S. agricultural exports and to open new 
markets for U.S. farm products. Within this amount, funding is also requested to preserve or 
expand trade valued at $8 billion through resolution of foreign market access issues. To facilitate 
exports to buyers in countries that may not have access to adequate commercial credit, the 
Budget includes a program level of $5.5 billion for CCC Export Guarantee Programs to provide 
guarantees.  
Facilitate Rural Prosperity and Economic Development 
When rural Americans have increased access to infrastructure services, rural 
communities can make even greater economic contributions with healthy families and 
prosperous businesses. Economic and social science research informs decision-makers on current 
trends in rural America and gaps in existing markets, which USDA then uses to meet the needs 
of rural American businesses and citizens. USDA leverages funds and stimulates public-private 
partnerships to build rural infrastructure including: broadband, community facilities, healthcare 
services and facilities, and safe and affordable housing to help underserved communities become 
thriving communities. 
In addition to $690 million in program level for the telecommunication infrastructure 
program which supports communities with population of under 5,000, the Budget provides $250 
million in budget authority to support broadband loans, grants and loan/grant combinations that 
will provide high speed broadband services to communities with population under 20,000. It also 
provides $30 million in budget authority for broadband grants to rural Americans who currently 
do not receive any broadband service. 
6 
 
The President’s Budget supports $5.5 billion in loans for rural electric improvements, 
benefiting over 5 million rural residents annually by expanding the use of smart grid 
technologies and other security and resiliency improvements. The Budget requests $1.3 billion in 
direct loans and $614 million in grants to improve and expand the water and waste disposal 
facilities in rural America. The Budget supports $2.5 billion in Community Facilities Direct 
Loans and $500 million in Community Facilities Guaranteed Loans for investment in critical 
community infrastructure, such as healthcare, safety, and educational facilities. The Budget also 
provides $24 billion for the Single-Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program to enable 
approximately 160,000 families to enjoy homeownership and $230 million in multi-family 
guaranteed loans to support the development of more than 8,000 units for very low-, low-, and 
moderate-income rural residents. The Budget supports $1.5 billion in program level in business 
and industry loan guarantees, which is expected to assist 433 businesses support nearly 11,000 
jobs and diversify the rural economy. 
Providing additional biofuels infrastructure across rural America will help improve the 
distribution of higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel and increase the domestic consumption of 
agricultural commodities. In support of this initiative, the Budget includes $100 million to 
support grants and incentives to promote domestic ethanol and biodiesel infrastructure and 
consumption.  
Provide All Americans Access to a Safe, Nutritious, and Secure Food Supply 
USDA’s nutrition assistance programs help ensure food security by providing access to a 
nutritious diet with an emphasis on those individuals facing need due to unemployment, 
recession, disaster, age, or disability. These programs also work to promote well-being by 
providing assistance to help ensure access to a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans. The Budget includes mandatory funds to support estimated participation levels under 
current law, including $68.3 billion for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), 
$25 billion for Child Nutrition Programs, and $5.5 billion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Participation in these nutrition assistance 
programs is expected to continue declining with sustained economic growth that enables families 
to work toward self-sufficiency. The Budget includes nearly $1.1 billion to fully fund the costs 
necessary to support over 8,700 FSIS personnel who ensure the safety of the Nation’s meat, 
poultry, and egg products at over 6,400 processing, slaughter, and import establishments.  The 
7 
 
U.S. has one of the safest food supplies on the planet. Over the last decade, USDA has 
modernized inspection systems to align with 21st century technology and to prevent the hazards 
that we cannot see — the invisible pathogens and microbes that cause foodborne illness. USDA 
is committed to using the best science and technology available to protect the American food 
supply and ensure the safety of meat, poultry, and processed egg products. 
 
Program Reforms 
The 2021 President’s Budget includes legislative proposals to reform programs to gain 
efficiencies, while contributing to deficit reduction efforts. This includes several legislative 
proposals that were included in the FY 2020 Budget to better target commodity conservation 
assistance and crop insurance that would generate savings of $42.1 billion over ten years 
compared to current baseline spending.  In addition, the Budget proposes to delink the Section 32 
program from customs receipts and replace the receipt funding with direct mandatory 
appropriations. This proposal funds all of the current Section 32 nutrition programs and provides 
stable funding for surplus commodity donations. The Budget’s proposals will ensure stable 
historical levels of funding for all the nutrition programs that have traditionally benefited from 
these activities while also increasing transparency, improving operational efficiency, generating 
savings of $5.1 billion over 10 years.   
The Budget also supports a foundational principle that those who need assistance have 
access to wholesome and healthy foods. The Budget includes an approach to nutrition assistance 
that combines the use of traditional SNAP Electronic Benefit Transfer cards with a USDA 
Harvest Box that contains 100-percent American grown products. States would have the ability 
to provide choice to their recipients, including innovative approaches for the inclusion of fresh 
products. The Budget also includes proposals to reserve benefits for those most in need, promote 
efficiency in State operations, and strengthen program integrity. The Budget includes SNAP 
proposals that have the potential to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse by limiting opportunities for 
benefits to be misused or trafficked, along with funding for improved Federal monitoring and 
oversight and enhanced data matching. Combined, these reforms to nutrition assistance programs 
maintain the Administration’s commitment to ensuring Americans in need of assistance have 
access to a nutritious diet while reducing the cost to taxpayers by approximately $182 billion 
over 10 years.

Conclusion 
In the face of a growing national debt, the President has offered a fiscally responsible 
budget that no longer puts off the tough decisions to future generations. At USDA, we will do 
our part to improve customer service while reducing our economic and regulatory impact. Before 
I conclude, I want to thank our dedicated employees, without whom our service to rural America 
would not be possible. In 2019, we asked more of our people than perhaps at any other point: 
implementation of a new Farm Bill, execution of two Support Packages for Farmers, 
implementation of a supplemental disaster assistance program and its subsequent revisions, all in 
addition to their normal operations. It is a privilege to lead OneUSDA, while we strive to “Do 
Right and Feed Everyone.”  
Thank you for the opportunity to testify this morning. I would be happy to answer any 
questions at this time.

DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY  
ARMY CIVIL WORKS 
 
COMPLETE STATEMENT OF 
 
R.D. JAMES 
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE ARMY FOR CIVIL WORKS  
AND 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL TODD T. SEMONITE 
COMMANDING GENERAL 
BEFORE 
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT 
UNITED STATES SENATE 
ON 
THE FISCAL YEAR 2021 BUDGET 
FOR THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, CIVIL WORKS 
 
MARCH 11, 2020 
   
1 
 
   
     
Mister Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: 
 
I am R.D. James, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works and I am honored to 
testify before your committee today along with LTG Todd Semonite, the Commanding 
General of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, on the President’s Fiscal Year 
2021 (FY 2021) Budget for the U. S. Army Civil Works Program. 
 
Thank you for allowing us the time to address the committee. 
 
The Army Civil Works Program is the Nation’s largest water resources program and has 
three main missions: flood risk managment, commercial navigation, and aquatic 
ecosystem restoration.  The water resources infrastructure the Army has constructed 
has contributed to the Nation by helping communities reduce their flood risk, facilitating 
commercial navigation, and contributing to the restoration of several significant aquatic 
ecosystems. 
 
A key priority for the Administration is encouraging stronger partnerships between the 
Federal Government and non-federal stakeholders.  Non-federal stakeholders are an 
integral part of the process from project development to the day-to-day operations of 
completed projects.  Stronger partnerships will help leverage a broader range of 
financial resources for infrastructure investment, encourage more non-federal 
leadership, and remove barriers that can impede the ability of non-federal parties to 
move forward on their own with investments in the water resources infrastructure 
projects they deem priorities. 
 
SUMMARY OF FY 2021 BUDGET 
 
The FY 2021 Civil Works Budget is a performance-based budget, focused on reducing 
flood risk in communities across the Nation, facilitating commercial navigation, and 
restoring aquatic ecosystems.  The Budget uses a targeted approach to investing in 
water resources projects based on their economic, environmental, and safety return to 
the Nation. 
 
The Budget focuses on high-performing projects and programs within the three main 
Civil Works missions and includes $5.966 billion in discretionary funding for Civil Works 
activities throughout the Nation. 
 
INVESTIGATIONS 
 
The FY 2021 Budget provides a total of $108.345 million for the Investigations program, 
including $102.6 million in the Investigations account, and $5.7 million in the Mississippi 
River and Tributaries account to evaluate and design projects within the three main Civil 
Works mission areas and for related work, including research and development.  The 
Budget includes $31.4 million for Dam Safety Modification studies and design. The 
Investigations account also includes $25 million for Corps efforts, in conjunction with 
state floodplain management authorities, to provide technical and planning assistance 
2 
 
   
     
to enable local communities to reduce their flood risk, with emphasis on non-structural 
approaches.  The Budget continues to invest in the development of interagency teams 
known as Silver Jackets, which work with the states to enable local communities to 
understand their flood risks and to identify options to help them manage those risks, 
with emphasis on non-structural solutions. 
 
The Investigations account includes funding to complete 16 studies and five 
preconstruction engineering and design efforts. 
 
CONSTRUCTION 
 
The Budget provides a total of $2.265 billion for the construction program, consisting of 
$2.173 billion in the Construction account, $45.3 million in the Mississippi River and 
Tributaries account, and $47.1 million in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund account 
and funds seven projects to completion. 
 
The Budget also funds two new, innovative programs in the Construction account to 
improve project delivery and increase cost savings: 
 
  $250 million for the Innovative Funding Partnerships program, which would be used 
in conjunction with funds voluntarily provided by non-Federal interests in excess of 
the non-Federal sponsor’s statutory cost share to accelerate the completion of 
construction of authorized projects; and 
 
  $250 million for the Section 1043 of the Water Resources Reform Development Act 
of 2014 Non-Federal Construction of Federal Projects program, under which the 
Army would transfer appropriated funds to non-federal sponsors to construct 
projects on their own thereby accelerating projects and creating efficiencies.  The 
Budget also proposes to extend this program’s authorization. 
 
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE 
 
The Army today is focused on the maintenance, repair, and replacement of the key 
features of our water resources infrastructure, and on the repair of the aquatic 
ecosystems that Army projects have adversely affected.  The overall budget for the civil 
works program is primarily devoted to these systems so that they can continue to 
provide economic and environmental benefits to the Nation, and to address significant 
risks to safety. 
 
With proper maintenance and periodic rehabilitation, we can extend for many years the 
effective lifetime of most, if not all, of the key features of the water resources 
infrastructure the Army Corps of Engineers owns or operates.  As stewards of a large 
portfolio of projects, we are working to sustain the benefits these key features of our 
infrastructure provide. 
 
3 
 
   
     
The Army continues to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation and 
maintenance (O&M) of its large portfolio of water resources development projects.  The 
Budget focuses on investments that address infrastructure maintenance needs on a 
risk-informed basis.  It invests in the highest priority needs among the infrastructure the 
Army owns and operates, and in work that will reduce long-term O&M costs. 
 
The Budget provides a total of $3.123 billion for the operation and maintenance 
program, consisting of $1.996 billion in the O&M account, $158.8 million in the 
Mississippi River and Tributaries account, and $967.9 million in the Harbor Maintenance 
account.  The allocation of funding for maintenance among projects reflects a risk-
informed assessment that considers both project component conditions as well as the 
consequences in the event of a failure. 
 
Generally, O&M supports completed works owned or operated by the Army, including 
the operation and maintenance of the locks and dams of the inland waterways; and of 
multi-purpose dams and reservoirs for flood risk management, hydropower, recreation, 
and related purposes.  The O&M program also includes funding for dredging of coastal 
and inland Federal channels; maintenance and repair of Corps-owned facilities; 
monitoring of completed projects; and general management of Corps lands associated 
with its projects including work to serve as a responsible steward of the natural 
resources on those lands. 
 
Typically, the concerns that lead to dam safety modifications and interim risk reduction 
measures first become apparent through the inspections and monitoring that the O&M 
account funds.  Additional measures are considered and evaluated as new and existing 
issues are identified. 
 
 OTHER BUDGET REFORMS 
 
The Budget reproposes revisions to appropriations language for the Construction, 
Operation and Maintenance, and Mississippi River and Tributaries accounts; and 
includes appropriations language for the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund account and 
the Inland Waterways Trust Fund account. This language would provide greater 
transparency to the public in how these funds are spent, including the users that pay 
fees to finance some of the Trust Funds costs.  It is also needed to improve 
accountability, and ensure appropriations are being used for the purposes for which 
Congress intended.  Specifically, the proposal would make trust fund amounts definite 
and executed out of the trust funds rather than transferring them to the expenditure 
accounts for execution.  Doing so will simply clarify the accounting for expenditure of 
funds from each account. 
 
The Budget also proposes to establish an inland waterways user fee to help finance 
anticipated capital investments on the inland waterways and 10 percent of the cost of 
operating and maintaining them to support the transportation of goods.  The current 
diesel fuel tax is insufficient to support the users’ share of these costs. 
 
4 
 
   
     
The Budget proposes to divest the Washington Aqueduct, which is the only local water 
supply system in the Nation owned and operated by the Corps.  Divesting the aqueduct 
would encourage a more efficient allocation of economic resources and mitigate risk to 
taxpayers. 
 
In addition, the Budget proposes to return responsibility for management of the 
Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) back to the Department of 
Energy.  The Army Corps would continue to perform cleanup of FUSRAP sites on a 
reimbursable basis with DOE.  Consolidation of FUSRAP with the other DOE federal 
cleanup programs under a single agency will allow DOE to consider a broader range of 
federal cleanup responsibilities in prioritizing work each fiscal year and result in 
efficiencies for taxpayers. 
 
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND RESPONSE 
 
The FY 2021 Budget provides $77 million in funding for the Flood Control and Coastal 
Emergencies account, including $50 million  for emergency response work on future 
flood-related major disasters declared pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief 
and Emergency Act.  The remainder of the funds requested, $27 million, is for 
preparedness and training of Corps staff, so that they will continue to be able to respond 
to floods, hurricanes, and other natural disasters.  The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund 
also includes an additional $50 million for emergency response work (primarily 
dredging) following future flood related major disasters declared pursuant to the Robert 
T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Act. 
 
CONCLUSION  
 
The FY 2021 Budget represents a continuing, fiscally prudent investment in the Nation’s 
water resources infrastructure and the restoration of its aquatic ecosystems.  The Army 
Civil Works Program is committed to a performance-based program, based on 
innovative, resilient, and sustainable risk-informed solutions. 
 
Thank you, Mister Chairman and Members of Subcommittee.  This concludes my 
statement.  I look forward to answering any questions you or other Members of the 
Subcommittee may have.

U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Benjamin S. Carson, Sr. 
Testimony before Senate Committee on Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, 
and Related Agencies 
March 11, 2020 
 
Chairman Collins, Ranking Member Reed, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you 
for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the President’s proposed Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2021 Budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
 
This funding plan seeks $47.9 billion, an increase of 8.6 percent over last year’s request. It 
supports funding increases to programs essential to carrying out our Department’s mission. 
 
Our proposed Budget seeks an increase in funding to house and provide support services 
to our homeless. Like last year, our Budget also seeks a record amount of funding to make 
homes safer by reducing lead-based paint and other home health hazards. And, our Budget 
will continue providing critical resources and support for the more than 4.6 million low-
income families  HUD is currently serving through the Department’s rental assistance 
programs. 
 
In short, our Budget will support HUD’s combined efforts to provide safe, decent, and 
affordable housing for the American people, while being good stewards of taxpayer dollars. 
 
I would like to touch upon each of these areas individually. 
 
Ending Homelessness 
 
We are requesting $2.8 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants (HAG), which are key to 
addressing homelessness nationwide. These grants represent a 6.7 percent increase over last 
year’s funding request and will allow HUD to serve vulnerable individuals and families 
who are homeless or at risk of homelessness through prevention programs, emergency 
sheltering, rapid re-housing, transitional housing, and permanent supportive housing. 
 
The Administration also plans to begin a new initiative to reduce unsheltered homelessness. 
This  would  support  comprehensive  and  coordinated  interventions  to  reduce  street 
homelessness. 
 
1 
 
 
Our ongoing efforts are demonstrating results, as we see homeless rates of veterans and 
families on the decline. Our recent 2019 “Point-in-Time” homeless data showed that nearly 
800 more homeless veterans were housed between 2018 and 2019, continuing a nationwide 
decline in veteran homelessness by nearly 50 percent over the past decade. 
 
This progress has prompted 78 communities across 33 different states to declare an effective 
end  to  veteran  homelessness  in  their  areas.  Three  states  –  Connecticut,  Virginia,  and 
Delaware – have also declared an effective end to veteran homelessness altogether, which 
means more veterans are off the streets and have a safe place to call home. 
 
However, we still have a great deal of progress to make. California alone has 27 percent of 
our nations’ homeless population with more than 151,200 homeless individuals and is 
where half of all unsheltered Americans reside. Not only does California have the largest 
increase in homelessness of any state, but were it not for this increase, homelessness would 
have decreased nationwide. Clearly, there is a serious problem there that deserves our 
attention. 
 
Healthy Homes 
 
Our Budget includes a request of $425 million for reducing hazards in the home; this 
includes $360 million for the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes, and $65 
million for lead safety initiatives in programs administered by the Office of Public and 
Indian Housing. This request, which is $90 million higher than the funding enacted last year, 
will help achieve one of my signature goals for the year ahead: the reduction of hazards in 
the home, including lead-based paint, lead water pipes, carbon monoxide, and radon. 
 
Lead-based paint in housing presents one of the largest threats to the health, safety and 
future productivity of America’s children, with over 22 million homes (34 percent of the 
homes built before 1978) having significant lead-based paint hazards. Our Budget requests 
$240  million  in  funding  for  the  Lead  Based  Paint  Hazard  Reduction  Grants  and 
Demonstration programs, which is $5 million more than the enacted level last year. The 
grants funded through this program would make over 20,000 unassisted low-income older 
homes free of lead-based paint hazards over the life of the program. 
 
Our Budget also requests funding for lead safety initiatives in the Public Housing Fund, 
including $35 million for grants to remove lead-based paint hazards from public housing. 
To address lead water pipes, our Budget proposes $30 million for replacement of lead 
service  lines  to  Public  Housing  properties  where  the  local  public  water  system  is 
undertaking a comprehensive water main replacement program. 
 
In addition to lead, our Budget requests funding to reduce other hazards in the home, 
including $45 million for Healthy Homes Grants and Support, $35 million for installing  
carbon monoxide detectors, $5 million for radon testing and mitigation, and $30 million for 
conducting the Housing Choice Voucher Lead Risk Assessment Demonstration Program. 
2 
 
 
 
As a doctor myself, it pained me to send a young child home from the hospital when I knew 
they were not returning to a healthy home. This undeniable link between health and 
housing has been a driving force in our ongoing effort to overhaul the home inspection 
process the Department has been using for more than 20 years. 
 
This  past  year,  HUD’s  Office  of  Public  and  Indian  Housing  performed  a  wholesale 
reexamination of the Real Estate Assessment Center’s (REAC) inspection process, after 
hearing many complaints from the families living in public housing and other HUD-assisted 
units. 
 
As a result, HUD is phasing in a 14-day inspection notice policy, down from the old 120-day 
notice policy. Four months – a quarter of a year – is too long to wait for a home inspection 
to certify a unit is up to code. This shortened time period still allows property managers and 
public housing authorities enough time to ensure they have staffing in place to facilitate an 
inspection, while also assuring the inspection results more accurately reflect the housing 
conditions and operations. 
 
We continue to pursue every possible way to remove environmental hazards from housing, 
because this is, in fact, a life and death issue. Ultimately, HUD’s goal is not just healthy 
homes; it is healthy people living inside healthy homes. 
 
Rental Assistance 
 
Across our rental assistance programs, HUD has requested funding to ensure all currently 
served households continue to receive assistance, without any evictions. 
 
Our Budget continues support for the more than 4.6 million HUD-assisted households by 
requesting $41.3 billion for rental assistance. This request will allow HUD to support the 
same number of assisted households through our primary housing programs, including our 
tenant-based,  project-based  rental  assistance,  and  public  housing  programs.  It  is 
increasingly clear, however, that the way we subsidize rental housing in this country is 
broken. In fact, the way we calculate a family’s rent has not changed since President Reagan 
was in office. Our Budget proposes reforms to HUD’s current rent structure, including 
incorporating the Administration’s uniform work requirements. These reforms  would: 
require work for those who are able to work; reduce the administrative burden for housing 
authorities and residents alike; and allow greater flexibility to create local solutions to local 
challenges. HUD looks forward to working with Congress to enact the Administration’s 
proposed rent reforms to ensure these programs are sustainable for the future. 
 
Our Budget requests $13.7 billion for rental assistance programs managed by the Office of 
Housing, including Housing for the Elderly (Section 202) and Housing for Persons with 
Disabilities (Section 811). This funding level supports the same number of households 
3 
 
 
currently assisted and includes a proposed $180 million to construct approximately 1,000 
units of housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities. 
 
Our Budget requests $853 million for the Section 202 program, which is $60 million more 
than the enacted level for FY2020. The Section 202 program helps more than 124,000 elderly 
households pay their rent. Our Budget will fully fund contract renewals and amendments 
of existing Project Rental Assistance Contracts and Senior Preservation Rental Assistance 
Contracts.  In  addition,  we  are  requesting  $100  million  for  Capital  Advances  to  build 
approximately 600 units of new affordable housing for seniors. 
 
In addition, the Budget includes $252 million for the Section 811 program, which is $50 
million more than the enacted level for FY2020. The Section 811 program helps more than 
32,000 persons with disabilities pay rent. This Budget fully funds the annual renewals and 
amendments for existing units and includes $80 million for Capital Advances to build 
approximately 400 units of new housing for persons with disabilities. 
 
While we are here to talk about our Budget request, I would like to point out that not every 
challenge can simply be solved with more financial resources. One of my priorities as 
Secretary is to work with our federal, state, local and Tribal partners on identifying and 
eliminating regulatory barriers that unnecessarily increase the cost of America’s housing 
supply. Not only do these barriers increase costs for consumers, they also place a higher 
burden on taxpayers who are asked to shoulder increased costs. 
 
To encourage the growth of new homes, last summer, President Trump established the 
White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing. This 
Council, which I also have the privilege to chair, is working with local and state leaders to 
identify  and  remove  regulatory  barriers  that  artificially  limit  housing  supply  in  their 
jurisdictions. 
 
Federal Housing Administration and Ginnie Mae 
 
Since its creation during the Great Depression, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) 
has been instrumental in supporting homeownership in this country. Our Budget requests 
$400 billion in single-family loan guarantee authority, as well as $130 million for FHA 
administrative contract expenses. In addition, consistent with HUD’s Housing Finance 
Reform Plan, the Budget requests $20 million to continue modernizing FHA’s outdated 
single-family information technology systems and includes legislative proposals that would 
strengthen the viability of reverse mortgages, improve FHA’s lender enforcement program, 
and protect taxpayers. 
 
FHA’s most recent annual report stated that  at the end of FY 2019, the FHA Mutual 
Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund Capital Ratio was 4.84 percent. This represents its highest 
level since FY 2007. MMI Capital/Economic Net Worth for FY 2019 was at $62.38 billion, an 
increase of $27.52 billion from the previous fiscal year. 
4 
 
 
 
To facilitate HUD’s progress, the FY 2021 Budget proposes $30 billion in loan guarantee 
authority for FHA’s General and Special Risk Insurance programs, including programs that 
insure financing for multifamily housing and healthcare facilities. And, we propose $550 
billion in loan guarantee authority for Ginnie Mae to continue supporting the secondary 
market for federally-insured loans. 
 
Fair Housing 
 
To support HUD’s fair housing mission, our Budget proposes $65.3 million to continue 
fighting housing discrimination, increase awareness of peoples’ rights, and fund a wide 
range of services related to equality and fair housing. This request is $3 million more than 
the amount requested in last year’s Budget. 
 
Notably, our Budget requests $39.6 million for HUD’s Fair Housing Initiatives Program, 
which  will  provide  support  for  fair  housing  enforcement  activities  conducted  by 
approximately 98 private fair-housing organizations. 
 
HUD is also addressing fair housing concerns through regulatory reform. For example, last 
year, HUD issued a new proposed Disparate Impact rule designed to provide plaintiffs with 
a roadmap for pleading stronger cases, while empowering defendants to assert effective 
challenges to frivolous lawsuits. Ultimately, this new rule will bring HUD into compliance 
with the 2015 Supreme Court decision that placed important guardrails on the use of this 
legal theory. 
 
In addition, HUD recently unveiled our improved Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing 
(AFFH) rule, which is aimed at increasing affordable housing options for families and 
empowering  localities  to  pursue  policies  that  meet  their  unique  housing  needs.  This 
updated rule simplifies compliance, promotes local solutions, and focuses on encouraging 
what  everyone  needs  more  of:  lower  cost,  affordable  housing  that  is  free  from 
discrimination. 
 
Self-Sufficiency 
 
Our Budget bolsters HUD’s efforts to break the cycle of poverty by requesting $190 million 
for self-sufficiency programs. These funds directly support key initiatives like our Family 
Self-Sufficiency Program, which has over 70,000 active households and had more than 5,400 
graduates last year who are employed and do not require Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families; 41 percent of those who graduated left the program with savings in their escrow 
accounts, which had an average balance of approximately $6,700. Our Budget requests $90 
million for Family Self-Sufficiency, a $10 million increase above the FY2020 enacted level. 
 
Our  Budget  supports  HUD’s  Jobs-Plus  Program,  which  is  geared  toward  increasing 
employment  opportunities  and  earnings  of  public  housing  residents  through  a  three-
5 
 
 
pronged approach of employment services, rent-based work incentives, and community 
support. Through Jobs-Plus, nearly 1,500 individuals have been continuously employed for 
at least 180 days after placement, and residents have saved over $21.3 million in rent 
payments. Our Budget requests $100 million for Jobs-Plus, an $85 million increase above the 
FY2020 enacted level. 
 
In addition to allocated funds, HUD’s efforts to foster self-sufficiency have been greatly 
enhanced by the bipartisan support of the Opportunity Zone initiative. Opportunity Zones 
were  created  to  spur  greater  private  sector  investment  into  economically  distressed 
communities through powerful tax incentives. There are more than 8,700 Opportunity 
Zones across the country, creating a new pathway to prosperity and impacting nearly 35 
million Americans, including 2.4 million HUD-assisted individuals. 
 
To maximize the impact of this initiative, in December 2018, President Trump established 
the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, which I have the privilege to 
chair. In February 2020, the Council released its annual report, which details 180 actions 
federal agencies have taken over the past year to maximize the impact of Opportunity 
Zones.  The  actions  span  a  wide  range  of  grant  preference  points,  updated  loan 
qualifications, reduced application fees, and improved eligibility criteria for funding and 
incentives. 
 
Through Opportunity Zones, we are fostering partnerships between people who have never 
sat at the same table before: community leaders, business leaders, faith-based leaders, public 
housing  advocates,  investors,  builders,  state  officials,  and  federal  officials.  The 
conversations I’ve been a part of have been groundbreaking, and the progress we are 
starting to see is promising. 
 
Disaster Recovery 
 
HUD plays an important role in long-term disaster recovery efforts across the country, 
providing assistance for disaster survivors strengthening mortgage relief for homeowners, 
and partnering with public housing agencies to address emergency safety and security 
improvements. 
 
Since 2005, Congress has appropriated over $80 billion in Community Development Block 
Grant – Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds to the Department, with more than $40 billion 
of that appropriated in the last three years alone. 
 
While CDBG-DR funding is intended for long-term recovery needs, the unpredictable and 
overlapping nature of the program does not allow grantees to responsibly plan or act 
quickly. A re-examination of the CDBG-DR program, its role in disaster recovery, and its 
impact on Federal disaster spending is past due. 
 
6 
 
 
To that end, our Budget discusses the need to comprehensively reform disaster recovery 
programs across all federal agencies. Our intent is to set the stage for future reforms by 
beginning  a  conversation  regarding  the  current  inadequacies  of  the  program  (e.g., 
unsustainable spending, proliferation in the number and complexity of Federal programs 
that adds to interagency coordination challenges, misalignment of incentives, distortion of 
risk,  and  misalignment  of  expertise).  We  look  forward  to  working  with  Congress  on 
potential legislative changes to the CDBG-DR program. 
 
Eliminating/Reducing Ineffective Programs 
 
The Administration continues to propose eliminating the Community Development Block 
Grant program, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, the Housing Trust Fund, the 
Choice  Neighborhoods  Initiative,  and  the  Self-Help  and  Assisted  Homeownership 
Opportunity Program. In today’s budget environment, these activities are best undertaken 
by state and local governments. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Our  Budget  advances  the  Administration’s  key  priorities  by  providing  shelter  to  the 
homeless and making homes safe from health hazards. It ensures that the people HUD 
serves continue to receive rental assistance. And it does this while recognizing that difficult 
budget choices need to be made to prevent future generations from inheriting a mountain 
of debt. 
 
I’m proud of the tireless work being done by HUD’s nearly 7,500 employees, who are 
serving every community in this great nation each and every day. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to present next fiscal year’s Budget and update you on the 
progress being made at HUD.

Letter   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Chairman Hyde-Smith, Ranking Member Murphy, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss GAO’s fiscal year 
 
(FY) 2021 budget request. I greatly appreciate the subcommittee’s 
  support of our efforts to serve the Congress and improve government 
performance, accountability, and transparency. With this support, GAO 
  has identified over $1.16 trillion dollars in financial benefits and more than 
24,750 program and operational benefits since 2000. In FY 2019, GAO’s 
 
work yielded a record $214.7 billion in financial benefits, a return of about 
  $338 for every dollar invested in GAO. We also identified 1,418 other 
benefits that led to improved services to the American people, enhanced 
  public safety, and strengthened programs and operations across the 
government. 
 
 
For FY 2021, GAO is requesting $706 million in appropriated funds, an 
Fiscal Year 2021 
increase of $76 million compared with the FY 2020 enacted level, and 
Request 
authority to use $31.3 million in offsetting receipts and reimbursements. 
These resources will support 3,250 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions. 
The additional FTE will primarily bolster the Science, Technology 
Assessment, and Analytics (STAA) team and bring on additional 
appropriations law attorneys. The funding requested will also support 
priority investments in our information technology and building 
infrastructure, security requirements, as well as address long deferred 
needs. As reported in our FY 2019 financial statements, GAO’s backlog 
of deferred maintenance on its 69 years old Headquarters Building had 
grown to over $80 million as of fiscal year end. 
 
This level of funding will enable GAO to meet the highest priority needs of 
the Congress and support Congressional oversight across the wide array 
of government programs and operations. The activities planned for FY 
2021 will better position GAO to assist the Congress in meeting its 
legislative and oversight responsibilities, accomplish our mission 
objectives and goals, and improve government performance and 
accountability.

Assessing Evolving  The conference report accompanying the 2019 Legislative Branch 
Science and Technology  Appropriations encouraged GAO to reorganize its technology and science 
function by creating a new, more prominent office within GAO and provide 
Issues 
a detailed plan and timeline for establishing the new office. 
 
In response, in January 2019, GAO established the Science, Technology 
Assessment, and Analytics (STAA) team as part of a reorganization to 
enhance our ability to provide Congress with thorough and balanced 
analysis of technological and scientific developments. In March 2019, we 
submitted our plan to this Subcommittee describing the revised 
organizational structure within GAO for this team; plans for the team’s 
staffing, resources, and areas of expertise; and the products and services 
this team will provide to Congress. Over the last year, we have continued 
to build the team’s staff and its capabilities, recently hiring 26 new staff, 
with plans to hire 20 more in FY 2020. Currently, we have 80 staff in the 
team, our goal is to grow to 100 by FY 2020 year end. 
 
In October 2019, the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) 
issued its report, also required by the conference report that found that 
Congress needs to bolster its ability to obtain and use information 
regarding emerging technology. Among NAPA’s recommendations was 
that GAO continue to expand its production of technical assessments and 
short-to-medium term studies on emerging technology issues. 
 
Additionally, in report language accompanying the Further Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2020, Congress encouraged GAO to dedicate a 
specific number of experts to work exclusively on science, technology 
assessment, and analytics issues. Consistent with Congress’ desire for 
GAO to provide greater assistance in the science and technology realm, 
in this budget we are requesting additional funding to complete the March 
2019 plan for staffing and information technology tools to support 
Congress in this area. 
 
Demonstrated ability to provide science and technology analyses. 
GAO provides a variety of science and technology products and services 
to Congress, growing its science and technology portfolio by adding 
technology assessments, engineering/project controls best practices 
guides, and most recently, our Science & Tech Spotlight series. 
  Page 3  GAO-20-430T 
 
STAA’s current staff level is about one-half of what was outlined in the 
2019 Plan, so we will continue to grow our current science and 
technology workforce over the next few years. Under this request, we 
plan to grow STAA to 140 full-time equivalent total staff as we adapt to 
meet future congressional demand. We will continually assess optimum 
staffing levels for the team based on congressional needs and product 
demand. As we continue to assess anticipated future work and science 
and technology issues that will be of interest to the Congress, we have 
hired and plan to continue hiring to add expertise in areas such as 
biological/life sciences, computer/systems/electrical engineering, applied 
math/engineering/computer science, nuclear physics, quantum computing 
and physics/aerospace engineering. 
 
In addition to permanent staff, we are exploring actively recruiting 
temporary or limited-term staff to meet project-specific needs, particularly 
around the latest science and technology advances. Such staff could 
include experts from the National Academies or Intergovernmental 
Personnel Act detailees. We will seek additional authorities if necessary 
to obtain needed expertise. 
 
Technology assessments. Our technology assessments analyze the 
latest developments in science and technology, draw attention to 
implications of technological change, and make core concepts accessible 
to policymakers. The content of technology assessments varies. They 
may: 
 
•  highlight potential short-, medium-, and long-term impacts of scientific 
advancement and/or technological development; 
•  elaborate on and communicate the risks and benefits associated with 
a technology, including early insights into the potential impacts of 
technology; 
•  highlight the status, viability, and relative maturity of a given 
technology—especially in the context of a complex acquisition 
program; 
•  evaluate federal investments in science and technology; and 
•  present policy options designed to inform decision makers on 
potential courses of action and the opportunities and challenges 
associated with each option. 
Technology assessments time frames depend on their scope, but they 
can be completed within several months. Figure 1 highlights some recent 
technology assessments.

Figure 1: Examples of Technology Assessments 
 
  Page 5  GAO-20-430T 
 
Science & Tech Spotlights. We also provide Congress with foresight 
through our Science & Tech Spotlights. Launched in 2019, Spotlights are 
two-page overviews for policymakers and the public. Each describes an 
emerging science and technology development, the opportunities and 
challenges it brings, and the relevant policy context. Spotlights are 
designed to inform Congress of key developments in a timely and efficient 
manner, generally before congressional requests for deeper inquiries. 
Spotlights are completed in a few to several weeks. Our first four 
Spotlights, address blockchain (GAO-19-704SP), hypersonic weapons 
(GAO-19-705SP), opioid vaccines (GAO-19-706SP), and probabilistic 
genotyping software (GAO-19-707SP)–with the latter topic now requested 
as part of a full technology assessment project. In the near future we will 
publish Spotlights addressing 5G wireless technology; CRISPr1 (clustered 
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) gene editing; deep fake 
videos; and nuclear microreactors. 
 
Science and technology horizon scanning and issue tracking. In 
addition to working on specific foresight-related products, our staff 
continually perform horizon scanning to support Congress. Further, 
awareness and evaluation of trends in science and technology are part of 
our ongoing strategic planning efforts in GAO’s 2018-2023 Strategic Plan 
for Serving Congress and the Nation, including genome editing, artificial 
intelligence and automation, quantum information science, brain 
computer interfaces and augmented reality, and cryptocurrencies and 
blockchain. Our staff track advancements in these areas to inform our 
current and future products and services. The issues we focus on will 
change over time as our horizon-scanning identifies new priority issues. 
 
Our ongoing work develops science and technology content across a 
mixture of product types, key topics, and for a variety of congressional 
committees. Figure 2 shows selected current work in science and 
technology. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1CRISPr technology is a simple yet powerful tool for editing genomes. It allows 
researchers to alter DNA sequences and modify gene function. Its many potential 
applications include correcting genetic defects, treating and preventing the spread of 
diseases and improving crops.

Addressing Complex and  Increasingly sophisticated threats and frequent cyber incidents 
Growing Cyber Security  underscore the continuing and urgent need for effective information 
security. In FY 2019, our Information Technology and Cybersecurity team 
Threats 
hired nearly 30 new information technology/cybersecurity analysts— 
positioning us to expand our body of work in this area. Our work identified 
cybersecurity vulnerabilities in areas including weapon system 
acquisitions, the 2020 U.S. Census, and information systems at the 23 
civilian agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. 
Given the 2017 Equifax data breach and the potential for fraud, we also 
reviewed the federal government’s reliance on commercial consumer

reporting agencies to help verify the identities of people who apply for 
benefits online and recommended that the National Institute for Standards 
and Technology (NIST) issue related guidance for alternative verification 
methods. 
 
 
Our work will continue to include the security of federal information 
  systems, such as key agencies’ capabilities for preventing and 
addressing security incidents; the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, 
 
such as financial markets, telecommunications, and the electricity grid; 
 
and the security of taxpayer and consumer information. 
 
Assisting Congress in  Congress has provided significant funding to DOD—including about $695 
Overseeing the  billion in FY 2020—and charged GAO with conducting oversight of DOD 
activities to ensure effective and efficient use of these resources. GAO’s 
Department of Defense 
oversight of DOD has consistently contributed to meaningful advances 
within the department and significant benefits for the taxpayer. For 
example, in FY 2019, DOD implemented our recommendations to better 
counter insider threats by incorporating risk assessments into its insider- 
threat programs; improve military installations’ compliance with drinking 
water regulations by clarifying its reporting requirements for violations of 
these regulations; and enhancing collaboration within the Nuclear 
Weapons Council Standing and Safety Committee by working with the 
Department of Energy to formally define the roles, responsibilities, 
structure, and functions of this critical body. 
 
Our defense-related work over the last year led to substantial cost 
savings, including a $1.08 billion reduction in DOD’s Operation and 
Maintenance budget due to excess balances that we had identified. GAO 
also provided Congress with timely, insightful information on DOD’s 
development, testing, and acquisition of major weapon systems. 
Congressional actions implemented our recommendations that DOD 
inject more discipline into its processes for buying major weapon 
systems; as a result, taxpayers saved more than $160 billion over the 
past 10 years. 
 
In the coming year, GAO will continue to support Congressional oversight 
of DOD through traditional audit work, testimonies at congressional 
hearings, special publications, and technical assistance, such as budget 
justification reviews. This work, much of it directed by the FY 2020 
National Defense Authorization Act, which contained 112 provisions 
directing GAO reviews, an increase of 44 percent from the prior year, will 
focus on key areas of interest to the congressional defense committees. 
  Page 8  GAO-20-430T 
 
Assisting Congress with  Putting the nation on a sustainable fiscal path requires that the 
Health Care Challenges  government better understands and restrains the growth in health care 
spending—about 27 percent of the federal budget. We have studies 
 
underway to examine how drug prices compare across federal programs 
 
(Medicare, Medicaid, and VA), how prices in the U.S. compare with those 
  in other countries, and how direct-to-consumer advertising may inflate 
federal health care spending. More work is also needed to assess the 
 
integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which together 
 
accounted for approximately one quarter of federal spending and an 
  estimated $104 billion in improper payments in FY 2019. 
 
 
Notably, Medicaid improper payments grew from $36 billion to $57 billion 
 
in FY 2019. We worked with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
  Services (CMS) and OMB to improve the Medicaid portion of the 
Compliance Supplement, which is used by state auditors during their 
 
annual audit of state entities that administer federal financial assistance 
 
programs. The resulting changes to the Compliance Supplement will 
  better position state auditors to detect concerns within their state’s 
  Medicaid program. 
 
 
In FY 2020, we will continue to assist Congress by building on our work in 
  areas such as veterans’ health issues. For example, we are currently 
  conducting original data collection and analysis on the number of 
veterans who have committed suicide on VA property and on the actions 
 
VA has taken in response to these deaths. 
 
Assisting the Congress in  The Congress continues to use GAO’s work to inform key legislative 
Shaping Legislation  decisions. Recent examples linked directly to GAO’s work include: 
 
•  The Appropriations Act of 2020 (and explanatory statements). 
Based on GAO’s work, Congress required agencies to submit reports 
on their progress in implementing GAO recommendations related to 
•  simplifying, and increasing transparency and outreach for a 
student loan forgiveness program, 
•  evaluating a program that offers Pell grants to about 8,000 
incarcerated students, and 
•  securing Census’s platform and personal data and mitigating risks 
identified by GAO. 
Congress also directed the Secretary of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs to implement GAO recommendations intended to improve 
recruitment and retention initiatives for healthcare providers in rural 
  Page 9  GAO-20-430T 
 
and highly rural areas and other recommendations related prescribing 
drugs as part of veteran health treatment and improving oversight of 
opioids in the treatment of veterans, credentialing health providers 
who treat veterans to prevent disqualified providers from delivering 
patient care, and staffing and training patient advocates at the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. 
 
•  National Defense Authorization Act of 2020 (and committee 
reports). Based on GAO work 
•  Consistent with our work on potential widespread power outages 
resulting from cyberattacks against industrial control systems that 
support grid operations, the legislation included the Securing 
Energy Infrastructure Act, which requires federal agencies and the 
energy industry to craft a national plan addressing cyber threats to 
the electric grid. 
•  Congress directed the Secretaries of Labor and Defense to 
implement several GAO recommendations related to defense 
contracting, TRICARE improper payments, and Department of 
Defense whistleblower protection. 
•  The committee also commended GAO for its report on unmanned 
aerial systems and pilot promotion rates and directed the 
Secretary of the Air Force to establish a mechanism to review the 
justifications for non-operational staff positions requiring pilot 
expertise at regular intervals and to report to the committee on the 
mechanism to be established to accomplish these periodic 
reviews. 
•  The Fostering Undergraduate talent by Unlocking Resources for 
Educations Act (The FUTURE Act). Consistent with our June 2019 
recommendation, Congress directed the Department of Education to 
obtain IRS taxpayer data to verify student-loan borrower income 
information, which will save an estimated $1.8 billion over 5 years. 
•  The Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019. Consistent with our 
past work on improper payments, Congress passed legislation that 
codifies and enhances current improper payments law. These 
enhancements include more guidance on agency risk assessments 
and improper payment estimates, a requirement for OMB to report an 
annual governmentwide estimate, and a process for clearer and more 
consistent reporting on programs that do not comply with improper 
payments criteria. This bill also establishes an interagency working 
group on payment integrity. 
  Page 10  GAO-20-430T 
 
  •  The Pallone-Thune Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal 
Enforcement and Deterrence Act. The Congress directed the 
 
Commissioner to consider the findings from GAO’s report on 
combating the fraudulent provision of misleading or inaccurate caller 
 
identification information when promulgating rules to help protect 
  subscribers from receiving unwanted calls or text messages from a 
caller using an unauthenticated number [spoofed calls]. 
 
•  The Building Blocks of STEM Act. Consistent with our 2018 work 
  on STEM education programs, Congress modified the National 
Science Foundation (NSF) grant programs that support STEM 
  education; instructed the NSF to improve the focus of research and 
development on early childhood education when awarding grants 
 
under the Discovery Research PreK-12 program; and specified how 
NSF grants to increase the participation of underrepresented 
 
populations in STEM fields may be used for research into various 
  subjects. 
  •  The Federal Advance Contracts Enhancement Act (FACE Act). 
The bill, which passed the Senate, codifies numerous GAO 
  recommendations relating to the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency regarding its management of advance contracts in future 
 
disasters. 
  •  The Taxpayer First Act. Also reflecting our work, the Congress 
directed the Commissioner of the IRS to improve IRS’s efforts to verify 
 
a taxpayer’s identity and help prevent identity theft refund fraud and 
develop a comprehensive customer service strategy and protect IRS 
 
whistleblowers against employer retaliation. 
 
Financial Benefits. In FY 2019, we documented a record $214.7 billion 
Financial and 
in financial benefits for the government—a return of about $338 for every 
Program Benefits  dollar invested in us. Our average return for the last five years is about 
$171 to $1. We have also reached a return of at least $100 to $1 for 
seven of the last eight years. Examples of our financial benefits included 
contributing to the (1) reductions in the Department of Defense’s (DOD) 
procurement costs for weapon systems acquisitions ($136.1 billion); (2) 
reductions in the Department of Education’s cost estimates for student 
loans ($24.2 billion); and (3) improvement in the Internal Revenue 
Service’s (IRS) efforts to combat identity theft refund fraud ($900.2 
million). 
 
Other Benefits. Many other benefits resulting from our work cannot be 
measured in dollars but lead to program and operational improvements. 
In FY 2019, we recorded 1,418 of these other benefits. For example, our 
work on public safety and security: 
  Page 11  GAO-20-430T 
 
•  led the Congress to establish grant programs to test for and remediate 
sources of lead in school drinking water, including replacing old water 
fountains; 
•  spurred awareness and wide-ranging discussions on weapon system 
cybersecurity vulnerabilities based on our work; and 
•  helped prompt the Congress to hold hearings on how best to protect 
consumers’ internet privacy in the wake of several high-profile 
incidents where consumers’ personal data were improperly shared 
over the internet. 
Similarly, our work related to vulnerable populations: 
 
•  led VA’s Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to issue a suicide 
prevention media and outreach management standard operating 
procedure—outlining its oversight structure, including roles and 
responsibilities, to help ensure continuity of its suicide prevention 
efforts; 
•  prompted the Congress to include provisions in the Every Student 
Succeeds Act to improve outcomes for children in foster care; and 
•  led the Indian Health Service—which provides health care to 
American Indians and Alaskan Natives via its Purchased/Referred 
Care Program—to take action aimed at improving program needs 
estimates and continuity of services. 
Furthermore, our work in the area of agency operations: 
 
•  prompted the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to improve 
the tools used by its asylum officers to help them better distinguish 
between applications that comply with law and those that do not; and 
•  led the Census Bureau to fully implement 79 of 107 recommendations 
we have made over the past decade to address serious concerns 
about the bureau’s ability to conduct a secure and cost-effective 2020 
count of the nation’s population—a high-risk area since 2017. 
 
 
 
Evaluating Federal  Executing on the plan provided to Congress outlining our use of the $24 
million in supplemental disaster audit appropriations GAO received in FYs 
Disaster Response 
2018 and 2019, we have issued 34 reports and have another 21 audits 
and Recovery Issues  underway as of February 19. (See GAO’s Disaster Assistance Webpage.) 
We have expended about $13.1 million and expect to expend $10 million 
of the supplemental appropriations in FY 2020-2021 on these audits. In 
  Page 12  GAO-20-430T 
 
FY 2019, this work yielded 19 products and 52 recommendations in four 
key areas: 
 
•  Disaster Contracting. FEMA strengthening how it plans, coordinates, 
and tracks its contracts. To address this issue, the Senate passed the 
Federal Advance Contracts Enhancement Act. 
•  Disaster Response. FEMA and the American Red Cross including 
key mass care organizations in coordination and planning efforts and 
for HHS to address deficiencies highlighted by recent hurricanes, 
such as insufficient staffing at emergency operations centers. 
•  Disaster Assistance. FEMA addressing challenges that some 
individuals who are older or have disabilities may have faced 
registering for and receiving assistance from FEMA and its nonfederal 
partners. 
•  Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands. FEMA addressing funding, 
oversight, and recovery challenges. 
 
 
 
Building Bodies of  Through the products issued this year, we continued to build on bodies of 
work related to our three broad strategic goals. Examples include: 
Knowledge 
 
•  High-risk areas. In early 2021, we will issue the next full biennial 
update of our High Risk Report to the new Congress to focus attention 
on government operations that are vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, 
and mismanagement or need transformation. 
In our last report, issued in March 2019, we offered solutions to 35 
high-risk problems (GAO-19-157SP). Over the past 14 years (FYs 
2006 through 2019) financial benefits to the federal government due 
to progress in addressing high-risk areas totaled about $520 billion— 
averaging $37 billion per year. Since our 2017 report, seven areas 
improved, three regressed, two had mixed progress, and the balance 
were largely unchanged. 
•  Fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. In spring 2020, we will 
issue our next duplication, overlap, and fragmentation report. We 
anticipate that it will continue to identify new recommendations for the 
Congress and executive branch agencies. Our 2019 annual report 
identified 98 new actions that could reduce fragmentation, overlap, 
and duplication, or provide other cost savings and revenue 
enhancement opportunities across the federal government 
(GAO-19-285SP). 
  Page 13  GAO-20-430T 
 
  Significant progress has been made in addressing many of the 805 
actions that we identified from 2011 to 2018 to reduce costs, increase 
 
revenues, and improve agency operations. As of March 2019, the 
Congress and executive branch agencies had fully addressed 436 (54 
 
percent) and partially addressed 185 actions (23 percent) of these 805 
  actions—yielding about $216 billion in financial benefits between 2010 
and 2018, with $46 billion more projected in the future. This work has also 
 
led to key other (non-financial) benefits, including (1) identifying and 
addressing skills gaps in mission-critical occupations at the IRS, and (2) 
 
providing active duty service members, veterans, and their families with 
  better care from improved management of DOD and VA health care 
programs. 
 
 
Focusing on  Serving Our Clients. In FY 2019, GAO received requests for work from 
90 percent of the standing committees of the Congress. We issued 678 
Congressional 
products and made over 1,600 recommendations. Our senior executives 
were asked to testify 97 times before 50 different committees or 
Priorities 
subcommittees on a wide range of issues that touched virtually all major 
  federal agencies. 
 
 
Outreach Efforts. I continued to meet with the Chairs and Ranking 
  Members of congressional committees to obtain their views on GAO’s 
work, including their priorities, and to discuss opportunities and 
  challenges facing our Nation. In addition, we continued to highlight the 
status of key recommendations, citing progress made, and the benefits of 
 
full implementation. In FY 2019, agencies implemented 77 percent of our 
  recommendations against a target of 80 percent—matching our 2018 
performance. I also continued to send letters to the heads of most federal 
  departments, recognizing their progress in implementing our priority 
recommendations and calling attention to those still requiring action. 
 
These letters were also sent to congressional committees of jurisdiction to 
inform their oversight and published on our website. 
 
 
The hard work and dedication of our diverse and professional 
Managing Our 
multidisciplinary staff positioned GAO to achieve a 95 percent on-time 
Internal Operations  delivery of our products in FY 2019. Our performance also indicates that 
staff received the support needed to produce high-quality work. We met 
or exceeded the targets for our seven people measures—exceeding our 
targets for new hire rate, retention rate with retirements, staff 
development, staff utilization, effective leadership by supervisors, and 
organizational climate; and met our target for retention rate without 
retirements. GAO also remained a federal employer of choice, ranking 
  Page 14  GAO-20-430T 
 
third among mid-size federal agencies as a best place to work and first for 
supporting diversity by the Partnership for Public Service. 
 
In FY 2019, GAO again received an unmodified or “clean” opinion from 
independent auditors on our financial statements for FY 2019 and our 
internal control over financial reporting. There was no reportable 
noncompliance with provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, 
and grant agreements tested. We demonstrated that all detailed 
performance and financial information is complete and reliable in order to 
achieve high standards for accuracy and transparency. 
 
We also continued efforts to support our fourth strategic goal to maximize 
our value by enabling quality, timely service to the Congress and being a 
leading practices federal agency. We made progress addressing our 
three internal management challenges: managing a quality workforce; 
improving the efficiency of our engagements; and ensuring the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of GAO’s information technology 
services. With this budget request, we are planning to achieve and 
maintain 3,250 FTE in FY 2021. 
 
Information Technology. GAO’s information technology infrastructure 
serves as the backbone/foundation upon which all its work is produced. 
As such, this vital function must constantly be updated, improved, and 
secured. In FY 2020, GAO rolled out a new updated virtual desktop 
infrastructure that enhances staff’s ability to perform its duties in a secure 
and robust environment. 
 
While GAO has worked hard to improve its capacity to support Congress, 
there remains very important work to accomplish. GAO’s priorities for IT 
development in FY 2020 include consolidating and virtualizing all data 
center components and infrastructure with automatic failover for business 
continuity and disaster recovery capability needs and migrate to cloud 
computing infrastructure. 
 
We are also requesting funding to support STAA’s information technology 
and analytics capacity and data lab. Specifically, the funding will allow 
STAA to: 
 
•  equip a state-of-the collaborative space to conduct data science 
experiments, define, design, and execute advanced analytics pilot 
projects; 
  Page 15  GAO-20-430T 
 
•  build prototypes of emerging technologies such as Blockchain/digital 
ledgers as well as Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence systems; 
and 
•  develop a framework for algorithmic accountability in Machine 
Learning/Artificial Intelligence systems. 
The lab will help GAO provide Congress with critical foresight, oversight, 
and insight of science and technology issues to help ensure continued 
American innovation, competitiveness, and security. 
 
In FY 2020, we will also develop the requirements for replacing our 30- 
year-old content and records management system used to do our audits 
with a modern and secure cloud Enterprise Content Management 
solution. In the long term, this new system will allow our employees to 
work more efficiently and at the same time improve GAO’s efficiency by 
eliminating custom code and using commercial off the shelf software. In 
FY 2021, GAO will build off this requirements analysis to procure this 
important new system that will truly modernize the agency’s fundamental 
tools and establish a solid foundation for the coming years. 
 
Additionally, in FY 2021, GAO plans to complete its development and 
deployment of our platform to edit, fact check and distribute our reports 
(New Blue). New Blue will streamline the publishing processes to enable 
efficient and scalable publication of products in a responsive web-based 
format intended to accommodate the rising demand for content that is 
accessible on mobile devices and can be quickly and easily navigated by 
Congressional staff during hearings or by users on the go. 
 
Throughout these projects, GAO will enhance its security posture through 
improved and new security tools and infrastructure, while maintaining 
compliance with policy and federal standards. 
 
Facilities, Building, and Security. While most of GAO’s staff is located 
at its Headquarters in Washington, DC, GAO maintains a presence in 
strategic locations where federal activities take place throughout the 
country. GAO is always working to ensure our headquarters and field 
office locations operate as efficiently as possible, and we continue to 
reduce our real property footprint as we identify opportunities through the 
leasing process. 
 
As reported in our FY 2019 financial statements, GAO has deferred 
maintenance at its headquarters building, which now exceeds $80 million. 
This includes heating and air conditioning infrastructure and major 
  Page 16  GAO-20-430T 
 
  electrical equipment that are original to our building and past their useful 
life. GAO is requesting additional funding to begin addressing deferred 
 
maintenance and protect this valuable asset from quickening 
deterioration. 
 
 
Our Office of the General Counsel (OGC) handled about 2,200 bid 
Legal Work 
protests and issued approximately 600 decisions on the merits. OGC also 
  issued several decisions related to the Antideficiency Act and agencies’ 
use of appropriated funds during the partial government shutdown. For 
 
example, we concluded that the U.S. Department of the Interior (Interior) 
  violated the purpose statute and the Antideficiency Act when, during a 
lapse in Interior’s appropriations, it obligated certain fees for expenses 
  that it normally would charge to annual operating appropriations. GAO 
concluded that the General Services Administration (GSA) did not violate 
 
the Antideficiency Act when it obligated available appropriations to enter 
  into an interagency agreement with the National Park Service to reopen 
the Old Post Office Observation Tower during the same period. 
   
During FY 2019 and FY 2020, OGC increased the number of attorneys 
 
assigned to the appropriations law team as encouraged by Congress. 
Specifically, we added 3.5 attorneys in FY 2019, which included an 
 
attorney detailed from another legal team for 6 months. However, the 
  team also lost two attorneys. For FY 2020, as of February 21, we have 
added three additional attorneys and plan to add five additional attorneys 
 
(through lateral hiring and transfers) to bring the total appropriations law 
staff to 18 attorneys by the end of March 2020, doubling the size of the 
 
team since FY 2018. We have also reorganized the office to ensure 
  adequate resources to respond to informal inquiries as well as formal 
requests. The additional funding requested for FY 2021 will allow GAO to 
 
enhance the resources allocated to its important appropriations law 
functions. 
 
 
As the nation confronts a series of both new and long-standing 
Strategic Planning 
challenges, this plan describes our goals and strategies to support the 
Congress to identify cost savings and other financial opportunities; to 
make government more accountable, efficient and effective; and 
ultimately to improve the safety, security, and well-being of the American 
people. GAO’s Strategic Plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for 
how the agency will support the most important priorities of Congress and 
the Nation (GAO-18-396SP). This plan reflects the full scope of the 
federal government’s operations, as well as emerging and future trends 
that may affect government and society. As part of our strategic planning 
process, we emphasize foresight, continuous environmental scanning, 
  Page 17  GAO-20-430T 
 
and trend analysis as essential to helping inform our decision-making and 
long-term planning. 
 
  The current strategic plan framework summarizes these global trends 
affecting government and society, as well as the strategic goals and 
 
objectives (GAO-18-1SP) that guide our work and key efforts that detail 
near-term priorities and bodies of work (GAO-18-395SP). 
 
 
The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, 
Center for Audit 
enacted in December 2014, authorized GAO to establish a Center for 
Excellence 
Audit Excellence (CAE) to build institutional auditing capacity and 
promote good governance by providing training and assistance to federal, 
state, local and other national audit offices around the world. The Center 
has proven its initial concept and demand for the Center’s services, 
domestically and internationally, continues to increase. The Center, in its 
fourth year of operations, has met its goals of: 
 
•  expanding services in developing countries, 
•  establishing strategic partnerships with donor organizations, 
•  providing online registration for group training, and 
•  improving internal operations. 
Bolstering operations. Moving forward the Center seeks to bolster its 
operations as demand for its services continues to expand, particularly 
with international organizations in countries that receive federal funds. For 
FY 2019 Congress appropriated approximately $34 billion for foreign 
assistance, including Global Health, Development Assistance, Foreign 
Military Financing, and Migrations and Refugee Assistance. Building the 
capacity of National Audit Organizations across the globe helps produce 
high-quality auditing functions that can improve oversight of U.S. foreign 
assistance and hold governments accountable for using public funds 
efficiently and effectively and deterring and addressing corruption. 
 
In FY 2021, GAO seeks to use a portion of its appropriation for up to five 
permanent staff and related expenses to enhance GAO’s capability to 
support Center operations. The Center’s expansion of services calls for 
utilizing additional permanent staff for core operations/administrative 
functions, online/web-based technical support staff, instructors to support 
on-the-ground services, and as well as contract services for interpretation 
and translation. The Center will continue to operate a fee-based model for 
projects.

We value the opportunity to provide Congress and the nation with timely, 
Concluding Remarks 
insightful analysis on the challenges facing the country. Our FY 2021 
budget requests the resources to ensure that we can continue to address 
the highest priorities of the Congress. 
 
Our request will allow us to continue building our staffing level and 
provide our people with the appropriate resources and support needed to 
serve the Congress effectively. This funding level will also allow us to 
continue efforts to promote operational efficiency and address long- 
deferred investments and maintenance. We will also continue to explore 
opportunities to generate revenue to help offset our costs. 
 
I appreciate, as always, your careful consideration of our budget and your 
continued support. I look forward to discussing our FY 2021 budget 
request with you.

NOT FOR PUBLICATION 
UNTIL RELEASED BY THE  
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON DEFENSE  
Chairman Shelby, Vice Chairman Durbin, distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, thank 
you for your bipartisan efforts to build the strength and readiness of our integrated naval force. 
As the nation’s forward-deployed, global maneuverable team, the entire Department of the Navy 
(DON) – Sailors, Marines and Civilians – must be ready to respond as a single unit wherever and 
whenever there is need. We must deliver the personnel, platforms, and operational capability 
necessary to secure vital sea lanes, stand by our allies, and protect the American people.  
 
Accomplishing this in today’s global strategic environment demands planning, clear-eyed 
assessments, and hard choices. We must design a future integrated naval force structure, advance 
our intellectual capacity and ethical excellence, and accelerate the digital modernization of our 
force. That’s why this budget prioritizes a strategy-driven, balanced approach to investment, 
informed by relentless examination of our present capabilities and realities. It builds on prior 
investments while adjusting fire where necessary to deliver greater efficiency and effectiveness. 
It sustains the industrial base, and maintains our competitive advantage. Overall, this budget will 
deliver a more integrated, survivable, and affordable future force. 
 
Our testimony details the combined perspectives of the DON civilian and military leadership. 
We begin with the challenges we face, followed by our overall strategic vision, then the specific 
priorities of the Navy and Marine Corps to meet the requirements of this vision and execute the 
National Defense Strategy (NDS), which remains the guidepost for all of our decisions. The 
Department of the Navy sustains progress along each of the NDS lines of effort through adequate 
and timely funding from our partners in Congress. We are proud to work in partnership with this 
Committee in defense of our nation, and look forward to that work continuing. 
1 
 
The Global Challenge 
 
The reemergence of long-term great power competition, the evolving character of that 
competition, and the accelerating advancements in technology are spurring a period of 
transformation in the strategic environment, requiring us to adapt our integrated naval force 
design and operating concepts to new realities.  As the National Defense Strategy states, “there 
can be no complacency – we must make difficult choices and prioritize what is most important.” 
 
Thus far this century, terrorist groups and rogue states have dominated our perception of the 
threat environment. These threats were lethal, but did not pose an existential threat to our 
national security. China and Russia present a different challenge, as each continues to develop 
sophisticated military capabilities backed by sizable economies.  Their investments in surface, 
air, and undersea platforms have significantly increased the potential for kinetic conflict, while 
the leadership of both nations demonstrate increasing contempt for international law and the 
rules-based order that ensures the prosperity and security of all nations.  
 
China’s battle fleet has grown from 262 to 335 surface ships over the last decade, and China’s 
commercial shipbuilding grew over 60% year over year from 2007-2017.  It continues to take 
coercive actions against its neighbors and violate international law in the South China Sea. 
Russia’s irresponsible aggression continues on NATO’s eastern and northern flanks as well as 
the Black Sea, the Arabian Gulf, and the broader Indo-Pacific. China also invests heavily in 
submarines with advanced stealth capabilities and the platforms and infrastructure needed to 
dominate the emerging Arctic.  
2 
 
 
Meanwhile, warfare has evolved to new battlefields including cyberspace. China and other 
dangerous actors like Iran brazenly target the command, control, and communications (C3) 
systems and logistics networks on which our integrated naval force depends. China’s nefarious 
activity also includes widespread cyber theft of intellectual property and sensitive information 
targeting our entire government, our allies, and our industry partners throughout the acquisition 
and supply chain. 
 
As we prepare for the maturing threat of great power competition, we must remain on high alert 
for the actions of malign regimes such as Iran, and the continual asymmetric threat to our people, 
allies, and interests posed by non-state actors such as ISIS. In a recent example highlighting the 
impact of our integrated naval force, 5th Fleet and CTF-51/5 responded to crisis earlier this year 
by securing the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad with the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task 
Force – Crisis Response – Central Command (SPMAGTF-CR-CC) and simultaneously 
coordinated additional naval support in theater. We stand ever-prepared to respond with every 
part of our integrated force to instability, terrorist threats, and rogue states throughout the world. 
 
Our integrated naval force also has a critical role in preserving the infrastructure and access that 
powers the increasingly interconnected and interdependent United States and global economies. 
Our nation’s continued prosperity and economic growth increasingly depend on open and secure 
access to the sea lanes. Maritime traffic has increased four-fold over the last two decades, with 
90 percent of all global goods transiting shipping lanes, including new trade routes opening 
through the Arctic. Meanwhile, the undersea cables that power the digital economy and the 
3 
 
global communications framework represent an overlooked but critical point of vulnerability for 
American interests at home and abroad. Overall, the maritime system is more heavily used, more 
stressed, and more contested than ever before – and it has never been more important.  
 
A dominant naval force is central to the effective execution of the National Defense Strategy in a 
changing world. But as we address these external concerns, we must also confront our business 
process challenges. These include a shrinking industrial base and vulnerable supply chain, 
inefficiencies due to legacy business operations, and antiquated acquisition processes which 
together result in increased costs and delays for both new development and overall maintenance. 
And despite the best efforts of this Committee, we must also continually prepare for the 
challenge posed by funding uncertainty.  
 
Most importantly, we must never forget that our greatest resource is the men and women who 
wear the uniform, who comprise our civilian workforce, and the families that serve alongside 
them. We are committed to ensuring our Sailors, Marines, and Civilians are trained and equipped 
to execute the mission and return home safely, and that their families are provided with the 
housing, medical attention, and education they need.  
 
As detailed in the following pages, our integrated naval force has made significant strides in 
addressing the external and internal challenges we face. But we can never be satisfied, and will 
always press forward with a sense of urgency to deliver the people, the platforms, and the 
capabilities necessary to protect the American people and our interests around the world.  
4 
 
Meeting the Challenge with an Agile Integrated Naval Force 
 
To meet these challenges, the NDS requires a dominant, agile, accountable, and globally 
positioned integrated naval force. We will plan, resource, and execute the NDS with specific 
focus on the following:  
 
Integration 
We must transform from our present two-service model into one true expeditionary force in 
readiness, with the Navy and Marine Corps operating together with integrated planning, design, 
training, and execution at every echelon and in every domain. This priority has been emphasized 
in messages to the fleet and planning documents by each member of DON leadership and is a 
guiding principle for every aspect of our planning and resourcing. 
 
Velocity 
Our integrated naval force must maintain the readiness and lethality to respond anywhere at any 
time. We will achieve this through a global operating model that ensures the continual posture, 
presence, and readiness of our personnel and platforms. We will dominate the fight to get to the 
fight, with forward basing, distributed maritime capability, fully integrated logistics, and 
continual aviation readiness.  We also must increase the speed at which we do everything across 
the Department to match the rapid changes and unpredictability of the future environment. 
 
 
 
5 
 
Collaboration 
A primary line of effort in the NDS is to build and maintain a robust constellation of allies and 
partners. Our integrated naval force is committed to training, operating, and learning alongside 
our allies and partners in every part of the world through every day interaction and regular 
operational exercises such as Trident Juncture, Talisman Saber and Rim of the Pacific 
(RIMPAC). Afloat and ashore, our allies and partners are crucial force multipliers and enablers 
of our global reach, particularly in evolving regions such as the Indo-Pacific and the Arctic.  We 
must also break down organizational silos across our own Department and build more 
collaborative relationships with the other Military Departments and the Interagency to support 
whole of government approaches to security that will become more prominent in the future. 
 
Visibility 
While cutting edge ISR, cyber, aviation, and undersea assets ensure our global reach and 
awareness, there is no substitute for sustained presence and engagement. Through frequent port 
visits, stand-in forces, and Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPS), we will continue to 
demonstrate our enduring commitment to the defense of our people and interests, as well as our 
readiness and will to stand alongside our allies and partners. We will also focus on increasing 
transparency and information sharing in order to facilitate more rapid, and informed decisions. 
 
Innovation 
We will transform the strategic space to our advantage through next generation research and 
development, industry partnerships, and naval education. We are embracing the challenge of 
next generation technology and determined to dominate the design, development and effective 
6 
 
deployment of major technological breakthroughs such as hypersonic weapons. We are making 
the key investments and forging the key partnerships to own the next “Sputnik Moment.”  We 
will become more comfortable with trying new ways of doing business, and more forgiving of 
incremental failures made in support of change and progress.  
 
Adaptability 
Where we cannot change the strategic environment through innovation, we will adapt to it 
quickly and efficiently through agile thinking and nimble platforms. This will allow us to protect 
our people and interests through unpredictable shifting security environments, and ensure the 
broadest range of options are available to the Commander in Chief and the Secretary of Defense.  
We will invest in an adaptable force structure, foster adaptable approaches to problems, and 
nurture the development of adaptable people comfortable with uncertainty and unpredictability. 
 
Humility 
We will address our challenges with a sense of humility, taking full account of the deficiencies 
we have, but with confidence that they can be corrected.  We will be realistic in our planning and 
budgeting to assure we do not trade growth for readiness.  We will not allow ourselves to build a 
hollow force, but we will be honest with the Congress and the American people about what we 
see the areas in which we need their full support in order to build the integrated naval force that 
is required to maintain the nation’s security.

Gray Hulls: Building and Maintaining the Right Capabilities 
 
In order to meet the many demands of the global strategic environment and ensure our warriors 
are always prepared to dominate the fight, we must design a future integrated naval force 
structure aligned to the threats we face, both today and in the future. This budget prioritizes the 
readiness of those platforms and systems that will enable the United States to maintain and 
expand its competitive edge over all adversaries while we examine ways to grow the fleet in a 
reasonable timeframe, all while remaining responsible stewards of American taxpayer dollars. 
 
Divesting from 20th Century Legacy Systems 
In keeping with the DoD-wide priority to modernize from low-value legacy systems to fund 
combat-overmatch lethality tuned to the challenge of great power competition, this budget 
divests from multiple legacy or surge-based capabilities that do not align with the requirements 
of the NDS. It shifts capabilities from a counterinsurgency focus to systems that enable our 
personnel to exploit positional advantage and defend key maritime terrain for persistent forward 
sea control and denial operations. This budget also aligns with Secretary Esper’s commitment to 
become more of a “fast follower” of commercial technology, and to dominate the future 
development and employment of artificial intelligence (AI) and hypersonics funding. 
 
Building to a 355 Navy 
Thanks to the bipartisan efforts of this committee, the goal of a 355 ship Navy is now the law of 
the land. We will be working with the Office of the Secretary of Defense to develop a consensus 
perspective on this future force structure through robust analysis and wargaming and the 
8 
 
inclusion of expertise from our academic institutions (Naval War College, Naval Postgraduate 
School, Marine Corps University) and independent naval experts.  This process will be iterative 
and continuous.  In order to meet the nation’s national security needs and remain within budget 
constraints, we must consider how to shift costs away from high-end platforms to a larger 
number of smaller, but still highly capable ships.  Such a shift will allow broader presence, 
reduced manning, and longer reach through a significant increase in hypersonic weapons, greater 
stealth, and advanced anti-ISR capabilities.   
 
We are also considering how unmanned surface and subsurface platforms should figure into our 
force mix.  These platforms will not only allow us to distribute and conceal lethality, but to do so 
at a reduced cost and greater integration and interdependency with the Joint Force.  While some 
perspectives vary on the ultimate composition of this future force mix, there is clear agreement 
that certain new classes of ships that currently do not exist today must be designed and built 
rapidly in the next ten years.  The exact mix will be the subject of continuous evaluation and 
analysis, but it will not impede our immediate investment in the development and initial 
production of these new vessels. 
 
Fielding a Ready, Relevant, Responsive Integrated Naval Expeditionary Force 
A key aspect of our transformation will be a shift to greater naval expeditionary force 
capabilities and a restoration of the Fleet Marine Force. The potential for rapid change in the 
global environment, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, demands a rebalance from the current 
Marine Corps force land and surge based posture to a more distributed, rapidly deployable and 
fully integrated force. This budget continues investment in key Marine Corps development 
9 
 
programs such as the Ground Based Anti-Ship Missile, Ground Based Air Defense, CH-53K 
helicopter, and F-35B Joint Strike Fighter, supporting Marine Corps efforts to enhance Long 
Range/Precision Fires, Protected Mobility/Enhanced Maneuver, and Air Defense.  
 
Generating Readiness and Sustainability 
This budget optimizes Marine Corps readiness to achieve 80% serviceability of reportable 
expeditionary equipment, and implements the Commandant’s Infrastructure Reset Strategy so 
our warriors are always prepared and present to defend our people, our interests, and our allies. It 
sustains the shipyards and supporting industrial base to maximize repair and modernization 
capacity and minimize turnaround and downtime.  To provide continual presence and readiness 
for the fleet, this budget funds 58 days underway while deployed and 24 days underway while 
non-deployed per quarter, with an increase of 6.5% over last year for ship operations funding. 
Leveraging private sector best practices through the Naval Sustainment Strategy, this budget 
continues to invest in Aircraft Depot Maintenance to achieve the goal of 80% mission capable 
rates for strike fighter aircraft. This budget also increases the Flying Hour program by 5.8% and 
aligns the funding for air operations to the mission capable rates to ensure that all squadrons 
deploy combat-ready.  
 
Producing Next Generation Superiority 
The COLUMBIA-class submarine program enters the first year of incremental procurement   
funding for the lead ship, and this budget resources the program for on-track delivery to meet the 
first deployment in 2031, with a second ballistic missile submarine starting in FY24 and serial 
production begins in FY26, furthering the recapitalization of our Strategic Nuclear Deterrent. 
10 
 
Additionally, we continue to resource the development of the Fast Frigate, and Future Large 
Surface Combatant, both of which will greatly enhance our distributed capabilities and forward 
deployed lethality.  This budget also continues advanced capabilities in the F-35B and F-35C 
Joint Strike Fighter for both the Navy and Marine Corps. We also maintain investment in 
weapons development to provide for longer range and hypersonic weapons, with increasing 
investments in areas like Conventional Prompt Strike and our Standard Missile family.  Finally, 
we will look to Congress for support in our effort to expand training and testing opportunities 
through range expansion aboard Naval Air Station Fallon in order to fully develop and train with 
these lethal capabilities.

Gray Zones: Winning the Fight Before the Fight 
 
The future battlespace extends well beyond the field of kinetic action. Ensuring our warriors are 
the best equipped and prepared in the world starts with accelerating our digital modernization 
across the force, streamlining our business processes and maintaining the highest level of 
efficiency. Agile and accountable naval forces are impossible without agile and accountable 
business processes that support them. With the support of this budget submission, the following 
are just a few of the reforms we are implementing throughout our integrated naval force to 
dominate the future fight, from the E-Ring to the front lines. 
 
Executing the Business Operations Plan 
The President’s Budget Submission will allow us to accelerate our business process 
modernization across the naval enterprise through the use of advanced digital tools and 
technologies to substantially improve performance, speed, accuracy, and security. The DON 
Business Operations Plan (BOP) details the steps we are taking to transform our business 
operations in alignment with the NDS, with six, twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four month 
milestones to provide DON leadership the ability to better manage and monitor progress on the 
path to a more agile and accountable business enterprise. The plan provides clear direction for 
military and civilian leaders throughout the DON to maximize investments and effort in 
alignment with the NDS. It also provides greater transparency and oversight opportunities for our 
partners on this Committee as well as the American people.  
 
 
12 
 
Transforming the Digital Enterprise 
Information management is a core strategic function of the DoN. Cyber security, data strategy 
and analytics, AI, and quantum computing have all combined to create massive opportunities - as 
well as vulnerabilities - across our entire enterprise. A critical element of mission readiness is the 
ability of our personnel to have access to relevant, reliable, and secure global communications 
and information, at every echelon and in every domain. In FY19 we consolidated information 
management functions in a restructured Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO), driving 
transformation and operational capability through the following lines of effort: 
  Modernize DON infrastructure from its current state of fragmented, non-performant, 
outdated, and indefensible architectures to a unified, logical, modern infrastructure 
capable of delivering an information advantage.   
  Innovate operational capabilities through technologies like 5th Generation (5G) wireless 
and AI, and accelerate software development through Digital Innovation Centers, 
leveraging private sector and industry best practices to fuel our digital transformation. 
  Defend networks and assets through continuous active monitoring across the enterprise to 
increase cyber situational awareness. We will institute a security culture where a personal 
commitment to cybersecurity is required to gain access to the network.  We will 
transform from a compliance-centered culture to one of constant readiness, and we will 
work with our industry partners to secure naval information wherever it resides. 
 
 
 
 
13 
 
Managing Finance and Operationalizing the Audit 
We have completed the second full scope financial audit of the entire DoN, revealing more 
opportunities to improve our financial management and business processes as well as many other 
aspects of our enterprise. The financial audit is the lynchpin to both monitoring and catalyzing 
improved business operations performance.  Our senior leadership has repeatedly emphasized to 
all personnel that active participation in the audit process is not just a financial exercise, but a 
management tool that must involve the combined effort of all of our personnel in order to 
identify ways to improve our organization’s effectiveness and accountability.  
 
We are on track within the next two years to achieve qualified financial audit opinion for the 
Marine Corps, with an unqualified opinion the following year.  This will make the Marine Corps 
the first military service in the Defense Department to receive such an opinion in the history of 
the United States.  Achieving this for the Navy will be more challenging, but we continue to see 
improvements year to year.  The DON has also conducted a Zero-Based Budget review designed 
to ensure alignment of goals and resources, achieve full value for every taxpayer dollar, and 
increase transparency in our resource allocation process.  Finally, we have implemented 
Performance-to-Plan reviews that provided a fleet-focused and data-driven approach, 
accelerating readiness.  
 
 
 
 
 
14 
 
Modernizing Naval Supply Chain and Logistics 
Our integrated naval force requires unified logistics operations and secure, reliable supply chains 
in order to maintain the distributed, forward maneuverable force demanded by the global 
strategic environment. Through the audit and other reform efforts, we have identified multiple 
areas where our supply chain and logistics processes are disjointed and divided, with areas of 
poor visibility and accountability that impact our forward inventory and readiness.  
 
These efforts have also revealed areas where greater integration between the services is needed 
and where our multiple supply chains require consolidation and optimization.  We are 
developing a long-term strategy to address these deficiencies, beginning with a new modern 
vision for future integrated naval logistics and supply chain management, and will proceed with 
executing reforms consistent with this vision this year.  
15 
 
Gray Matter: Developing Our People 
 
We cannot solely define American seapower by ship counts and high-end systems. In the end, 
our core strength will always reside in the gray matter between the ears of our people as much as 
it does in the gray hulls out in our fleet. Recruiting, retaining, educating and caring for the best 
military and civilian force possible has always been and will always be our greatest edge against 
all competitors. We will meet this challenge through transformative investments in education, 
greater connections with partners and allies, a competitive human capital strategy, a 
recommitment to high quality housing for our naval families, and a determination to eliminate 
the scourge of sexual harassment and assault throughout our total force. 
 
Prioritizing Learning as a Strategic Advantage 
As stated in the 2018 Education for Seapower (E4S) report, the intellectual capability of our 
Navy and Marine Corps team and our ability to operate as a continuous learning organization 
will serve as the enduring foundation of our credible deterrent to war. In the year since the E4S 
report was completed, we have established the office of the Chief Learning Officer (CLO) and 
moved quickly to introduce sweeping changes in the structure, integration, and prioritization of 
naval education. These changes include: 
  U.S. Naval Community College - Our highest priority is to create a new United States 
Naval Community College (USNCC) that offers advanced, online technical and analytic 
education to our enlisted force in critical areas like IT, cyber, and data science.  Free for 
every Sailor and Marine, the USNCC will fill a long-neglected gap in our educational 
continuum and provide a recruiting and retention incentive through degree-granting 
relationships with major four-year public and private universities across the nation.  
16 
 
  Naval Education Strategy 2020 – Our recently released Naval Education Strategy 2020 is 
the first ever comprehensive education strategy for our integrated naval force.  The 
strategy will lay out a clear road map to develop a lifelong learning continuum for our 
entire force, reform our personnel systems to better recognize and reward the value of 
education, and invest in our schools and education programs.   
  Strategic Education Requirement for Flag and General Officers – The opportunity to 
wargame future scenarios and technologies, study naval strategy and debate alongside 
peers is vital experience for the leaders who will guide our integrated force through the 
future strategic landscape. That is why we are now requiring in-residence strategic 
studies graduate education for promotion to Flag or General Officer rank.  
 
Recruiting, Curating and Retaining the Best Talent 
This budget provides the resources to fuel a new human capital strategy to better access and 
curate best-in-class talent for our Navy, Marine Corps, and civilian work force.  We developed 
this strategy leveraging leading private sector business practices designed for the new economy. 
Initial pilot programs in support of this strategy will begin this year. The Navy’s Sailor 2025 
initiative and comparable initiatives in the Marine Corps have contributed to successful 
recruiting and retention in what should be a very challenging market.  
 
Through a combination of non-monetary, quality of life, and customer service programs, we are 
increasing our responsiveness to the needs of the individual warfighter and their family, making 
continued service a viable and attractive option. And we are increasing avenues for civilians with 
prior service through the Targeted Reentry Program, and expanding opportunities to serve in 
17 
 
meaningful civilian capacities. We are also increasing opportunities for our personnel to learn, 
operate, and innovate alongside partners in the private sector, across the joint force, and 
alongside our partners and allies.  
 
Setting Our People Up for Success 
Through USMC Global Force Management, we will continue to field an elite Active and 
Reserve Marine force, maintaining a 1:2 deployment to dwell ratio while working towards a 
necessary 1:3 ratio to preserve constant readiness and availability of personnel while also 
reserving time for training, refitting and family support. This budget increases funding and 
training for Marine Forces Pacific in support of the Commandant’s Planning Guidance and the 
NDS. The DON has also implemented over 100 of the recommendations from the Readiness 
Reform and Oversight Council (RROC) in order to maximize opportunities for our personnel to 
succeed. Among many other changes, we have increased opportunities for shipboard certification 
and skills enhancement, while adjusting manning schedules to maximize safety and improve 
quality of life and professional effectiveness for our personnel while underway.  
 
Standing Up for Our Military Families 
Our people must be confident that their leadership will look out for their interests and advocate 
tirelessly for their safety and well-being. Unfortunately, as Congress correctly identified last 
year, we have not always lived up to that responsibility, particularly with respect to our 
administration and oversight of the Military Privatized Housing Initiative (MPHI) program. We 
are committed to making sure we assess, monitor, and remediate issues of concern quickly and 
effectively through active and engaged leadership and reinforced Department-level oversight to 
18 
 
restore the trust of our residents. Over the past year, Navy and Marine Corps leaders reached out 
to all of our Sailors, Marines, and their families to inquire about on-base housing concerns and 
offered home visits to better understand those concerns. We are also leveraging technologies 
such as an app for residents to report issues and track their resolution and an Electronic Data 
Warehouse that allows leaders at every level the opportunity to spot trends and issues quickly 
and effectively. This budget also provides resources for additional personnel to advocate for 
resident needs. In total, the Navy and Marine Corps housing programs are hiring 277 more 
housing management specialists, housing inspectors, quality assurance specialists, and project 
and business managers.  
 
Combating Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment 
We are each determined to eliminate the scourges of sexual assault and sexual harassment from 
every part of our force. These behaviors stand as a betrayal of those who have stepped forward to 
serve and of every person who wears the uniform, military and civilian. Our Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) is coordinating education, outreach, care and 
prevention efforts across the force. We have reached out to university presidents and other 
civilian education leaders through our first annual symposium held at the U.S. Naval Academy in 
April 2019, as well as regional discussions in New York City in September 2019 and in 
Albuquerque, New Mexico in early February 2020. We are examining new prevention and 
education efforts including a renewed focus on junior enlisted leaders and the role of alcohol in 
sexual assault and harassment. We will continue to work with this Committee to pursue and 
share the best practices and ideas, relentlessly pursuing a future where no Sailor, Marine, or 
civilian teammate ever has to fear for their own safety while protecting us all.  
19 
 
Building a Robust Constellation of Partners and Allies 
As extraordinary as the people of our integrated naval force are, we recognize that we cannot 
meet the global challenge alone. The strategic maritime defense partnerships we maintain with 
our partners and allies around the world extend the reach and power of our force, but more 
importantly they underscore the importance of cooperation and coordination in maintaining the 
rules-based international order that enables so much of our global prosperity and security. Our 
personnel regularly train and operate alongside their foreign counterparts, test the interoperability 
of our systems, and build our collective readiness. Operational exercises, international port calls, 
joint Marine force training, aviation training and other interactions all build the personal contact 
that generates understanding and respect across national and functional lines. Our personnel 
know that through their service they are front-line diplomats for our nation, promoting through 
their professionalism and dedication the connections that strengthen our collective security and 
cultivate shared ideals that send the message that the United States is a partner worth having.   
   
20 
 
U.S. Navy Priorities 
 
The President’s FY21 budget request seeks nearly $160 billion for the U.S. Navy, an investment 
that will continue the momentum built since the release of the National Defense Strategy (NDS). 
The competition articulated in the NDS will continue for the foreseeable future and demands 
purposeful action over a long time horizon. As a result, consistent, sustained, and predictable 
funding is critical to ensure that taxpayer investments already made in the Navy are fully 
realized. We are grateful for the predictable funding we have received in recent years.  
 
We are proud of our intensely collaborative effort to deliver Integrated American Naval Power 
to the people we are sworn to defend. This integration will sustain the naval forces that our 
nation demands and our Joint Force expects. This integration will also place the United States in 
the best position to compete and win against the pacing threats we face. 
 
The guiding principle of the Navy’s portion of this budget request is to deliver decisive naval 
power, blending readiness, lethality, and capacity together to create a naval force that is agile 
and ready to fight today while also committing to the training, maintenance, and modernization 
to ensure the Navy can fight and win tomorrow. This budget submission materially advances the 
efforts that fall under these three objectives. 
 
Readiness 
The CNO’s initial guidance to the Navy stated, “Mission One for every Sailor is a ready Navy...a 
Navy ready to fight today.” The Navy must be able to conduct prompt and sustained combat at 
sea, but current readiness also supports the indispensable roles the Navy performs on a daily 
21 
 
basis: securing American commerce, which is more heavily entwined with the seas than ever; 
telegraphing resolve; and deterring conflict. These roles are enduring and timeless, but they are 
also deeply connected to the priorities articulated in the NDS. 
 
It is important to consider the historical context for this intense focus on readiness. The readiness 
landscape today differs significantly from twenty years ago. In 2000, the Navy had 318 battle 
force ships. Today, we have 293 after growing from a recent minimum of 271 battle force ships a 
few years ago. However, the number of deployed ships across the timespan from 2000 to today 
remained roughly constant. Today, we have 68 battle force ships deployed around the world. 
Sustaining this level requires many more than that number to deploy each year.  
 
These demands for naval forces have led us to forward deploy a greater proportion of the force 
and significantly increase the length of rotational deployments. The extended deployment of the 
ABRAHAM LINCOLN is an example of this trend: her 294-day deployment was the longest for 
an aircraft carrier since the mid-1970s. While her extension was the best decision we could offer 
to support the demand for forces, it does not come without consequences. When ships, aircraft, 
and submarines are deployed longer, they require more maintenance to return to sea as ready as 
they were before. Moreover, our statistics show that this relationship is sometimes non-linear: 
“surge” deployments and heavier operational use can exponentially increase the time and cost 
required to recapitalize these valuable assets. 
 
22 
 
Our approach to implementing the NDS has already led us to guard readiness more carefully by 
ruthlessly prioritizing requests for forces. The growth of the Navy over the past several years has 
also increased the denominator in the readiness equation, relieving some pressure on the force.  
 
Yet there is much more to do, and we are committed to finding and closing readiness gaps. The 
American taxpayer and the Congress have generously funded ships, submarines, and aircraft, and 
we owe it to the people we are sworn to protect and defend to be good stewards of those 
investments.  
 
We are committed to funding readiness at the maximum executable level. PB-21 makes a strong 
commitment to current readiness, acknowledging the sustained effort required to mitigate the 
effects of decades of intensive use of our ships, aircraft, and submarines. The funding requested 
for individual accounts such as Ship Depot Maintenance and Aircraft Depot Maintenance have 
increased over FY20 enacted levels, reflecting purposeful choices about what we need to be 
ready today. 
 
The Navy is already moving aggressively to ensure these funds are well spent. No reform is too 
small. Our relentless pursuit of reform has already paid dividends: our achievement of 80% 
mission-capable tactical aircraft this past year is one example. Acknowledging the challenges in 
depot-level maintenance and modernization, the CNO has directed Navy leaders to find the key 
levers of productivity that will allow us to deliver depot-level availabilities on time and in full. 
Although there is much to do, we are encouraged by the trends we are beginning to see. Our 
public shipyard workload has led us to increase hiring, increasing public shipyard end strength 
23 
 
by 16% from 2013. We are working aggressively to improve estimates of the length of time our 
platforms need to be in maintenance, level-load depot-level maintenance across our network of 
industrial partners, better integrate different maintenance organizations within the Navy, and 
utilize predictive analytics. In concert with continued discipline in guarding readiness, we 
believe that we can deliver our platforms in maintenance on time and in full. We are also grateful 
for the strong support we received from Congress in our enacted 2020 budget for a pilot program 
for private contractor shipyard maintenance in the Pacific, and request that this pilot continue. 
We value our close partnership with industry and recognize that predictability on our part will 
help incentivize our partners to grow, providing critical capacity to complement the work in our 
public shipyards.  
 
PB-21 robustly funds ship and aircraft operations, another essential element of readiness. As 
previously mentioned, it provides for 58 underway days per quarter per ship and bolsters flying 
hours for our aircraft. This directly contributes to readiness by allowing our Sailors to train to 
complex, high-end naval warfare scenarios at sea and creating the maritime expertise our nation 
expects. While there is no replacement for operating at sea, the Navy is working rapidly to 
integrate Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) training into the mix. LVC training allows units 
at all stages of force generation to maximize training for high-end warfare, and prevents the 
degradation of key warfighting competencies when platforms are undergoing maintenance.  
 
This budget request also recognizes the truth that we cannot neglect our shore infrastructure in 
favor of future force structure or other priorities without an impact to readiness. This year’s 
budget requests the largest amount of funds for Navy shore infrastructure in the past four years, 
24 
 
allowing us to create readiness at sea through increased readiness ashore. Congressional support 
for this request will also help the Navy meet its obligations to Sailors and their families, 
increasing the quality of public-private venture housing through increased oversight funded by 
approximately $35 million each year of the FYDP, addressing perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 
contamination with $44 million requested for clean-up programs, and rebuilding Navy facilities 
in the wake of recent natural disasters. 
 
Readiness at sea also depends land-based training ranges, especially for aviators and special 
warfare operators. These include the Navy’s training center in Fallon, Nevada. Expansion of this 
range is critical to maintaining our readiness today as newer weapons, released from distances 
much greater than those of just a few years ago, require a larger safety zone around target areas. 
Expanding this range will allow us to send our Sailors into combat fully prepared, providing 
realistic training and the skills they will need to win. We are committed to work with federal, 
state, tribal, and local partners to do so in a way that addresses the concerns of all.   
 
Finally, a ready Navy depends on our true asymmetric advantage: our people. PB-21 increases 
active-duty manning to keep our human capital synchronized with our force structure, raising our 
end strength by 7,300 Sailors. This reduces gaps and shortfalls at sea, directly contributing to 
readiness. Manning ships, aircraft, and submarines at sea remains a top priority, and we will 
continue to operate effectively and sustainably over time as the battle fleet grows. The budget 
also sustains the suite of efforts under the Sailor 2025 initiative and continues to transform our 
Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education (MPT&E) system to provide auditable, 
responsive services to our Sailors and responsibly reduce costs. It funds expanded educational 
25 
 
efforts to obtain warfighting advantage. Recognizing our ethical obligation to create a strong, 
positive environment for our Sailors, as well as the positive effect such an environment has on 
recruiting and retaining talent, we are committed to eliminating destructive behaviors such as 
sexual assault. We are focused on creating and sustaining a Culture of Excellence, where our 
Sailors do not merely avoid doing what is wrong, but actively pursue what is right. The Culture 
of Excellence program also leverages predictive analytics to intervene before destructive 
behaviors occur, breaking the cycle of simply responding to events.    
 
We are witnessing very good trends in recruiting and retention. This has enabled us to fill gapped 
billets at sea, reducing them from 6,500 in December 2018 to 4,900 in December 2019. We met 
our retention goals for all zones in 2019, retaining 76% of the force. We’re reforming our 
recruiting efforts, saving millions of dollars by processing forms for new accessions using 
biometric signatures. And our recruiters are exceeding their goals: 2019 saw the Navy sign the 
second-largest number of active-duty contracts, 40,756 new accessions, in the last 15 years. In an 
environment with low unemployment levels, these statistics are encouraging and demonstrate the 
America’s young people see great value in joining the Navy team. 
 
Lethality  
Deterring our competitors from malign activity requires fielding a forward-deployed, lethal naval 
force. Our competitors are heavily investing in technologies aimed at our naval forces. Across 
the Navy’s Total Obligation Authority (TOA), the capability investments directly enhancing 
current and future lethality comprise approximately 21% of the Navy’s annual budget. This 
investment can be further sub-divided into future capability (~11%) and modernization (~10%). 
26 
 
Relative to the entire Navy budget, the value proposition of our modernization investments are 
often overlooked when compared with resources applied to major ship and aircraft procurement 
accounts. Each dollar is thoughtfully applied to specific key capabilities based upon a rigorous 
analysis of iterative wargames, exercises, and experimentation.  Offensive and defensive 
modernization efforts enable our ships and aircraft to operate in the face of today’s advanced 
anti-ship and anti-aircraft systems.  
 
In particular, we increased our investments in directed energy and hypersonic weapons. In terms 
of directed energy, we request to apply $170.3 million in FY21 to our directed energy programs, 
which will rapidly advance our ship’s defensive capabilities. In terms of hypersonics, we request 
to increase our investments from $642 million in FY20 to $1.4 billion. PB-21 continues our 
focus on developing long-range, offensive fires launched from ships, submarines, and aircraft, 
including: Conventional Prompt Strike, the Maritime Strike Tomahawk, Joint Standoff Weapon 
Extended Range (JSOW-ER), the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), and the Standard 
Missile- (SM-) 6. We are moving quickly to extend the range of the carrier air wing with the 
rapid development of the MQ-25, the Navy’s first unmanned carrier based aircraft. MQ-25 does 
more than extending our reach; it lays the foundation for integrating unmanned air power into 
our carrier fleet. The combined effects of these modernization efforts extends the lethal strike 
range of the CVW into denied areas while enabling the CVN to operate outside the threat ranges 
of adversary anti-ship missile threats.  
 
The FY21 budget builds on the progress made in FY20 to pursue a networked fleet by investing 
$82 million ($395 million across the FYDP) in artificial intelligence and machine learning 
27 
 
technologies that improve decision quality and speed in combat. This networked fleet requires a 
resilient operational architecture to integrate our command and control, sensors, shooters, and 
weapons. To accomplish this, we will leverage our work on the Navy Tactical Grid to build the 
Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) alongside our Joint teammates. Protecting our 
networked forces requires building cyber resilience and security into our platforms from the 
beginning. To meet this need, the Navy will fund $4.17 billion across the FYDP to protect our 
operations, equipment, and industrial base from intrusions and ensure we have the means to fight 
through and recover from cyber-attacks. Meanwhile, we will integrate our cyber forces more 
closely with fleet operations to deliver catastrophic cyber effects as part of an integrated all-
domain naval force.  
 
These investments all support a highly maneuverable fleet that controls the high-end fight. 
Nuclear powered aircraft carriers remain crucial to this effort and the Carrier Strike Group 
remains the cornerstone of the Navy’s forward presence, sea control, and power projection 
capabilities. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier (CVN), associated air wing (CVW), surface 
combatants, and sub-surface combatants represent the most survivable and lethal maritime 
fighting force in the world, providing long-range kinetic and non-kinetic effects from distributed 
mobile platforms at sea without the need for foreign basing rights. The CVN and embarked 
CVW are vital to the Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) operating concept, providing the 
flexibility and endurance to hold large swaths of land or sea at risk for extended periods of time. 
GERALD R. FORD (CVN 78) represents a generational leap in the aircraft carrier’s capacity to 
project power on a global scale. FORD-class carriers are designed to generate a 30 percent 
higher sortie rate with a 20 percent smaller crew than a NIMITZ class carrier. This translates to 
28 
 
$4 billion savings over the life of the program generating more decisive naval power. With the 
successful completion of CVN 78's Post Shakedown Availability and subsequent Independent 
Steaming Events, finishing our work and delivering this capability to the fleet as quickly and 
effectively as possible is one of DON’s highest priorities. The Navy has learned with each test 
and is consistently bringing each of the innovative systems online. FORD is currently 
undergoing final air compatibility testing, bringing the entire carrier air wing onboard and 
progressing towards her maiden deployment. We will continue to learn, iterate and improve, 
driving down cost on each subsequent ship of her class. We are grateful for the Committee’s 
support of the program with the historic two-carrier award for CVN 80 and CVN 81 and are 
confident that the FORD class will provide the foundation for highly maneuverable and lethal 
combat power projection well into the second half of this century.  
 
Our naval logistics enterprise undergirds the effective employment of our forces in a dispersed, 
forward-deployed manner across the spectrum of conflict from daily operations into sustained 
major combat operations. Our logistics forces must provide forward-deployed repair and 
resupply as well as combat medical services to revive our forces on station. In addition, we will 
begin designing two new vessels, the Next Generation Medium Amphibious Ship and the Next 
Generation Medium Logistics Ship that will support our expeditionary forces operating in 
contested maritime spaces.    
 
Capacity 
To increase America’s naval power, we will continue to build more ships, submarines, and 
aircraft. There has been a long-standing consensus across the government that the Navy needs to 
29 
 
grow. We are focused on responsible growth, a rate of growth that ensures our ability to 
effectively maintain the fleet and to properly man, train, and equip that fleet.  
 
We appreciate the strong support from Congress for naval shipbuilding, funding last year’s 
request for 12 ships. We reaffirm our commitment to reach the 355-ship goal in a reasonable and 
strategically relevant timeline, and to augment a future 355-ship Navy with developmental and 
unmanned vessels. The pace of growth will depend on both our ability to find savings within our 
own topline. While this budget request slows the growth to 355 slightly to ensure we properly 
maintain the fleet we have, we are seeking ways to support increased rates of growth in the 
coming years. The challenges extend beyond the shipbuilding accounts, as we must also consider 
what increases in operations and maintenance accounts will be required to continue the 
momentum we have built in regaining readiness. We cannot, and will not build a hollow force 
simply to reach the 355 ship number.  Because of the rate of change in technology, we will 
continue to refine the required number of ships in an iterative fashion, in coordination with the 
Secretary of Defense, and as informed by wargaming and experimentation.  
 
The FY21 budget requests $21 billion in ship construction for 8 battle force ships and plans to 
build 44 battle force ships (plus 17 unmanned ships) over the FYDP. This procurement includes 
one COLUMBIA and one VIRGINIA class submarine each, two ARLEIGH BURKE Flight III 
destroyer, one Guided Missile Frigate, one LPD Flight II, and two Towing, Salvage, and Rescue 
ships. 
 
30 
 
Deterring a nuclear attack on the homeland remains the Navy’s most sacred duty and our number 
one acquisition priority.  PB-21 fully funds the first year of construction of the lead ship of the 
COLUMBIA class ballistic missile submarine. Over the FYDP, we plan to start construction on 
the second ship of the class in FY24 and, beyond the FYDP, to begin serial production in FY26.  
The COLUMBIA class guarantees the most survivable leg of the nuclear triad remains on patrol 
into the 2080s, ensuring the secure second-strike capability that is the foundation of strategic 
deterrence.  
 
This budget request also supports one additional VIRGINIA Class submarine in FY21, continuing 
the Block V multiyear contract awarded in December 2019, which will then procure two per year 
from FY22 through the FYDP.  Additionally, the Guided Missile Frigate [FFG(X)] program is 
proceeding well, and will provide the fleet with a lethal small surface combatant that is 
optimized towards distributed maritime operations. The Navy plans to award the lead ship of the 
class in July 2020 and the second ship of the class in FY21.  
 
We are committed to experimenting with unmanned systems, moving them beyond their current 
conceptual stage, and continuously assessing how they should be counted within the battle force. 
While we do not count unmanned ships at present, we will continue to procure our large 
unmanned surface vessel, buying 10 over the FYDP. These ships are envisioned to host both 
sensors and weapons. This procurement will transition to SCN funding by FY23. We will also 
procure 6 extra-large unmanned undersea vehicles in the FYDP which will help provide 
solutions for specific fleet needs.  
 
31 
 
This budget also procures 277 fixed and rotary wing aircraft (including 121 F-35C) and 25 
unmanned aircraft across the FYDP. We are completing the acquisition of several 
type/model/series aircraft and continuing to purchase essential capabilities, such as the advanced 
early warning provided by the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye and a new, flexible logistics capability 
in the CMV-22 Osprey.   
 
We in the Navy are honored to defend American prosperity and American values around the 
world every day. We are excited to be working closely with the Marine Corps to deliver 
Integrated American Naval Power to perform these critical and timeless roles. We are conscious 
that every tax dollar spent to increase readiness, lethality, and capacity represents more than 
buying power, but the trust and confidence of the American people. We do not take that trust 
lightly and will seek every means to spend those dollars in a deliberate, methodical, and 
responsible fashion, maximizing naval power to the fullest extent that those funds enable. Thank 
you for your strong support and continued partnership in providing and maintaining a Navy.

U.S. Marine Corps Priorities 
 
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member and distinguished members of the Committee, this statement is 
my first report to Congress and represents my assessment of the current state of the Marine 
Corps and priorities for the future. 
 
The future operating environment will place heavy demands on our Nation’s Naval Services, 
demands that the Marine Corps is not currently organized, trained, equipped, or postured to meet. 
Modernizing the Marine Corps for the era of great power competition will require significant 
adjustments to long-term Service investments, new integrated naval warfighting organizations 
and concepts of employment, and better training and education for Marines; changes that only 
Congress can help us realize.  The FY 2021 budget puts the Marine Corps on the path toward 
modernization, supports irreversible implementation of the National Defense Strategy (NDS), 
and sustains and builds our readiness to deter, fight, and win. 
 
My top priority as Commandant is to build the Marine Corps that will define integrated 
American naval power in 2030, even as it must remain ready to confront the challenges of today. 
I seek no additional resources for this effort. It is attainable with a stable budget and sustained by 
the leadership and oversight of Congress. Service modernization will require several years of 
dedicated analysis, wargaming, and experimentation on a level that we have not experienced in 
recent memory. We are committed to this effort and have already begun charting a new course. 
The Marine Corps is grateful to the Congress for its leadership and support during previous 
periods of modernization and seeks its continued support today.  
 
33 
 
Before addressing the issues of force design, readiness, resourcing, and the latest FY21 budget 
submission, it is important that I start with a few comments on our individual Marines and the 
health of the Corps.  I strongly believe that everything we do begins and ends with the individual 
Marine – the heart and soul of our institution.  On any given day, the vast majority of your 
225,000 Marines, representing every state and territory, serve honorably and perform their duties 
at home and abroad in an exemplary manner.  I am extremely proud to serve alongside them, and 
based on my discussions with members of this committee, I know that my pride in them is 
shared.  Regrettably, as several high profile incidents have revealed over the past several years, 
not all within your Marine Corps consistently adhere to our rigid standards, satisfy my 
expectations for professional behavior, or fulfill their obligations as Marines.  Addressing the 
corrosive effects of misconduct and criminality by this small yet destructive minority is a top 
priority, and I offer the following observations:  
 
The presence of the malignant individuals and sub-cultures within the institution produces a 
well-known and well-documented pattern of misogyny.  A 2018 publicized report commissioned 
by my predecessor clearly supports these observations as facts.  I have begun the process of 
exposing and eliminating these malignant subcultures from our ranks and will seek Congress’ 
continued assistance to that end.     
 
Eradicating sexual harassment and sexual assault remains a challenge across the military and the 
Marine Corps.  I acknowledge what many of you already suspect or know – after many years of 
trying, and despite our best efforts and intentions, remedial actions taken to date have not caused 
the desired outcomes.  I seek to address this problem head on.   
34 
 
 
There are some within our ranks who remain hesitant to accept gender-integrated training at our 
enlisted recruit depots. I would remind those Marines that the Corps has conducted gender 
integrated training at Officer Candidates School for more than two decades, with outstanding 
results.  I have every reason to believe that we can replicate that model in our enlisted recruit 
depots, and have already begun moving forward expeditiously, with the continued support of 
Congress.  I understand the direction and the effort the Marine Corps must take to comply with 
the specified timelines for both MCRD Parris Island and MCRD San Diego in the 2020 NDAA 
that will meet the intent of Congress and the needs of the Marine Corps. 
 
The Marine Corps is a warfighting organization.  We exist for that one purpose; to fight and to 
win.  All that we do is standards-based in order to produce a premier expeditionary warfighting 
force for the Nation.  In some occupational specialties within our Corps, there are legitimate 
operationally-derived physical requirements that every Marine must meet.  Marines who meet 
these standards, regardless of biological sex or gender, will face no artificial barriers to their 
service or advancement.  
 
Appropriately addressing all of these issues becomes even more paramount as we design a future 
Marine Corps that is optimized to meet the challenges of 2030 and beyond.  As we consider the 
skills, education, and capabilities required of the next generation of Marines, we must be able to 
recruit and sustain a force that draws from 100% of our Nation’s collective reservoir of talent, 
innovation, creativity, and patriotism.  I take it as a personal responsibility to do everything 
35 
 
within my authority to ensure that the Marine Corps does not create any artificial barriers to 
service or advancement.  
 
Force Design is my top priority as stated in my Commandant’s Planning Guidance.  Over the 
next three to five months, we will continue to refine and deepen the analytical depth of our initial 
planning through an iterative process of wargaming, analysis, and experimentation.  That work 
will directly support the redesign of our Corps.  Our collective Fleet Marine Forces, as well as 
our HQMC organization and many of its processes, to include the existing Planning, 
Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process, require a comprehensive overhaul to 
create the necessary level of naval integration across the Department.  Naval integration with the 
CNO’s Staff, with the fleets, and within the Department remains a top priority for me, the CNO, 
and the Secretary.   
 
Thanks to your continued support, your Marine Corps remains the Nation’s most ready force.  
We have made forces available for deployment to meet Combatant Commander requests around 
the globe, often on short notice.  Those deployed Marine Units reinforce our commitment to U.S. 
allies and partners and serve to uphold the international rules-based order.  Wherever deployed 
globally, your naval expeditionary forces facilitate conventional deterrence, prevent fait 
accompli scenarios from developing, and successfully compete against malign maritime gray 
zone activities to assure our allies and partners of our continued commitment.  This will not 
change.   
 
With your support, over the previous two years we have been able to satisfy increased global 
force management demands, including those made on our legacy fixed-wing aircraft squadrons.  
36 
 
However, we should be careful not to confuse availability with operational suitability.  Readiness 
must be more than a mere measure of availability.  True readiness, which we define as the 
readiness of a unit to be employed against a peer threat to achieve decisive tactical and 
operational outcomes, requires investment in modern capabilities commensurate with those of 
the threat.  This will require a significant shift from our most recent FY21 budget submission.  I 
would also respectfully submit that it may require a reassessment of our existing processes and 
metrics for assessing unit readiness – true readiness as described above.  Within the Marine 
Corps, I am sustaining and reinforcing initiatives started by my predecessors that will increase 
the realism of pre-deployment training to more closely align with scenarios identified in the 
NDS.  In addition, following a path that I readily acknowledge has been charted over the course 
of decades by the Army, we have added an extensive program of force-on-force training to our 
long-standing live-fire combined arms training exercise program. 
 
With these goals in mind, over the coming months, we will make significant changes to the 
organization of our Training and Education Command, which will require the support and 
consent of civilian leadership for full implementation.  Additionally, it is not lost upon me that 
our desert training facilities, superbly adapted as they have been to preparing for the challenges 
of the last three decades, are less than ideal for the kind of integrated naval training and 
experimentation that we need to prepare for great power competition in contested littoral 
environments.  Identifying and developing first class littoral training areas will be one of my 
priorities going forward, for which I will ask your guidance and support. 
 
37 
 
Regarding this FY21 budget submission, I am well aware that our budget requests since the 
release of the NDS two years ago have changed only marginally year-to-year.  While the 
cumulative impact of those marginal changes is in some cases substantial, many were budgetary 
actions that merely shifted funding within existing programs.  This is not the kind of substantive 
change now needed, nor will it result in the premier naval expeditionary force required to 
implement the NDS and realize our evolving naval and joint concepts.  In fact, our major 
programs of record prior to the formulation and release of the NDS – F-35, CH-53K, MV-22, 
ACV, and JLTV – have actually grown.  As I stated in my Commandant’s Planning Guidance, 
these and other programs – all of which were constructed to support a long-standing but now 
obsolescent conception of large-scale amphibious forcible entry – require a critical review.  I 
expect that review will likely recommend major revisions and reductions to some of our major 
programs.  We must then reinvest those resources into capabilities more relevant to the future 
security and warfighting environment, many of which we are developing but have yet to procure. 
 
This necessary divestment and subsequent reinvestment process is a complex effort, and one that 
prudence dictates be conducted in the most thoughtful and analytically defensible manner 
possible.  While it may be shocking to some for a Service Chief to openly criticize existing 
programs and priorities, our shift to the future is in no way an indictment of previous decisions or 
conclusions of those who once sat at this table or of any who provided oversight in the past.  The 
simple fact that the strategic environment has changed significantly and that we are now in an era 
of great power competition, mandates that we must make the necessary adjustments to our naval 
warfighting concepts and accompanying investment plans to create true readiness – operationally 
relevant and available naval forces that create overmatch over anticipated adversaries.  I 
38 
 
understand there are both structural impediments to change as well as strong interests resisting 
change; however, as I stated during my confirmation – I will always provide my best military 
advice and ultimately defer to and support the decisions of the civilian leadership within the 
Department and Congress. 
 
The timing of this FY21 budget submission coincides with an inflection point for the Marine 
Corps.  Subsequent annual submissions will reflect that significant change in focus, and indeed I 
anticipate there will be opportunities even during the execution of the FY20 budget to make in-
stride adjustments with the consent and support of Congress.  Simply put, with peer competitors 
striving to supplant the role of U.S. military forces regionally and globally, we cannot afford to 
delay modernization when we see opportunities to make prudent adjustments from prior plans.  
If we are to avoid being outpaced, agility in reprogramming becomes an essential tool to apply 
where it makes sense to do so.    
 
This budget also supports our assertion that Marine forces – operating as part of an integrated 
naval force – must seamlessly integrate into and play a complementary role within a larger joint 
force.  Over the next few years, we must strive to reduce duplication of warfighting capabilities 
to only those areas that make sense tactically and operationally.  Marine Corps contributions 
should largely be unique, complementary, and tailorable to the joint mission.   
 
Beyond the issues germane to my role as Commandant of the Marine Corps – to organize, train, 
and equip Marine Corps forces in support of the Fleets and Combatant Commanders – I offer the 
following observations as a senior naval officer and member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
39 
 
 
Today’s environment of renewed great power competition demands a truly integrated naval 
force; we no longer enjoy the luxuries of internal Service focus and inefficiency that the 
“unipolar moment” allowed.  The imperative now to accelerate naval integration is driven not by 
historical example nor traditional bonds between our naval Services – it is driven by the global 
environment described in the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy.  Our 
ability to operate as an integrated naval expeditionary force within contested areas provides the 
joint force with an asymmetric advantage, an edge that we must preserve and strengthen in this 
era of great power competition.  
 
  We need adequate numbers of naval platforms and surface combatants with the lethality to 
contribute to sea control and sea denial and appropriate defensive capabilities and sensors to 
operate in a distributed manner without imposing undue burdens on other platforms.  Those 
platforms must also be affordable from both a procurement and sustainment perspective, as well 
as generate the kind of availability needed to meet future force generation requirements.  
Included in that future fleet must be adequate numbers of traditional amphibious ships as well as 
next generation amphibious ships that will enable the Fleet Commanders to employ the naval 
expeditionary force throughout a contested littoral area in a more distributed, lethal, and 
defensible manner. 
 
While our aspirations and expectations are great, I am certain that Congress expects nothing less 
from the Marine Corps.  With your continued leadership and support, we will achieve our shared 
40 
 
goals and modernize our warfighting capabilities and culture to best support the Navy, the Joint 
Force, and the Nation. 
 
 
 
   
41 
 
Closing Statement 
 
 
On behalf of our entire integrated naval force and every Sailor, Marine and civilian in the 
Department of the Navy, the three of us would like to once again thank the leadership and 
membership of this Committee for your attention, interest, and ongoing support of our men 
and women in uniform. We are also grateful to the Committee for the recent passage of the 
FY20 Defense Appropriation. By passing this legislation you have enabled many of the 
priorities identified within this document, and you’ve sent a strong signal of support to our 
people – and a stern warning to our adversaries.  
 
We also appreciate the funding stability and predictability of the past several years. This has 
given our force the agility and flexibility necessary to address emerging threats and the needs 
of our integrated naval force, while shifting away from less beneficial and relevant spending. 
This stability has saved money for the American taxpayer. We owe it to them to ensure that 
every single dollar is invested in the most effective manner possible to fulfill our sacred oath.  
 
We urge the Committee to do everything possible to ensure continued funding stability so 
that we may implement the needed reforms and spending priorities discussed in this 
document to meet the great power challenge, protect the maritime commons, and stand in 
defense of the United States of America. On behalf of the world’s finest Marines and Sailors, 
we thank you for your time and ongoing efforts, and we look forward to your questions.

Written Statement of Administrator Mark Green, U.S. Agency for International 
Development (USAID) 
Senate Appropriations Committee 
Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs 
March 10, 2020 
 
Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Leahy, distinguished Members of the Sub-Committee: 
Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the Sahel region, the rising violence in many parts of 
that region, and some of the ways in which USAID is responding with humanitarian assistance, 
investments in community-level institution strengthening, and economic development 
programming.   
   
The urgency of this topic is clear. Across the Sahel, the recent escalation of violence has resulted 
in thousands of deadly attacks and four-times the number of conflict-related fatalities compared 
to 2012. At the epicenter of conflict—where Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger meet—more than 
2,000 civilians were killed in 2019 alone. The situation has further deteriorated in 2020; in 
Burkina Faso, violence has displaced an average of 4,000 people each day since the year began.  
 
It would be a mistake to attribute all of this violence to extremism or inter-religious conflict. But 
when conflict in the region is combined with persistent instability, extreme poverty, deteriorating 
environmental conditions, weak and often corrupt governance, and lack of economic 
opportunity, it offers fertile ground for extremists who seek to advance their own ideology and 
power.  
 
Sahel: Perception and Reality  
 
To understand the challenges of the Sahel, it is essential to recognize how large and complex the 
region is. Many people think of the Sahel as a handful of nations along the “coast” of the Sahara. 
In reality, it is a vast region that stretches from southern Mauritania to northern Ethiopia, 
touching at least 15 countries. It is not so much a modest set of nation-states as a vast, intricate 
network of informal trade and migration routes that connect clusters of often very ethno-centric 
communities. Borders are porous at best, and central government institutions are of little 
relevance to the daily lives and needs of most people. 
 
A significant portion of the people in the Sahel are always in motion, moving along trade and 
migration central routes, as well as seasonal herding and grazing patterns. As one observer told 
me during my visit to Nigeria last August, in the West we see the brush and sands of the Sahel 
and Sahara as barriers, while Africans see the landscape as an inviting ocean to be sailed upon 
from place to place.   
 
Traditions Under Pressure 
 
However, it is just as true that land and resources are precious and limited, and competition for 
those resources between and amongst ethnic groups, licit and illicit traders, farmer-herders, and 
yes, faith communities, has existed for decades, if not centuries. Over the years, disputes would 
 
 
arise and violence sometimes erupted, but the consequences and costs were managed through 
traditional dialogue, reconciliation, and mutually beneficial arrangements.  
 
But those traditional systems and institutions have been eroded in recent years by an array of 
shocks and stresses. Population pressures, drought-and-flood cycles, environmental degradation, 
and other forces have intensified poverty and suffering. With up to 80 percent of people living on 
less than $2 a day, many families struggle to feed themselves because they lack the livelihoods to 
purchase or produce sufficient quantities of food. Loss of human lives to hunger, malnutrition 
and disease, massive displacements of people, and shattered economies has made poverty more 
widespread in the Sahel than nearly any other region in Africa.  
 
Modern government institutions that have supplanted many traditional community and tribal 
structures have proven too weak and ill-equipped to respond or serve the vital role of mediation 
and conflict resolution. In the minds of many observers, the situation has been made even worse 
by corrupt and self-serving political elites. During my Nigeria visit, multiple civil society and 
faith-based leaders claimed these elite often politically exploit conflicts and disputes to shore up 
their own political constituencies and expand their public influence. These politicians use 
inflammatory radio and social media messages in ways that raise tensions, reinforce dangerous 
stereotypes, and recast disputes over resources as ideological or religious confrontations. 
 
To make the mix even more combustible, a range of groups are bringing their own violence to 
the region. They include criminal gangs exercising control over lucrative illicit trade of arms, 
cigarettes, and drugs, as well as extremist groups seeking to expand their power or advance an 
ideological agenda. Many work to exploit local tensions and grievances, economic and social 
marginalization, and abuses by government officials and security forces to recruit disaffected 
young people into their ranks. Militias, often ethnically based, are forming as a response to 
governments’ inability or unwillingness to provide security for communities. When governments 
do act, poorly trained, poorly led officials and security forces can often make things worse when 
they respond to incidents of insecurity and unrest with severe crackdowns and indiscriminate 
arrests. This sometimes exacerbates grievances against governments, sows greater mistrust, and 
wears down local resistance to recruiters’ rhetoric and worldview. 
 
Extremist Groups Already Operating  
 
That violent extremist groups are operating in the Sahel and surrounding areas has become all 
too clear in the last several years. There are currently five major violent extremist groups active 
throughout the region, including Boko Haram, the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), 
Islamic State West Africa (ISWA), Ansar al-Islam, and the Al Qa’ida affiliate Jamaat Nusrat al-
Islam wal Muslimeen, known as JNIM. There are also dozens of smaller, loosely-affiliated 
extremist groups. Operating across vast spaces and comprised of more than ten thousand 
extremists, their acts of violence have killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions 
more. 
 
The number of attacks linked to Al-Qa’ida affiliates and the Islamic State has tripled in recent 
years, and the number of associated fatalities has doubled. Over time, these armed groups have 
overrun government-led forces in strategic towns in Mali and Nigeria, turning swaths of territory 
 
 
into no-go zones for governments and security forces for extended periods of time. As the 
Committee will recall, in 2017, ISGS fighters ambushed American Special Operations soldiers 
and Nigerien partner forces, killing four Americans and five Nigeriens. Previous attacks 
targeting hotels and restaurants in Bamako, Ouagadougou, and in Côte d’Ivoire, killed nearly one 
hundred. Driven by competition and the pursuit of personal, ethnic, “religious,” and economic 
interests, these groups have taken a terrible toll on already fragile and economically marginalized 
communities.  
 
Current USAID Work 
 
Working with the Department of State and others, USAID has developed a range of initiatives to 
help respond to the growing Sahel crisis. Our humanitarian assistance aims to help relieve 
suffering. Our development assistance aims to help partners restore economic hope and prevent 
and resolve conflict. More generally, our work aims to help partners in their efforts to turn back 
the spread of criminal and extremist influence. Our implementation involves partnering with a 
diverse range of stakeholders, including community leaders, public officials, and faith and 
interfaith groups.    
 
As a reflection of the priority we place on the region, we recently launched our new Mission in 
Niger. We appreciate the support from Congress to open this new Mission. We have also 
recently opened a new office in Cameroon. These moves complement our current missions in the 
region and our Senegal-based Sahel Regional Office.  
 
Programs Addressing Underlying Conditions 
 
As we all know, the suffering and extreme poverty confronting people in the Sahel is intensified 
by a combination of underlying conditions, including a pervasive lack of economic opportunity,  
population pressures, recurrent natural disasters, and environmental degradation. To help address 
these and other conditions, our programs focus on specific areas of vulnerability, working to 
alleviate acute pressures while simultaneously fostering in people and communities the capacity 
to withstand future shocks.   
 
We invest in the Sahel on multiple levels, with agriculture as our base.  First, we finance the 
World Food Program to work with local groups to pay subsistence-level people in food in 
exchange for their labor to build community assets (like ponds) that regenerate land and harvest 
water.  At the same time, we engage with larger non-governmental organizations to increase 
vulnerable farmers’ access to seeds and teach them to use land more productively, while 
mobilizing communities to participate in the food-for-assets campaigns.  
 
Next, our Feed the Future investments, like those in Niger, Nigeria and Mali, enhance economic 
opportunities in market-based agriculture for farmers who are more stable and help communities 
across the Sahel sell their surplus crops and economically diversify so they are more resilient in 
the face of an increasingly complex set of risks, like drought and price shocks.  We have paired 
these investments with others that improve access to water, sanitation, hygiene, and health care 
to help address the individual and community-level vulnerabilities.   
 
 
 
A specific example of USAID’s effort to address underlying conditions is our flagship Resilience 
in the Sahel Enhance (RISE) program. RISE, which is active in Burkina Faso and Niger, 
employs a layered, multi-sector approach to reducing the chronic vulnerability of targeted 
populations.  This integrated program focuses on expanding economic opportunities and 
livelihoods, improving governance, and bolstering the delivery of essential services. In Niger, 
RISE programming has helped smallholder and pastoralist farmers connect to markets and 
fostered an environment for private-sector investment. It has also strengthened targeted value 
chains and helped communities better manage their own natural resources.   
 
These investments in building individual- and community-level resilience are one prong of 
USAID’s approach to address some of the underlying conditions that exacerbate poverty and 
suffering in the Sahel. But we are also focused on strengthening early warning and monitoring 
capacity so that stakeholders can intervene before key food security and nutrition indicators 
begin to deteriorate. To that end, we’ve recently contributed an additional $7.5 million to the 
Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (Comité permanent inter-État 
de lutte contre la sécheresse au Sahel [CILSS])⁠, an African-owned multilateral institution partly 
funded by member states⁠.  The contribution brings our funding for CILSS through this award to 
$16.8 million, and will enable them to improve the quality and reach of their seasonal forecasts 
and crop-monitoring reports—vital tools for farmers and governments in the harsh and 
unpredictable environment that characterizes much of the region.       
 
Programs on Peacebuilding, Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation 
 
One of the lessons USAID has learned over the years is that it is often local disputes and 
community grievances that are the main drivers of tension and violence. When competition for 
resources is intense and individuals or communities feel marginalized or aggrieved, it is essential 
that there are institutions and voices actively promoting dialogue, understanding, and 
reconciliation. 
 
The irreplaceable first step in most of our work is an informed analysis of conditions and actors. 
We strive to determine what is actually driving conflict, not what we assume is doing so. As 
leader after leader told me during my travel to Nigeria, not every dispute is religious in nature. 
Not every conflict is ethnic. We need to tailor our approaches to address real causes. 
 
In many parts of the region, we partner with “peace observers” who closely monitor local 
tensions and act as an early warning of sorts for disputes which, if left unchecked, might erupt in 
a given community.  Peace observers help us to diagnose the nature of the problem so we can 
help resolve or reduce tensions.    
 
When disputes or tensions are intercommunal in nature, our programs will often lead to 
constructive joint projects that can build cooperation and coexistence. For example, where water 
scarcity is a source of contention, we can facilitate the drilling of boreholes with shared access.   
 
More broadly, USAID’s Voices for Peace program, active in five countries across the region, 
uses radio broadcasts to strengthen social cohesion by countering misinformation and amplifying 
 
 
moderate voices of leadership⁠.  The broadcasts are tailored to the local needs and dynamics of 
each community⁠. They promote shared values.  
 
Preventing the Spread of Violent Extremism 
 
As I have indicated, much of the work we do in the Sahel aims to address drivers of stress and 
tension by accurately diagnosing the specific nature of conflict. The reality is that violent 
extremism already has a presence and is looking to expand its influence and power, as well as 
spread its toxic ideologies. An important part of our work is trying to counter efforts by these 
groups to recruit more individuals and groups to their cause.  We work with governments to 
enhance their countering violent extremism (CVE) response strategies, strengthen overall 
response to citizen needs, and promote messaging that counters extremist propaganda and 
misinformation.  
 
We target our assistance to improve the resilience of vulnerable communities targeted by 
extremist recruiters. For example, in northeastern Nigeria—where Boko Haram and ISIS West 
Africa continue to wreak havoc—we are implementing programs that provide entrepreneurial 
training, apprenticeship, and short-term employment opportunities, as well as agricultural 
livelihood activities. Each is specifically designed to erode pockets of support for these groups.  
 
In areas across the Lake Chad Basin, we work to amplify credible voices of tolerance and 
moderate ideologies.  We are working with a broad network of radio stations and social media 
outlets—a key source of news and information—to disseminate messaging with as far a reach as 
possible.  In Niger, our assisted partners are able to reach more than 90 percent of the target 
audience.    
 
Looking Ahead: The Sahel Development Partnership 
 
Last Fall, we launched the Sahel Development Partnership (SDP), an expansion of our integrated 
programming that is focusing first on Burkina Faso and Niger before expanding elsewhere. The 
SDP’s focus area consists of the Centre-Nord, and Est Provinces of Burkina Faso and the 
Tillabéri Region of Western Niger. Historically, this area has served as a crossroads for various 
ethnic communities, including nomadic herders and settled farmers who have shared the same 
marginal land and limited water resources for centuries.  Communities in the SDP’s focus area 
face shocks and stresses that include droughts, floods, food-price volatility, environmental 
degradation, population pressure, health crises, corruption, fragility, and conflict.  As a result, 
millions of people are chronically vulnerable and food-insecure, and even moderate droughts 
result in large-scale humanitarian crises.   
 
Through the SDP we are applying an integrated, layered development approach targeting areas 
most directly affected by cross-border instability. This approach layers resources strategically, 
from across different sectors and funding streams, in three lines of effort: CVE; stabilizing 
communities; and building greater resilience within communities. 
 
As part of a broader national security partnership with the Governments of Burkina Faso and 
Niger, civil society, and affected communities, we aim to demonstrate how holistic programs can 
 
 
help halt the spread of violent extremist groups, avert costly humanitarian crises, and stem the 
flow of destabilizing migration. The SDP will stabilize focus areas of the target countries by 
building local communities’ resilience and capacity to counter violent extremism through rapid-
response programs such as moderate voice radio programs, local governance support, and greater 
access to financial services in the agricultural sector. 
 
USAID is accelerating implementation of this new approach in coordination with the U.S. 
Departments of State and Defense, and other U.S. Government Departments and Agencies.  
Through the SDP, USAID intends to demonstrate within two years that it can help halt the 
spread of violent extremist groups, avert costly humanitarian crises, and stem the flow of 
destabilizing migration in a setting where recent trends are decidedly negative.  
 
The SDP’s approach focuses on strengthening community cohesion, resolving grievances and 
local conflicts, building resilience, and providing economic alternatives to counter the emotional 
appeal of extremists.  Rather than treating each set of problems as discrete development 
challenges that require separate interventions, the SDP attempts to address the intertwined nature 
of recurrent social, political, and environmental crises with the emergence of violent extremism, 
which overlap, both causally and geographically, within Burkina Faso and Niger.   
 
In parallel and complementary to the SDP, we have several large, ongoing initiatives that further 
target underlying conditions of vulnerability—including in the areas of health care, food security, 
and livelihoods. USAID is coordinating with our partners across the humanitarian and 
development spectrum to ensure that our programs are complementary and reinforcing.    
 
Long-term, multi-sector resilience programming builds sustainable local capacities to help 
families weather shocks and reduce the need for humanitarian assistance.  USAID’s resilience 
programming allows households to increase their assets, savings, and access to markets despite 
exposure to the stresses and crises described above.  Resilience programs enhance access to 
financial services, including savings, credit, and insurance; improve the management of water for 
productive and household use; promote the reclamation of land and the introduction of 
conservation agriculture; develop value-chains for agriculture and livestock, including by linking 
rural producers to high-demand urban and coastal markets; improve health outcomes, including 
in maternal and child health and nutrition, voluntary family planning, and hygiene and sanitation; 
build the capacity of local governments to deliver high-quality health care, nutrition, and 
sanitation; and strengthen the capacity of government and community organizations to mitigate 
conflict and respond to shocks such as droughts and floods. 
 
In summary, members of the Committee, we believe the Sahel is a region that requires flexible 
programs that address localized conflicts and stresses, and recognizes people often self-identify 
in terms that cross borders and ignore modern government institutions. We seek to build 
resilience, increase constructive options and opportunities for individuals (especially youth), 
resolve conflict through tailored mediation and reconciliation programs, and promote peace-and-
stability affirming messages to counter extremist propaganda. We would welcome the 
opportunity to expand our work. We pledge to continue to work closely with the Departments of 
State and Defense on a coordinated, whole-of-government approach in the region. We welcome 
your input, counsel, and appreciate your ongoing support.  
 
 
 
Thank you for allowing me to speak with you today, and I welcome your questions.

STATEMENT OF 
CHAIRMAN AJIT PAI 
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 
 
HEARING ON THE FCC’S FISCAL YEAR 2021 BUDGET REQUEST 
 
BEFORE THE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT 
U.S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
 
 
MARCH 10, 2020 
 
Chairman Kennedy, Ranking Member Coons, and members of the Financial Services and General 
Government Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here to present the Federal Communications 
Commission’s Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Request.  The Commission requests $343,070,000 for FCC 
salaries and expenses and an auction spending cap of $134,495,000.   
I’d like to take this opportunity to thank the Subcommittee for supporting the Commission’s 
work.  The funding you have provided has allowed us to pursue policies that are working and delivering 
real results for the American people.  The digital divide is closing with new fiber deployment setting 
records in both 2018 and 2019.  Broadband service is improving with average speeds skyrocketing, and 
the Internet remaining free and open.  The United States is leading in 5G with the FCC delivering low-, 
mid-, and high-band spectrum.  One national carrier now covers over 200 million Americans with 5G and 
small-cell deployment is booming.  And communications technology is making the American people 
safer and more secure with improved and more targeted wireless emergency alerts now available to the 
vast majority of our citizens.  
But of course, our work is not done.  And looking to the future, our budget request would 
modestly increase general spending by $4 million and lift the spectrum auctions cap by $2 million.  These 
additional funds would support our continuing commitment to improving and modernizing information 
technology as well as cover legally mandated pay increases for our staff.   
I last appeared before the Subcommittee on October 17, 2019, to discuss the Commission’s 
auctions process, and FCC staff appeared a month later to provide additional information related to our 
work in this area.  Even in the short passage of time since the October hearing, the Commission has 
moved ahead aggressively to accomplish its strategic goals—closing the digital divide, promoting 
innovation, protecting consumers and public safety, and reforming the FCC’s processes.  As our budget 
and strategic goals indicate, we aim to move full speed ahead in the next fiscal year.  I’d like to discuss 
with you some of the Commission’s most important priorities for the upcoming year. 
Our top priority continues to be closing the digital divide.  I’ve seen for myself what affordable 
high-speed Internet access can do for a community—for its families, its schools, its hospitals, its farms, 
its businesses—as well as the impact of its absence.  That’s why we’ve been working to promote rural 
broadband deployment by reducing regulatory burdens and reforming our Universal Service Fund (USF) 
programs to efficiently distribute funding for those areas where there isn’t currently a business case for 
the private sector to deploy on its own.  And I’m proud that during the first two years of this 
Administration, we’ve reduced the number of Americans without access to 25/3 Mbps fixed broadband 
by 30% and the number of Americans without access to 250/20 Mbps fixed broadband by about three-
quarters.   
Through our 2018 Connect America Fund Phase II reverse auction, the Commission has now 
authorized nine waves of funding totaling over $1.4 billion to expand connectivity to more than 627,000 
homes and businesses nationwide, including in Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, 
Maryland, Montana, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.  And by allocating these funds through a reverse 
auction process, we ended up reducing the costs of connecting these homes and businesses by more than 
two-thirds.   
Going forward, the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund represents the Commission’s boldest step yet 
in bridging the digital divide.  This new program will build on the success of the CAF Phase II auction 
and provide more than $20 billion over the next decade to support up to gigabit service for up to 6 million 
rural home and businesses through a competitive reverse auction.  We’ll target support to areas that lack 
access to fixed 25/3 Mbps broadband through a two-phase approach.  The first phase will address areas of 
the country that everybody agrees are unserved.  The second phase will cover areas in which the first 
phase doesn’t yield winning bidders and any areas that are partially served (for instance, some households 
in a census block are covered but the remainder are not).  And to identify eligible areas for this second 
phase, we will use the data to be gathered through our Digital Opportunity Data Collection, a new 
program to collect more granular deployment data that we adopted last August.   
Through the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, we will connect more Americans to faster 
broadband networks than any other USF program in history.  On February 28, 2020, the Commission 
adopted a Public Notice proposing bidding procedures for the first phase of the auction, which is 
scheduled to begin in October and will make up to $16 billion available for the deployment of fixed 
broadband networks across rural America.  Our staff’s initial estimate shows that in each of 25 states, 
there would be more than 100,000 locations that would be eligible for Phase I of the Fund.  The benefits 
would be felt from the Gulf Coast to Appalachia, and from the Great Plains to the Pacific Ocean.  For 
example, in Louisiana, the FCC staff estimates that approximately 188,000 rural homes and businesses 
could be eligible for Phase I RDOF bidding.  And Phase I would also have a big impact in Arkansas 
(222,000 estimated eligible locations), Oklahoma (162,000), Illinois (246,000), and West Virginia 
(130,000), just to name a few states.  
On the mobile side of the broadband ledger, we recognize that there are going to be rural areas 
where the business case for deploying 5G, the next generation of wireless connectivity, may not exist.  I 
firmly believe we must ensure that 5G narrows rather than widens the digital divide and that rural 
Americans receive the benefits that come from wireless innovation.  That’s why I intend to circulate a 
proposal soon to establish the 5G Fund.  This program would make up to $9 billion in USF support over 
10 years available to carriers to deploy advanced 5G mobile wireless services in rural America.  This is a 
major investment in rural areas that will be allocated through a reverse auction and will target hard-to-
serve areas with sparse populations or rugged terrain.   
One component of the 5G Fund bears special mention.  I’ve seen first-hand that America’s farms 
and ranches have unique wireless connectivity needs.  That’s why I intend to propose reserving at least $1 
billion specifically for deployments facilitating precision agriculture.   
In another action aimed at closing the digital divide, the Commission at our February 28 Open 
Meeting adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to expand our White Space device rules, paving the 
way for improved broadband coverage for rural Americans.  Unlicensed White Space devices operate in 
slivers of spectrum in the TV broadcast bands as well as other 600 MHz frequencies which are not being 
used for other authorized services.  These airwaves are attractive because they can deliver 
communications services over long distances, making them well-suited for wireless broadband services in 
rural areas.  As part of our balanced spectrum strategy, I am optimistic that these proposed rules would 
provide for more robust service and efficient use of White Space devices particularly in rural areas, 
without increasing the risk of harmful interference to protected services in the TV bands.  Our proposed 
rules would also provide flexibility for these devices to support applications like the Internet of Things.   
The Commission’s budget request also is essential to advancing the FCC’s strategy to Facilitate 
America’s Superiority in 5G Technology, our 5G FAST Plan.  The 5G FAST Plan includes three main 
2 
 
components: freeing up spectrum, promoting wireless infrastructure, and modernizing regulations to 
encourage fiber deployment.  I’d like to give you an update on the significant progress we’ve made on 
implementing this plan. 
During my tenure as Chairman, we have left no stone unturned in our exhaustive search for 
spectrum resources.  We have repurposed airwaves to provide licensed and unlicensed spectrum and 
leveraged our engineers’ expertise to find better and more efficient ways to use spectrum we’ve already 
allocated.  The details may be complex, but the result is simple:  American consumers are getting better 
value for the public resources they own, and our economy is better off. 
During the last 16 months, we have completed three 5G spectrum auctions.  In Auction 101, we 
auctioned 850 megahertz of spectrum in the 28 GHz band.  In Auction 102, we auctioned 700 megahertz 
of spectrum in the 24 GHz band.  And just last week, we concluded Auction 103, where bidders won 
licenses for 3,400 megahertz of spectrum in the upper 37, 39, and 47 GHz bands.  All told, these three 
auctions made available almost five gigahertz of high-band spectrum for commercial use.  To put that in 
perspective, that is more spectrum than is currently used for terrestrial mobile broadband by all wireless 
service providers in the United States combined.  And gross proceeds for these three auctions totaled over 
$10 billion. 
All of this highlights that money spent on our auctions program is an exceptionally wise 
investment.  By the end of the last fiscal year, the Commission had held 93 auctions since Congress 
granted the FCC this authority in 1993 and raised an average of $4.5 billion a year, for a total of $117 
billion sent to the Treasury.   
But despite the difficult and highly technical nature of this work, we have only used a small 
fraction of auctions proceeds—less than $2 billion of the $117 billion total raised—to operate the 
program.  That’s a massive return on the investment you’ve helped make possible over the years. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to be exceptionally active with respect to 5G spectrum auctions, 
and our focus will be on mid-band spectrum.  On June 25, for example, we will begin our 3.5 GHz 
auction, where we will make available 70 megahertz of spectrum for Priority Access Licenses.  Indeed, 
this auction will involve the greatest number of licenses—over 22,000—ever offered by the FCC in a 
single auction. 
And I am pleased to report that we’re on track to begin a C-band auction on December 8.  I know 
that the C-band proceeding is of great interest to this Subcommittee, and I am proud of the decisive action 
that the FCC majority took last month to bring this essential spectrum to market for 5G. 
When I last testified before you on the C-band, I stated that my decision in the proceeding would 
be based on four guiding principles.  First, the FCC must make available a significant amount of C-band 
spectrum for 5G.  Second, we must do so quickly.  Third, we must generate revenue for the federal 
government.  And fourth, we must ensure that the services that are currently delivered using the C-band 
can continue to be delivered to the American people. 
The Order that the FCC adopted advances each of these principles, and it’s important to recognize 
that on many of the issues we tackled there is a lot of common ground.  When it comes to making 
available a significant amount of C-band spectrum for 5G, there is broad consensus that we got it right by 
reallocating 280 megahertz of spectrum (3.7-3.98 GHz) for flexible use, including 5G.  When it comes to 
ensuring that services that are currently delivered using the C-band can continue to be delivered to the 
American people, there is broad consensus that we got it right by reserving the upper 200 megahertz of 
the C-band (4.0-4.2 GHz) for incumbent operators and by requiring winning bidders in the C-band 
auction to pay for incumbents’ reasonable relocation expenses.  When it comes to generating revenue for 
the federal government, there is broad agreement that we got it right by deciding to hold a public auction 
of C-band spectrum rather than authorizing satellite operators to conduct a private sale.  And when it 
comes to making available C-band spectrum for 5G quickly, there is broad agreement among Republicans 
3 
 
and Democrats in Congress that accelerated relocation payments should be offered to satellite operators if 
they meet deadlines for clearing C-band spectrum quickly. 
Why are these payments necessary?  The answer is simple: speed.  The Commission, wireless 
providers, and American consumers all want satellite operators to vacate the lower portion of the C-band 
quickly.  And this transition will be much faster if we align the incentives of satellite operators with the 
public interest in expedited access to that spectrum. 
To be sure, I recognize that there is disagreement regarding the amount of these accelerated 
relocation payments.  Some believe that the payments in our Order were too small; indeed, we saw 
numbers proposed that were greater than the annual GDP of Iceland.  Others have criticized them as being 
too large.  But I believe we’ve gotten it just right at a maximum of $9.7 billion. 
We arrived at this figure by working with our economists and other expert staff to determine the 
value to auction winners of having satellite operators clear the spectrum in an accelerated timeframe and 
to approximate the size of payments that would be made in the private marketplace absent holdout and 
free-rider problems.  You can find a detailed discussion of this topic at paragraphs 211 through 240 of our 
Order. 
I also think that it is important to clear up a couple of points of potential confusion about 
accelerated relocation payments.  First, they will be made by wireless carriers, not by the FCC and not by 
the American taxpayer.  And second, to the extent they impact the proceeds of the auction at all, they are 
likely to increase those proceeds.  That’s because without a strong incentive for satellite operators to 
cooperate, it will take years longer to clear this spectrum, dramatically reducing the value of this spectrum 
opportunity to wireless bidders.  It’s like repainting one’s house before selling it; yes, there are costs to 
doing that, but the costs are more than offset by the higher sales price.  And our conservative approach 
here means the costs of accelerated relocation are outweighed by the benefits to the Treasury (not to 
mention the public at large). 
In short, the idea that we would raise $9.7 billion more for the Treasury if we removed the $9.7 
billion of accelerated relocation payments from our Order is simply wrong.  As our agency’s expert 
economists informed me, this is not a matter of shifting money from one pot to the other.  Indeed, had we 
taken that step or reduced accelerated relocation payments to $1 billion, we would be likely to raise less 
revenue through our C-band auction. 
Finally, I would note that the Communications Act gives us ample legal authority to move 
forward with our approach to the C-band.  Section 316 of the Act allows us to modify the licenses of C-
band incumbents.  Section 309 of the Act authorizes a public auction of the lower 280 megahertz of the 
C-band for flexible-use, overlay licenses.  Section 303 of the Act gives us the authority to set new 
technical rules for the band.  And section 303(r) of the Act lets us require the winners of the public 
auction to pay for the relocation of the band’s incumbents under our Emerging Technologies framework. 
In addition to the C-band, we’ve been hard at work on the two other aspects of the 5G FAST 
plan—promoting wireless infrastructure and modernizing regulations to encourage fiber deployment.  
And our work to clear regulatory hurdles and facilitate infrastructure build-out is spurring record-breaking 
capital investments in essential infrastructure, including fiber-optic cables and small cells.  Indeed, 
hundreds of thousands of small cells are being deployed on an annual basis in addition to new towers, 
creating new employment opportunities for skilled employees doing this work.  Notably, Commissioner 
Carr has been at the forefront of bringing attention to the need to train more skilled infrastructure 
specialists and developing programs to address this problem. 
Thus far, I’ve discussed closing the digital divide and promoting innovation.  Our third priority is 
to continue fulfilling our important mission to enhance consumer protection and protect public safety.  
We ended last month by following up on a number of consumer protection and safety issues of 
importance to this Subcommittee.  First, we acted on the outstanding investigatory efforts of our 
4 
 
Enforcement Bureau and proposed significant fines against the nation’s four largest wireless carriers for 
apparently selling access to their customers’ location information without taking reasonable measures to 
protect against unauthorized access to that information.  We also let the carriers know in no uncertain 
terms that they may not disclose their customers’ location information to a third party without their 
customers’ express consent.  This FCC will not tolerate phone companies putting Americans’ privacy at 
risk. 
We also continue to protect American citizens and the national security of the United States.  At 
our November 2019 meeting, the FCC unanimously adopted rules to prohibit USF fund recipients from 
purchasing equipment from vendors deemed national security risks, initially designated Huawei and ZTE 
as such vendors.  In February 2020, the FCC launched an information collection from carriers on their use 
of Huawei and ZTE equipment and services in their networks. 
Under the leadership of Commissioner O’Rielly, the Commission has been reporting on and 
calling attention to the diversion of 911 fees collected at the state level.  Our latest report finds that in 
2018, over $187 million in taxpayer funds (or approximately 7.0% of all 911/E911 fees collected) that 
should have been used for the implementation and support of 911, E911, and NG911 services were 
instead used to fund other activities.  This is an outrageous misuse of these funds and an abuse of public 
trust.   
Additionally, February 17, 2020 was the effective date of Kari’s Law, which requires all new 
multi-line telephone systems—which are commonly used in hotels, office buildings, and college 
campuses—to directly route 911 calls, without the need to dial a prefix to reach an outside line.  This will 
help save lives by enabling those who need it most to reach help immediately. 
Another public safety issue involves suicide prevention and mental health.  Suicide rates in this 
country are reaching levels not seen since World War II.  Vulnerable populations are particularly at risk, 
such as veterans, rural Americans, and LGBTQ youth.  Access to trained counselors could make the 
difference between life and death.  And so, with the urging of Members of this Subcommittee, we have 
proposed to designate 988 as a new, nation-wide, 3-digit number for suicide prevention and mental health.  
If this number is implemented, those in crisis will only need to dial a 3-digit number to be connected with 
professionals who staff the current National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK).   
Another serious public safety issue involves the illicit use of contraband cellphones in prison.  
I’ve seen for myself the impact that these devices can have within and outside of prison walls, in places 
like Jess Dunn Correctional Center in Taft, Oklahoma.  We intend to continue our work in addressing this 
dangerous problem, and I want to thank Senator Lankford for his leadership on the issue. 
I am also pleased to provide you with an update on our work to combat what Chairman Kennedy 
has called “a nuisance and an intrusion into family dinners, jobs, weddings, graduations and ballet 
recitals”—robocalls.  I know this is another important concern of every member of this Subcommittee.  
Like most Americans, and like me, you are sick and tired of robocalls.  The Commission has continued its 
mission to fight robocalls—consistently our top source of consumer complaints—by allowing telephone 
providers to block suspected malicious and illegal calls by default, and we’ve taken aggressive 
enforcement action against these violators.  And last week, I shared with my fellow commissioners a draft 
Report and Order to mandate the implementation of caller ID authentication technology known as 
STIR/SHAKEN.  This technology enables phone companies to verify the caller ID information that is 
transmitted with a call and will help them identify calls with illegally spoofed caller ID information 
before those calls reach Americans’ phones.  At our March Open Meeting, we’ll vote on this item—a 
significant step toward ending the scourge of spoofed robocalls and a step supported by Congress’s 
passage of the TRACED Act.   
We’re pleased that we can absorb the costs for the TRACED Act—less than $200,000—within 
our budget, but that isn’t always the case.  For example, our staff estimates that the newly enacted 
5 
 
PIRATE Act will cost upwards of $11 million to administer, potentially bringing our total budget figure 
to $354 million.  That number would include an $8 million increase to the base budget.  Specifically, in 
order to combat the problem of illegal radio operations, the statute requires a sweeping process that will 
require new equipment and a substantial number of additional field agents to implement fully.  We are 
submitting a formal amendment to the Office of Management and Budget concerning costs associated 
with the full implementation of the PIRATE Act and will work with this Subcommittee toward 
determining a reasonable funding level for that program.   
As we move ahead in FY20 and look forward to FY21, I want to assure the Subcommittee that 
we will continue essential projects that focus on American territories and Tribal communities.  A good 
example of the former is the $950 million in long-term funding we approved last year to expand, improve, 
and harden broadband networks in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands through the Uniendo a Puerto 
Rico Fund and Connect USVI Fund.   
And with respect to Tribal communities, with the Subcommittee’s support and direction, we will 
be continuing our efforts to expand broadband opportunities on Tribal Lands.  We have increased support 
for carriers providing communications services on Tribal lands and created a priority window that allows 
Tribes to obtain free access to unassigned 2.5 GHz spectrum on rural Tribal Lands.  This priority window 
opened on February 3, 2020 and will close on August 3, 2020.  We are also following through with the 
Subcommittee’s direction to work with Tribes to ensure that the Commission is adequately addressing 
their needs. 
What’s next for the Commission itself?  During the current fiscal year, the Commission will be 
making a fresh start in a new headquarters building where we will realize rent savings of millions of 
dollars in FY21 and future years.  This Subcommittee is responsible for funding the move and we greatly 
appreciate your support.  Our staff has worked hard to develop a comprehensive plan and we are hoping 
to have a seamless move at the end of June. 
Finally, I want to thank Senator Moran once again for his leadership in prioritizing information 
technology for all agencies.  We hired a new Chief Information Officer since I last testified, and we 
continue to upgrade and modernize our systems. 
As you can see from this testimony, the FCC has been exceptionally busy and will continue to be 
so during FY21.  And we have been able to accomplish all of this because of the talents and dedication of 
our extraordinary staff.  Indeed, since I became Chairman, we have held 38 monthly Open Meeting at 
which more than 200 items were adopted, 80% of which were passed with bipartisan support.  The hard-
working men and women of the FCC serve the American public each day with skill and commitment, and 
I am deeply honored to work alongside them.

Chairman Kennedy, Ranking Member Coons, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for 
this opportunity to testify.  I am pleased to answer your questions.

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 
 
Statement by Betsy DeVos 
Secretary of Education 
on the 
U.S. Department of Education Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Request 
 
Good morning Chairman Blunt and Ranking Member Murray. 
I’m pleased to be here today to present the President’s fiscal year 2021 Budget Request 
for the Department of Education. I’m excited about our 2021 Budget proposal because it puts a 
clear focus on helping students achieve better outcomes by ending the Washington-knows-best 
controls of the past and restoring authority to States and local communities. At the same time, 
our request would invest in supporting continued economic growth and significantly improving 
services to recipients of postsecondary student financial aid.  
President Trump and I are asking Congress to take several bold steps in our request. As 
the president urged in his recent State of the Union, we ask you to help approximately one 
million students find the right education fit by creating a Federal income tax credit for voluntary 
contributions to state-based, non-profit organizations that, in turn, provide scholarships directly 
to students. To help students enter high-demand careers, we ask you to make a historic 
investment in Career and Technical Education State Grants so that every student has access to a 
high-quality CTE program. To better serve students with disabilities, we ask you to increase 
funding for State Grants under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. And to unleash 
innovation by giving local educators more control of their Federal K-12 funds, we ask you to 
consolidate several programs into a block grant for elementary and secondary education.  
But before I get into those and other proposals, I want to remind the committee that none 
of us should be comfortable with the dismal results in the latest “Nation’s Report Card.” We 
2 
 
have not seen meaningful progress in a decade, and worse yet, the most vulnerable and 
disadvantaged are actually performing worse. The failures of our education system are dooming 
too many students as they pursue further education, meaningful work, and successful lives. 
Our education system is demonstrably not preparing all students for today’s workforce, 
much less tomorrow’s. There are nearly 7 million jobs left unfilled today because employers are 
unable to find the workers with the needed skills and education.  
This skills gap is the inevitable result of America’s antiquated approach to education. Can 
we really be surprised that employers have trouble finding workers with the needed education 
and skills when the Nation’s Report Card tells us that more than 25 percent of our 8th graders 
cannot read a basic, grade-level passage? “The system” is failing far too many children, and they 
need something far better. 
The Members of this Subcommittee should recognize that the answer is not merely 
supplying more Federal taxpayer dollars. You have nearly doubled spending on K-12 education 
since 2000, from $23 billion in 2000 to just over $41 billion in 2020. You’ve increased funding 
six-fold over 40 years. The Federal taxpayer has been asked to invest $1 trillion over the past 
half-century, and the achievement gap has failed to budge. I could go on, but suffice it to say, 
there is no evidence at all that the Federal Government can simply spend its way to better 
educational outcomes.  
We must try a new approach, and I have a two-part prescription for change. 
First, we need to expand education freedom for all students. Every family in America 
should be able to choose the education setting that they believe is best for each child. Assigning 
students to schools based on district boundaries may be convenient for public school systems, 
but it clearly doesn’t work for our children, our economy, or our Nation. 
 
3 
 
Second, the Trump Administration wants to empower state and local leaders and 
educators by dramatically reducing the Federal Government’s prescriptive, compliance-driven 
role in K-12 education. Fifty-five years of steadily increasing Federal involvement in K-12 since 
enactment of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) has not improved outcomes 
or reduced the achievement gaps for our disadvantaged students. Federal rules and regulations 
often make it harder for local officials to target taxpayer resources optimally.  
You will see both of those solutions — education freedom and local control — 
throughout the President’s FY 2021 request. 
Overall, the President’s fiscal year 2021 Budget Request includes $66.56 billion in new 
discretionary budget authority for the Department of Education, an 8.4 percent reduction below 
the fiscal year 2020 appropriation. This is consistent with the Administration’s belief that we 
cannot continue to increase Federal spending for K-12 education and simultaneously expect to 
shift power and control back to local educators. Federal money inevitably comes with Federal 
rules, regulations, and burdens that constrain local educators and students. If you doubt this, 
remember that only about three percent of total K-12 spending is tied to the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act. Any superintendent will tell you that ESEA represents far more than 
three percent of the administrative burdens placed on them. 
 
EDUCATION FREEDOM SCHOLARSHIPS 
The most transformative proposal in the Administration’s fiscal year 2021 Budget is our 
Education Freedom Scholarship tax-credit proposal, which would encourage voluntary 
contributions to state-based elementary and secondary education scholarship programs. States 
could create scholarship programs that give families more education options, including public, 
 
4 
 
private, home schooling, or all of the above. My goal is to help States create more options for 
families, and the Federal government should be agnostic about which types of options are 
offered. Because the scholarships would be funded by private donations, Education Freedom 
Scholarships would not divert a single dollar away from public school students or public school 
teachers. Nor would they create any Federal entanglements for students or schools. 
  
ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION FOR THE DISADVANTAGED BLOCK GRANT 
Our 2021 Budget also would build on the 2015 Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), 
which reauthorized the ESEA and sought to restore State and local control over education by 
significantly reducing the mandates from Washington that accompany Federal education funds. 
As ESSA expires in 2020, we ask Congress to take the next logical step and block-grant Federal 
funds to States and local districts, so that people closest to students can determine how best to 
use those funds to improve student outcomes.  
Our proposed Elementary and Secondary Education for the Disadvantaged Block Grant 
would consolidate 29 Federal elementary and secondary education programs into a single 
$19.4 billion formula grant program. Funds would be allocated to the district level through the 
same need-based formulas used by the Title I program, and grantees would have discretion to use 
those funds for any authorized purpose of the consolidated programs. We believe this would 
unleash new innovation at the state and local level, and continue to expand proven reforms, 
including public charter schools, magnet schools, and student-weighted funding. 
Under the new block grant, States and school districts would continue to meet key ESEA 
accountability and reporting requirements aimed at protecting students, supporting meaningful 
school improvement efforts, and giving parents information they need to support a high-quality 
 
5 
 
education for their children. In addition to eliminating Federal overreach and empowering State 
and local educators, the consolidation of 29 formula and competitive grant programs into a single 
formula grant would allow the Department, State educational agencies, and local districts to 
reduce staffing and administrative costs over time by streamlining program administration. 
 
CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION 
President Trump has compiled an extraordinary record in spurring strong economic 
growth, creating new jobs, and increasing wage growth. The 2021 Budget would double down 
on this commitment to ensuring that every American can pursue success by increasing our 
investment in Career and Technical Education (CTE) by nearly $900 million. In particular, a 
$680 million or 53 percent increase in CTE State Grant funding supports the Administration’s 
goal of ensuring that every high school student in America has access to CTE programs that 
provide multiple high-quality pathways to high-paying, in-demand jobs. The Request also 
renews the President’s proposal to double fees under the H-1B visa program and redirect a 
portion of the proceeds—totaling an estimated $117 million—to the CTE State Grants program. 
Finally, we are seeking $90 million for CTE National Programs, an increase of $83 million, to 
spur the development and implementation of high-quality CTE programs in STEM fields and 
careers, including computer science. 
 
SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS 
We also are proposing to increase support for programs that serve more than 7 million 
children with disabilities in our Nation’s schools. The Request would provide $12.9 billion for 
Grants to States under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), an increase of 
 
6 
 
$100 million over the 2020 enacted level, while maintaining level funding for all other IDEA 
programs. Our Budget proposal urges Congress to provide more resources for States and school 
districts to ensure every student with a disability receives a high-quality education. 
 
HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS 
  Our Request for higher education programs also reflects our continued effort to 
consolidate duplicative programs and funding streams, reduce administrative burden for 
applicants and grantees, and streamline the Federal bureaucracy. The Request renews and 
expands our proposal for a Consolidated Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI) Grant program, 
which for fiscal year 2021 would combine 11 discretionary and mandatory MSI funding 
authorities into a single institutional formula grant funded at $336.3 million. 
Title III funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Tribally 
Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs) would continue to be delivered through existing 
authorities at the 2020 enacted levels. 
In addition, the President’s Budget would transform the Minority Science and 
Engineering Improvement Program (MSEIP) through a $150 million investment—an increase of 
$137.4 million. These competitively awarded grants would fund STEM activities led by HBCUs 
and MSIs located in Opportunity Zones, with the goals of both preparing the future generation of 
STEM professionals and promoting technology-based economic development in some of our 
Nation’s most distressed communities. The expanded MSEIP would target $50 million to 
HBCUs, $50 million to Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and $50 million to all other MSIs. 
The Request also renews last year’s $950 million proposal for a TRIO Student Supports 
Block Grant that would transition the TRIO programs from a complex and difficult to administer 
 
7 
 
set of Federal competitive grant programs into a single State formula grant program. Under this 
proposal, States would have discretion to use their funds to implement the best mix of activities, 
including those currently authorized under TRIO, Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for 
Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP), and the College Assistance Migrant Program, that will 
improve postsecondary access and attainment for their low-income and disadvantaged students. 
 
FEDERAL STUDENT AID 
Finally, I want to talk about Federal student aid.  I’d like to first thank Ranking Member 
Murray and Senator Alexander for their leadership in passing the bipartisan FUTURE Act, which 
included the Faster Access to Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Act, that was signed into law this 
past December. This important law marks a long-sought victory for simplifying and improving 
the FAFSA® for the nearly 20 million students and families who complete it each year. From 
day one, I have been committed to advancing these common-sense reforms, and I want to assure 
you all that my team is hard at work implementing this new law.  
However, students and families continue to face numerous challenges in financing 
postsecondary education so we must continue to rethink and modernize the federal financial aid 
system. Our 2021 Request includes proposals to simplify the Federal student loan programs and 
student loan repayment, establish reasonable loan limits for all Federal student loans, and afford 
postsecondary institutions more flexibility to help students avoid borrowing more than they will 
be able to repay. The Request also would expand Pell Grant eligibility to students enrolled in 
high-quality short-term programs offered by institutions that provide students with a credential, 
certification, or license in a high-demand field, make Pell Grants available to certain incarcerated 
students to improve employment outcomes, reduce recidivism, and facilitate their successful 
 
8 
 
reentry to society, and make crucial reforms to the Federal Work Study program to support 
workforce and career-oriented training opportunities for low-income undergraduate students. 
We hope you will continue to support our transition to the multi-year Next Generation 
(Next Gen) student aid platform, which includes building the technology and operational 
components that will help us deliver world-class services to postsecondary students and their 
families while continuously enhancing cyber security and improving accountability for taxpayer 
funds. Key enhancements include the development and implementation of an improved loan 
servicing platform and the consolidation of all customer-facing websites into a single, user-
friendly hub to complement our new mobile platform and the highly successful myStudentAid 
mobile app. These changes will give students, parents, and borrowers a seamless experience 
from application through repayment. Our request includes $1.9 billion for such improvements 
through the Student Aid Administration account, $114 million more than FY 2020 enacted 
levels. 
To carry out these reforms, we also need to ensure that the Office of Federal Student Aid 
has the professional leadership and independence needed to efficiently and effectively deliver 
each year more than $120 billion in new Pell Grants, Campus-Based Aid, and Direct Loans, 
while managing a student loan portfolio of more than $1.5 trillion held by over 42 million 
borrowers. In total assets, the Office of Federal Student Aid is the country’s biggest lender. But 
unlike banks, it does not have a clear governing structure with deep financial experience to 
provide strategic direction and oversight. Instead, the Office relies mostly on the Secretary of 
Education, along with Congress and others, for these critical roles. In 1998, when the Office of 
Federal Student Aid was established as a performance-based organization, annual aid was less 
than half of what it is today, and the Office was largely tasked with overseeing and guaranteeing 
 
9 
 
privately issued student loans. Many of the complex programs we are familiar with today—
TEACH grants, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, most income-based repayment plans—didn’t 
even exist. While just about everything in world of student aid has changed, the Office of Federal 
Student Aid's structure and governance has stayed the same. Moreover, we should all be 
concerned that political interference could distract the Office from what should be a laser-like 
focus on delivering world-class service to help students and their families finance postsecondary 
education.  
For all of these reasons, we believe it is time to consider whether the Office of Federal 
Student Aid would be a stronger and more effective organization if it had a reformed governance 
structure. As part of this discussion, we also believe Congress should consider whether FSA 
would work better as a separate organization from the U.S. Department of Education. Managing 
one of the world’s largest consumer loan portfolios requires a different set of skills than 
managing the distribution of grants to local and state educational agencies. Our Budget proposes 
to launch this overdue discussion by evaluating these issues in order to ensure that we best serve 
students and taxpayers alike. 
Each of these bold proposals marks a significant change from the status quo. I know that 
will invite criticism and handwringing. But let me urge all of us to move beyond the immediate 
discomfort of change and instead focus on the needs of the rising generation. A generation who, 
by most accounts, will be less literate than the generation before it if we do not implement 
significant changes to our approach to education. A generation who will face unprecedented 
economic change and need more nimble education options. A generation who will be more 
mobile and more connected than any in history. What they need from American education is not 
the programs we fund today, simply because we funded them yesterday and the year before that 
 
10 
 
and the decade before that. What they need is a complete rethinking and challenging of 
everything we do so that nothing stands in the way of their continued growth and success. 
Thank you again for this opportunity to lay out our 2021 Budget proposals and related 
reforms. I look forward to discussing these proposals further with you over the coming weeks 
and months as we work together to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for all 
Americans.

WRITTEN TESTIMONY BY SECRETARY WILBUR ROSS  
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE  
FISCAL YEAR 2021 BUDGET REQUEST 
 
Chairman Moran, Ranking Member Shaheen, and members of the 
Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to 
discuss President Trump’s Fiscal Year 2021 (FY 2021) Budget Request 
for the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC). 
 
It is a privilege to appear before you today. 
 
Our FY 2021 Budget reflects the President’s vision for America’s future 
and prioritizes security and prosperity for all Americans while being 
responsible stewards of the taxpayers’ dollars.   
 
I look forward to discussing this vision I share with the President, and 
how it is reflected in the Department’s resourcing decisions.  
 
The Administration is committed to working with Congress to grow the 
economy and protect our national security. 
  
Our budget achieves these goals by: providing the resources and 
workforce needed for the successful completion of the 2020 Decennial 
Census; ensuring American leadership in space; bolstering trade 
promotion, trade enforcement, and export controls to combat unfair 
foreign trade practices and secure sensitive technologies; providing 
resources for ongoing satellite acquisition and vessel recapitalization 
efforts for various missions of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA); providing data and support needed by 
businesses to invest, grow, and prosper; and supporting research and 
development in cutting-edge technologies. 
 
The FY 2021 Budget Request of $7.9 billion is a $7.3 billion decrease 
from the FY 2020 enacted amount of $15.2 billion.  This reduction is 
primarily driven by the completion of the 2020 Decennial Census, which 
accounts for a $5.9 billion decrease in the overall topline request. 
1  
 
 
One of my top priorities as Secretary has been to ensure that we have a 
complete and accurate Census.  The total request in FY 2021 for the 
Census Bureau is $1.6 billion.  I am pleased to report that with your 
support we are on budget, on schedule, and on track to accomplish this 
important mission.  
 
But the mission of the decennial census does not end with the 
completion of field operations. 
 
The FY 2021 Budget Request also supports the launch of the post-
enumeration operations for the 2020 Census and the release of data 
critical for determining apportionment and funding allocations.  
Our request for FY 2021 will continue the transformation of the Census 
Bureau organization and operations to a 21st century data-centric 
model that blends survey data with administrative and alternative 
digital data sources.  This effort will further lay the groundwork for 
enterprise-wide infrastructure in areas such as data management, 
survey sample frames, user-centric dissemination systems, and 
enhanced administrative records research. 
 
The second item I would like to raise today is an important initiative 
that urgently needs funding in FY 2021. 
 
The Budget Request seeks this Committee’s support for $15 million for 
the Office of Space Commerce (OSC).  This funding advances the 
Administration’s priority to maintain the United States’ leadership in 
space.   
 
This endeavor supports the Administration’s continued commitment to 
harness the full power of the commercial space industry, spawning 
economic growth to enhance our economic and national security as laid 
out in the President’s National Space Policy Directives.   
 
FY 2021 is a critically important building block year as we work to 
implement the transition of public facing space situational awareness 
(SSA) responsibilities from the Department of Defense to the 
Department of Commerce as set forth in Space Policy Directive 3 (SPD-
3).  In FY 2020, we have reprioritized our activities to ensure that 
2  
 
 
significant strides can be made in the SSA related activities of the U.S. 
Government, and the FY 2021 Budget continues and expands this 
critical effort. 
 
Maintaining the US leadership in SSA is essential for both national 
defense and for enabling space commerce.  Increasing congestion in the 
space environment enhances the risk of a conjunction, more commonly 
known as a collision, that could cause debris that would threaten both 
government and commercial uses of space.  In FY 2021, the Department 
of Commerce is aiming to achieve key milestones on the urgent and 
critical path for standing up an open architecture data repository 
(OADR) needed to help the industry avoid catastrophic in-space 
collisions as soon as possible. 
 
OSC, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and 
the National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
(NTIA) each contributed to the White House’s development of the 
Executive Order that was issued on February 12 to strengthen national 
resilience through space positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) 
services. 
 
In support of the Administration’s aim to enable U.S. businesses to 
compete on a level playing field, the budget requests $474.4 million for 
the International Trade Administration’s (ITA). 
 
ITA’s budget continues to prioritize fair trade on behalf of U.S. 
businesses and includes a $5 million increase in FY 2021 for the 
Enforcement and Compliance section to assist with Section 232 tariff 
exclusion processing and to conduct reviews of existing antidumping 
and countervailing duty orders to ensure the robust enforcement of our 
trade laws.  
 
The FY 2021 Budget sustains ITA’s role in modernizing the activities of 
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, commonly 
known as CFIUS, and implementing additional reviews as required by 
the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act.   
 
3  
 
 
In addition, $137.7 million is requested for the Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS).  These resources will be focused on BIS’s efforts to 
curtail illegal exports while facilitating secure trade of sensitive 
technologies in coordination with U.S. allies and close partners.   
 
Moreover, the FY 2021 Budget continues to fund BIS activities 
necessary for the timely review of exclusion requests from Section 232 
trade actions.  As of February 24, 2020, BIS has received more than 
169,000 exclusion requests and has posted decisions for more than 
112,000 of these requests.   
 
These efforts help ensure that the U.S. steel and aluminum industries 
are given a level playing field to offset global overproduction to ensure 
our domestic industry can produce materials that are critical for U.S. 
national security. 
 
To further the Department’s objective to prioritize core government 
functions that promote national security and support economic 
opportunity, the FY 2021 budget request for the National Oceanic 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is $4.6 billion.   
 
The FY 2021 Budget supports NOAA’s mission-critical activities, 
including sustaining current weather satellites to provide vital forecast 
information for hurricanes and other significant weather and space 
weather events. 
 
Specifically, the FY 2021 Budget requests $108.1 million for the 
continued development of NOAA’s Space Weather Follow On (SWFO) 
satellite program.  The SWFO program ensures that we avoid any 
discontinuity in our current satellite observation capabilities, which are 
critical to providing accurate and early warnings of potentially 
destructive space weather events.  FY 2021 funding will keep 
development of this satellite program on track to launch on the same 
rocket scheduled for a NASA research mission, thereby saving 
taxpayers millions of dollars. 
 
The Budget also requests $992 million to fully fund continued 
development of our flagship Polar Weather Satellites and Geostationary 
4  
 
 
Operational Environmental Satellite-R series (GOES-R) programs.  In 
addition, the Budget provides nearly $50 million to create a more 
efficient and effective satellite architecture and data infrastructure, 
including targeted investments in commercial satellite data.   
 
Other FY 2021 NOAA budget priorities include maintaining the 
National Weather Service (NWS) forecasting capabilities; providing 
critical support to commercial and recreational marine fisheries by the 
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS); accelerating the mapping of 
the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and Alaska; and, as part of its 
ongoing fleet recapitalization efforts, begin procurement efforts and 
initiate a detail design and construction competition for a third NOAA 
vessel that will primarily perform charting and surveying functions.  
Additionally, funding will support the continued requirements analysis 
and feasibility studies for a fourth additional vessel.  
 
The FY21 Budget continues to focus on helping American businesses 
grow and prosper.   
 
The $111.9 million request for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) 
will allow it to continue to objectively and cost-effectively produce 
critical economic indicators such as the Gross Domestic Product.  BEA’s 
FY 2021 Budget includes an increase for the creation of a new Chief 
Data Officer (CDO) to coordinate data governance and lifecycle data 
management across Commerce’s 12 bureaus. 
 
Minority-owned businesses face unique challenges in starting and 
operating businesses.  To solve this critical problem, the FY 2021 
Budget provides $10.3 million for the Minority Business Development 
Agency (MBDA).  This funding supports this Administration’s 
commitment across the entire federal government to address the 
difficulties facing minority business enterprises looking to start and 
grow.   
 
Research and development of new innovations and technologies that 
will propel American businesses and transform the global workforce is a 
department-wide area of emphasis.   
 
5  
 
 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) $737.5 
million budget request is uniquely tailored to address these challenges.  
Specifically, the FY 2021 Budget promotes U.S. innovation and 
industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, 
standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and 
improve American citizens’ quality of life. 
 
In support of the Presidential Memorandum on Maintaining American 
Leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the budget request for NIST 
doubles the investment in AI in FY 2021 to $48.9 million.   
 
NIST research will advance other industries of the future, including 
quantum information science, 5G and advanced communications, 
advanced manufacturing, and biotechnology.  
 
The FY 2021 Budget proposes the creation of a second NIST-funded 
advanced manufacturing institute to collaborate with industry in 
building the supply chains required to manufacture advanced 
technology products in the United States rather than abroad. 
 
Separately, the FY 2021 Budget includes a $60.2 million request for 
maintenance of NIST research facilities, including major renovations to 
NIST Building 1 in Boulder, Colorado. 
 
In recognition of the importance of 5G and advanced 
telecommunications to the economy, the FY2021 Budget Request for the 
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) 
is $72.2 million, a 79 percent increase from FY2020 enacted.   
 
Within this request for NTIA, there is $25 million for modernizing its 
30-year-old spectrum management systems to improve federal spectrum 
management, enhance our ability to enable more efficient utilization 
and spectrum sharing, protect from hacking, ensure data integrity and 
confidentiality, and defend our national security.  This modernization 
will help accelerate the transition to 5G and support the private sector’s 
need for additional spectrum bandwidth.   
 
6  
 
 
Funding in FY 2021 will also support NTIA’s role in implementing the 
President’s Executive Order on “Securing the Information and 
Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain,” as well as its 
leadership in representing the United States’ interests at multi-
stakeholder forums on internet governance and digital commerce.   
 
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) seeks 
authority to spend its own fee collections of approximately $3.7 billion.  
 
With this request, the USPTO will fully support its strategic and 
management priorities of issuing reliable and predictable intellectual 
property (IP) rights; optimizing patent and trademark application 
pendency; enhancing patent administrative appeal and post-grant 
processes; fine tuning trademark operations, including trademark 
administrative appeal and trial processes; conducting outreach, 
education and engagement both domestically and internationally; 
promoting and protecting patent and trademark IP rights; and 
investing in our information technology (IT) stabilization and 
modernization. 
 
In sum, this FY 2021 Budget Request is predicated upon providing the 
American taxpayers with a high return on investment while making 
difficult tradeoffs with finite resources. 
 
On behalf of the Department, I would be happy to answer any questions 
that you may have.

Testimony of Secretary Dan Brouillette 
U.S. Department of Energy 
Before the 
U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development  
March 4, 2020 
 
Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Members of the Subcommittee, it is an 
honor to appear before you today to discuss the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Budget 
Request for the Department of Energy (DOE).  
It is a great privilege to serve as the Secretary of Energy. This is my first hearing as Secretary 
with your Committee and I am thankful for the opportunity to be here to testify in this role on 
the President’s Budget Request for DOE. The Department is grateful for the support of this 
Committee for DOE’s mission and we look forward to a full-year appropriation.  
Introduction 
The President’s FY 2021 Budget Request is $35.4B for the Department of Energy to meet 
the challenges of today and tomorrow by promoting energy independence, progressing 
scientific research, and protecting the Nation.  
The President’s and the Department’s focus is on delivering to the Nation the technology, 
innovation, and capabilities necessary for energy independence, scientific progress, and 
national security. The Department continues to increase stewardship, accountability, and 
commitment to excellence. This budget request demonstrates the effective and efficient 
management of tax payers dollars entrusted to us.   
The FY 2021 Budget Request invests in DOE’s mission to advance economic growth and 
support United States national security through transformative science and technology 
innovation that promotes affordable and reliable energy through market solutions, and 
meets nuclear security and environmental cleanup challenges.  
America’s position in the global energy system is as a leading producer, consumer, and 
innovator. Access to domestic sources of clean and reliable energy will underpin a 
prosperous, secure, and powerful America for decades to come. Abundant and reliable 
energy is central to a flourishing economy. The Nation must take advantage of domestic 
resources and energy efficiency to promote competitiveness across industries. Using the 
1 
 
Nation’s energy resources of coal, natural gas, petroleum, renewables, and nuclear, 
stimulates the economy while building a foundation for future growth.  
As other countries continue to advance, the U.S. must advance as well and DOE prioritizes 
emerging technologies critical to economic growth and security, such as advanced 
computing technologies and artificial intelligence (AI).The U.S. must lead in research, 
technology, and innovation to maintain competitive advantage. To do this, supporting 
research and development (R&D), including at the Department’s 17 National 
Laboratories, is critical. The National Laboratories have served as leading institutions for 
scientific innovation in the U.S. for more than 75 years. American ingenuity at the 
Laboratories can drive tremendous technological breakthroughs leading to improvements 
across all aspects of American life. 
To understand and address threats to national security, and given the geopolitical 
environment, it is crucial that the U.S. have capabilities to address the challenges 
presented. The return to great power competition coupled with an unprecedented range 
and mix of threats requires the U.S. to maintain a diverse set of nuclear deterrent and 
nonproliferation capabilities that can provide flexible and tailored options to enhance 
deterrence and to achieve objectives should deterrence fail.  
Key to this effort is sustaining the current stockpile of U.S. nuclear weapons, 
modernizing nuclear forces and infrastructure, and maintaining deterrence in light of 
increasingly capable opponents. National security also depends on a resilient electric grid 
and successfully countering evolving and increasing cyber-attacks on networks, data, 
facilities, and infrastructure.  
The budget request advances global leadership in scientific and technological innovation 
in part through the National Laboratories, including basic research to support the 
Administration’s Industries of the Future initiative. DOE also remains committed to 
managing and cleaning up the Nation’s spent nuclear fuel and materials, and aggressively 
modernizing the nuclear security enterprise for the safety and security of America.  
Promoting Energy Independence, Progressing Scientific Research, and Protecting 
the Nation 
Within the $35.4B budget request there is $3.6B for technologies that will make the 
Nation’s energy supply more reliable and efficient for promoting energy independence 
and dominance.  
2 
 
Additionally, $5.9B is dedicated to progressing cutting-edge scientific R&D, including 
quantum information science (QIS) and AI. The budget request will fund key 
technologies such as advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, and technology transfer. 
The request also supports state-of-the art scientific tools and facilities keeping U.S. 
researchers at the forefront of scientific innovation. 
To support national security the budget requests $26.9B. Of that, $6.1B will continue 
cleanup of sites resulting from six decades of nuclear weapons development and 
production and Government-sponsored nuclear energy research. There is $19.8B for 
sustainment and modernization of the U.S. nuclear stockpile and deteriorating 
infrastructure, reduction of global nuclear threats, and resources to propel the nuclear 
Navy fleet of aircraft carriers and submarines.  
Focusing on results, the Department prioritizes intradepartmental collaboration to advance 
crosscutting initiatives such as energy storage, critical minerals, harsh environment 
materials, advanced manufacturing, exascale computing, QIS, AI, energy-sector cyber 
security, and microelectronics. 
The budget request also continues investment in early-stage research and development at the 
National Laboratories to guarantee that the U.S. is at the forefront of technology and 
innovation through investments in the Administration’s Industries of the Future initiative.  
As part of that initiative the budget request provides over $250M for Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) across the DOE enterprise. Researchers are applying AI to challenges in ways that will 
alter energy, science, and national security landscapes. AI is being applied to data collection 
in the Office of Science (SC), used by the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) for carbon storage 
through incorporation of autonomous monitoring and big data management. AI is also being 
used for materials discovery within the Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Technology research 
consortia efforts. AI is a tool used by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) 
nuclear proliferation analysts to sort through massive volumes of data from current and next-
generation sensor systems, as well as integrating data from disparate sources to identify 
anomalies that need further investigation. Research using AI is critical for advanced 
computing associated with development of models for simulation of nuclear weapons and 
their components, enhancing weapons codes and a variety of other applications. The Office of 
Cyber Security, Energy Security, & Emergency Response (CESER) will apply AI for R&D 
and demonstration of innovative tools and technologies to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber-
attacks on energy delivery systems. To support all of these efforts DOE established the 
3 
 
Artificial Intelligence and Technology Office (AITO) to coordinate and oversee efforts across 
DOE and implement the vision for cross-cutting mission relevant AI projects. 
In FY 2021, the budget request provides $249M -- $237M from SC and $12M from NNSA -- 
in support of QIS research. Supporting the National Quantum Initiative and the 
Administration’s Industries of the Future initiative, the budget request has funding for 
research activities including strategic partnerships in quantum computing and data intensive 
applications, development of quantum sensors based on atomic-nuclear interactions, 
development of quantum computing algorithms, and early-stage research associated with the 
initial steps to establish a dedicated Quantum Network.  
The budget request also emphasizes coordinated crosscutting research and seeks 
innovation of technologies for energy storage. The request includes $190M for the 
Advanced Energy Storage Initiative (AESI) to support the Energy Storage Grand 
Challenge (ESGC) -- a holistic approach to accelerate the development, 
commercialization, and use of next-generation energy storage technologies. In doing so 
the Department took existing dispersed storage efforts from the SC, Grid Modernization 
Initiative, AESI, Beyond Batteries, and others into ESGC for an integrated, comprehensive 
DOE-wide strategy. The vision for the ESGC is to create and sustain global leadership in 
energy storage usage and exports, with a secure domestic manufacturing supply chain that is 
independent of foreign sources of critical materials. 
The budget request invests $131M to establish a Critical Minerals Initiative (CMI) to 
coordinate research across the Department. Funds will be used from program offices 
including, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) with $53M, 
FE with $32M, the Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) with $1M, and SC with $45M, to 
initiate a National Laboratory-led team approach modeled after the Grid Modernization 
Laboratory Consortium to elevate and coordinate research activities.  
To promote efficiency and maximize impact, the budget request of $58.5M maintains 
momentum on the Harsh Environment Materials Initiative (HEMI) launched in FY 2020. 
This funding includes $6.5M from EERE, up to $22M from FE, and $30M from NE. The 
initiative aligns materials and component manufacturing process research for advanced 
thermoelectric power plants. Building on current applied energy programs, HEMI uses 
activities related to advanced reactor technologies and high efficiency low emission 
modular coal plants to support R&D of novel materials, integrated sensors, and 
manufacturing processes. 
4 
 
To maintain U.S. leadership in supercomputing, the budget requests nearly $710M including 
$475M from SC and $235M from NNSA ($235M). In FY 2021, funding will support 
continued development of two SC exascale systems. The first of these two exascale systems 
will be deployed in calendar year 2021 at Argonne National Laboratory, with the second 
coming on line in the 2021 – 2022 timeline at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In addition, 
the FY 2021 Budget Request supports the procurement of and site preparation for a third 
exascale system delivered to NNSA at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in FY 2023. 
The SC and NNSA partnership will bolster America’s national security by strengthening the 
next generation of scientific breakthroughs and also support to the nuclear stockpile not 
possible with today’s fastest computing systems.  
Funding in the budget request invests $176M in next-generation microelectronics 
research from SC ($45M), NE ($12M), and NNSA ($119M). 
To support fiscal responsibility and streamline DOE activities, the budget request 
eliminates the Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy (ARPA-E) program, the 
Title XVII Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program, the Advanced Technology 
Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program, and the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program.  
The phasing out of ARPA-E facilitates opportunities to integrate the positive aspects of 
ARPA-E into DOE’s applied energy research programs, including through changes to the 
implementation of the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business 
Technology Transfer program.  
Loan programs are proposed for phase out as well because the private sector is better 
positioned to finance deployment of commercially viable projects.  
To further achieve fiscal discipline and reduce taxpayer risk the request proposes to 
repeal the Western Area Power Administration’s borrowing authority that finances the 
construction of electricity transmission projects. Investments in transmission assets are 
best carried out by the private sector with appropriate market and regulatory incentives.   
Promoting Energy Independence 
 
Recognizing that the U.S. is the leader in energy technology and has among the most 
abundant and diverse energy resources in the world, including oil, gas, coal, nuclear, and 
renewables, the FY 2021 Budget Request supports a variety of efforts that emphasize and 
5 
 
strengthen the country’s unique advantage, including establishing a uranium reserve, to 
promote energy independence.  
The budget requests $3.6B for energy and related programs, funding early-stage applied 
R&D, and specifically targeted later-stage R&D to address unique challenges. DOE is 
committed to supporting energy initiatives that attract investments, safeguard the 
environment, and strengthen energy security.  
The budget requests $719.6M for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). In 
FY 2021, EERE will prioritize core lab activities, particularly in renewables and energy 
efficiency. The budget also maintains funding at the National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory. EERE’s efforts invest in early-stage research to spur private-sector research, 
development, and commercialization of critical energy technologies such as: sustainable 
transportation technologies to increase fuel diversity and improve efficiency across the 
transportation sector ($161M); renewable power generation technologies to compete with 
other electricity sources without subsidies ($160M); and energy efficiency to improve 
affordability, energy productivity, and resiliency of homes, buildings, and manufacturing 
sectors ($164M). The budget request invests in the Plastics Innovation Challenge and 
continues to support Advanced Energy Storage Initiative in support of the energy Grand 
Storage Challenge, Harsh Environment Materials Initiative, Critical Minerals Initiative, 
and other cross-cutting activities.  
The budget request divests from Weatherization and State Energy subprograms which are 
more appropriately funded at the state level.  
Innovation investments in clean energy technologies are more competitive than ever 
before and examples include: utility-scale PV solar which achieved the DOE goal of 6 
cents/kWh in 2017, three years ahead of schedule; onshore wind cost has declined by 
55% since 2008; EV battery costs have declined by 80% since 2008; and, the cost of 
LED lightbulbs have declined by over 90% since 2008.  
The request for the Office of Cyber Security, Energy Security, & Emergency Response 
(CESER) is $184.6M. CESER will invest in an all hazards approach to energy-sector 
cybersecurity. The budget request supports development of capabilities to identify, 
prevent, protect against, mitigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats during an 
emergency event that pose risk to energy delivery system operations. To do so the budget 
6 
 
request funds R&D, public and private-sector partnerships, and emergency preparedness and 
response. 
The budget requests $195M for the Office of Electricity to support the mission of secure 
and resilient sources of electricity. The investment addresses the challenges of increased 
threats to energy infrastructure, changes in supply mix and location of the Nation’s 
electricity generation portfolio, and increased variability and uncertainty of supply and 
demand. The budget request will support four priorities: to develop and implement an 
integrated North American Energy Resiliency Model; pursue a megawatt-scale storage; 
revolutionize sensing technology; and pursue transmission permitting and technical 
assistance.  
The Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) budget request is $1.2B to fund a diverse set of 
programs to advance nuclear energy technologies that are critical to the Nation’s mix of 
energy sources. The budget request supports early-stage R&D and targeted later-stage 
R&D to address unique challenges. The request has funding for the Reactor Concepts 
R&D, Fuel Cycle R&D, and Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies as well as critical 
laboratory infrastructure and safeguards needed to support nuclear energy R&D.  
Of the $1.2B for NE, $295M is for the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) project, one of the 
Department’s highest priorities. The VTR is a first-of-a-kind fast reactor that will assist 
the private sector to develop and demonstrate new energy technologies. This effort 
reinforces the Administration’s commitment to re-energize the U.S. nuclear sector with 
funds to support design and construction of the VTR.   
For the Interim Storage and Nuclear Waste Fund Oversight program, the budget requests 
$27.5M to fund the development and implementation of a robust interim storage 
program, DOE’s fiduciary responsibility for maintaining a safe and secure Yucca 
Mountain facility, and oversight of the Nuclear Waste Fund. Coupled with DOE’s funding 
for storage, transportation, and disposal R&D, the budget request supports the 
development of a durable, predictable yet flexible plan that addresses efficiently storing 
waste temporarily in the near term, followed by permanent disposal. In doing so the 
Administration will establish an interagency working group to develop this plan in 
consultation with States. The Department is committed to fulfilling the Federal 
Government’s legal and moral obligations to properly manage and dispose of the nation’s 
spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. 
7 
 
To address the immediate challenges facing the domestic uranium mining and conversion 
industries, the budget invests $150M to establish a Uranium Reserve. The Uranium 
Reserve reflects the Administration’s priority for availability of uranium in the event of a 
market disruption and supports strategic U.S. fuel cycle capabilities.  
For Fossil Energy R&D, the budget requests $730.6M to conduct research that supports 
the clean, affordable, and efficient use of domestic fossil energy resources. The program 
funds early-stage R&D with academia, the National Laboratories, and the private sector to 
generate knowledge that industry can use to develop new products and processes. Funding 
will improve the reliability, availability, efficiency, and environmental performance of 
advanced fossil-based power systems.  
The budget requests $200M net amount for the Office of Petroleum Reserves, with $187M 
for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The SPR is for strategic and economic security 
against potential interruptions in U.S. petroleum supplies, and this request supports 
operational readiness and drawdown capabilities. The budget request further proposes a sale 
of 15 million barrels of SPR crude oil to raise funds for other Departmental priorities, 
including $242M needed to fund the completion of remediation work at the NPR-1 site. The 
Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves will be funded at $13M. 
Consistent with prior budget requests, the Administration is re-proposing the sale and closure 
of the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve (NGSR), which has not been used since 
establishment in 2014. Proceeds from the sale from the NGSR contribute to deficit reduction 
and will fund current law SPR sales. The Department is also proposing to close the Northeast 
Home Heating Oil Reserve which has also never been used for the intended purposes and is 
not a good use of taxpayer funds.  
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) budget request of $128.7M will continue 
supporting the collection, analysis, and dissemination of independent and impartial energy 
information and analysis to promote sound policymaking, efficient markets, and public 
awareness and understanding. EIA will also begin a multi-year effort to modernize energy 
modeling capabilities. Expected benefits include greater agility in EIA’s modeling system to 
address key current and emerging trends. The budget request also bolsters EIA to continue 
planned cybersecurity initiatives for information security.  
Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs (IE) supports energy development and 
deployment on Indian lands, reduction of energy costs, assistance in economic development, 
8 
 
and electrification in tribal communities where unemployment and poverty rates far exceed 
national averages. The budget requests $8M for these important IE efforts. 
The budget requests $78.6M for the four Power Marketing Administrations (PMA) to sell 
electricity primarily generated by federally owned hydropower projects to public entities and 
electric cooperatives. The budget again proposes to repeal Western Area Power 
Administration’s (WAPA) borrowing authority that finances the construction of electricity 
transmission projects. Investments in transmission assets are best carried out by the private 
sector with appropriate market and regulatory incentives that support resiliency and 
reliability. The request again proposes to sell the transmission assets owned and operated by 
the PMAs, and authorize the PMA’s to charge rates comparable to those charged by for-
profit investor owned utilities. 
Reducing the government’s role in electricity transmission infrastructure ownership, and 
introducing market-based incentives for power sales from Federal dams will encourage an 
efficient allocation of economic resources and mitigate risk to taxpayers.  
Progressing Scientific Research 
The FY 2021 Budget Request includes $5.9B to progress scientific research continuing 
U.S. dominance in research and science. The budget request funds the Department’s

foundational research to support U.S.-based leadership in microelectronics. The Office of 
Science (SC) efforts in QIS include development of quantum computing and quantum 
sensor technology. QIS will benefit national security, economic competitiveness, and 
secure America’s continued leadership in science. SC’s work, particularly in the areas of 
QIS and AI, is fundamental for the Industries of the Future Initiative.  
The SC request includes $988M for Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) to 
strengthen and further U.S. leadership in strategic computing, the foundations of AI and 
QIS, and the infrastructure for data-driven science. To meet SC’s high performance 
9 
 
computing mission for the exascale project, the budget request prioritizes basic research 
in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science with emphasis on the challenges of data 
intensive science, including AI and machine learning, and computing technologies. The 
budget request increases support for ASCR’s Computational Partnerships focusing on 
developing partnerships in quantum computing and data intensive applications, and new 
partnerships in exascale and data infrastructure. The budget request also provides support 
for ASCR user facilities operations for the availability of high performance computing, 
data, and networking to the scientific community. Specifically, funds provide for exascale 
computing, QIS, and operation of user facilities. 
The request for Basic Energy Sciences (BES) is $1.9B. BES supports fundamental 
research to understand, predict, and ultimately control matter and energy at the electronic, 
atomic, and molecular levels providing foundations for new energy technologies, to 
address the environmental aspect of energy use. BES also supports DOE missions in 
energy, environment, and national security.  
The budget requests $516.9M for Biological and Environmental Research (BER) to 
support fundamental research to understand complex biological, biogeochemical, and 
physical principles of natural systems at scales extending from the genome of microbes and 
plants to the environmental and ecological processes at the scale of the planet Earth. This

science, and new efforts in translating biodesign rules to functional properties of novel 
biological polymers. The budget request also supports and continues operation of three 
BER scientific user facilities: the Joint Genome Institute, the Atmospheric Radiation 
Measurement Research Facility, and the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory. 
Fusion energy is a carbon-free energy source with enormous potential, such as 
combatting climate change, serving as a vast energy source, providing economic benefits, 
and promoting national security. The Office of Fusion Energy Sciences request is 
$425.1M for research to develop a fusion energy source and to understand matter at very 
high temperatures and densities. The budget continues to support research and facility 
operations, including research at international facilities with unique capabilities, research 
in QIS, and research in high-density laboratory plasma science. Funding for facilities 
operations includes DIII-D National Fusion Facility for magnetic fusion, the National 
Spherical Torus Experiment Upgrade facility repairs, and upgrades at the Matter in 
Extreme Conditions Petawatt facility project. The budget request also funds U.S. in-kind 
hardware contribution for the ITER international research project. 
10 
 
The budget requests $818.1M for High Energy Physics (HEP) for research to understand 
at the fundamental level how the universe works by discovering the most elementary 
constituents of matter and energy, probing interactions between and exploring basic nature of 
space and time. HEP underpins and advances DOE mission and objectives through this 
research. This effort contributes to core research activities including QIS, AI, exascale 
computing, and next-generation microelectronics. The request further funds the Accelerator 
Traineeship Program to expand workforce development in advanced technology and HEP 
facilities. 
The Nuclear Physics request is $653.2M to support research to discover, explore, and

The budget requests $20.5M for Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists which 
provides for a sustained pipeline of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics 
(STEM) professionals to meet current and future national goals and objectives. Maintaining 
U.S. leadership requires specialized computer scientists and applied mathematicians to 
develop supercomputing methods to solve real world problems today and develop technology 
of the future. The budget funds programs that place highly qualified applicants in authentic 
STEM learning and training opportunities at DOE laboratories, as well as supports the 
National Science Bowl® competition.  
The request for Science Laboratories Infrastructure is $174.1M. These funds will sustain 
mission-ready infrastructure and safe and environmentally responsible operations by 
providing the infrastructure necessary to support leading edge research at ten national science 
laboratories. The budget request funds the new and ongoing construction projects that will 
address inadequate core infrastructure and utility needs.  
The budget invests $5M for operations of the Artificial Intelligence and Technology 
Office (AITO). AI is a foundational technology that is a key effort for influencing and 
steering decades of innovation. AITO leads Department-wide efforts to evaluate the 
scope and effectiveness of DOE’s AI programs and identify gaps not addressed by 
programs, functional offices, sites, or associated National Laboratories. The DOE AITO 
is uniquely situated to develop and lead collaborative solutions across the Department 
that are consistent with the Administration and Secretary’s priorities and objectives. The 
11 
 
office will also be instrumental in supporting the Administration’s Industries of the 
Future Initiative. 
The budget requests $12.6M for the Office of Technology Transitions to support ongoing 
activities, including the Technology Commercialization Fund, Lab Partnering Service, 
Energy I-Corps, and Innovation XLab summits. The budget request will fully implement the

The FY 2021 budget request includes $215M for Administration and Oversight activities, 
including Departmental Administration (DA), International Affairs, the Inspector 
General, and offsets. 
DA requests $123.5M for management and mission support organizations that have 
enterprise-wide responsibility for administration, accounting, budgeting, contract and 
project management, human resources, congressional and intergovernmental liaison, 
energy policy, information management, life-cycle asset management, legal services, 
workforce diversity and equal employment opportunity, ombudsman services, small 
business advocacy, sustainability, and public affairs.  
In January 2020, the Department began a restructuring of the Office of Policy to the 
Office of Strategic Planning and Policy (OSPP). OSPP will be a direct report to the 
16 
 
Office of the Secretary for a more efficient and effective approach to the analysis, 
formulation, development, and advancement of all policy across the Department.  
The budget requests $33M for International Affairs to coordinate the Department’s 
international work and promote global market opportunities for U.S. energy companies 
and technology exports.  
The Office of the Inspector General is funded at $58M to review the integrity, economy, 
and efficiency of DOE programs and operations, including NNSA and the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). 
The Department will realize -$722M in savings and receipts including from the sale of the 
Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve (-$75M), sale of oil from Strategic Petroleum Reserve    
(-$589M), offsets based on the reduced Title 17 credit subsidy (-$49M) and savings from 
FERC fees and recoveries in excess of annual appropriations (-$9M). 
Achieving goals established in the request requires an exceptional workforce. The 
Department will invest in attracting, training, and retaining the Nation’s best talent. 
Conclusion 
The Department of Energy is focused on the bottom line – delivering real benefit for the 
resources provided by Congress on behalf of the American people. The FY 2021 President’s 
Budget Request provides for America’s future by promoting energy independence, 
progressing scientific research, and protecting the Nation. The budget demonstrates fiscal 
discipline and commitment to an efficient and effective Federal government. To that end, 
DOE will focus spending in areas with the highest return on investment of tax payer dollars. 
The President’s Budget Request supports the critical role the Department of Energy has in 
energy independence and dominance, economic growth, and the safety and security of the 
Nation. Finally, I want to thank the committee for the support for DOE’s mission in FY 2020, 
and your hard work to pass a full year appropriation for FY 2019.  The certainty provided the 
Department is appreciated, and we are seeking that same certainty this year. I look forward to 
working with each of you and your staffs to support and achieve the important Department of 
Energy mission.

STATEMENT OF 
THE HONORABLE ELAINE L. CHAO 
SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION 
BEFORE THE 
APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE ON 
TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING, AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND 
RELATED AGENCIES 
UNITED STATES SENATE 
March 4, 2020 
Introduction 
Chairman Collins, Ranking Member Reed, and members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the President’s Fiscal Year 
(FY) 2021 Budget request for the Department of Transportation.  The President is 
requesting a total of $89 billion to support transportation programs -- an overall 2% 
increase above funds provided in the FY 2020 Appropriations Act.  This funding 
will enable the Department to continue our important work in providing Americans 
with safe and dependable transportation, and will support our progress in 
improving transportation infrastructure throughout the Nation.  
The Department of Transportation’s budget includes a hybrid of different 
kinds of Federal funds.  Typically, about 75 percent of the Department’s Budget 
comes from mandatory authorizations primarily derived from the Highway and 
Aviation Trust Funds, while the remaining 25 percent is funded through 
discretionary appropriations, largely from the General Funds.  Recently, I have 
seen comparisons of the Transportation budget that focus solely on the smaller 
discretionary portion.  By selecting only the discretionary components the budget 
shows a reduction from FY 2020 to FY 2021.  But this is only part of the story.    
When one looks at the whole picture, including Trust Fund programs, the 
President’s FY 2021 Budget request recommends the highest funding for 
transportation investment in our Nation’s history. 
 
1 
 
A New Vision for Surface Transportation  
In a few short months, our current surface transportation authorization – the 
“Fixing America’s Surface Transportation” or FAST Act – will expire.  In 
anticipation of this deadline, I am especially pleased to share that the President’s 
budget includes a total of $1 trillion to rebuild, restore and renew our Nation’s 
infrastructure.  This request includes two parts.  First, the budget envisions a 
historic 10-year authorization for the Department of Transportation’s surface 
transportation programs that will provide $810 billion of predictable funding. The 
President’s request also includes an additional $190 billion for addressing other 
infrastructure improvements including bridge and freight bottlenecks.  
Our plan builds on the foundation of the FAST Act and generally relies on 
the existing program structure for highways and highway safety programs, transit, 
and rail.  After the first year, funding increases are built into the 10-year 
framework at about 4% each year.  No major changes are envisioned to the current 
formula distributions for States and other recipients.   
Our proposal will lay out an authorization that provides more flexibility for 
States and other stakeholders.  It includes program and policy changes that will 
enable us to build modern infrastructure more quickly while ensuring that both 
rural and urban areas receive the assistance they need.  We are also recommending 
significant investments for rebuilding and repairing highways and bridges by using 
flexible grants and modern innovative finance tools that will help us get projects 
moving quickly.  The proposal also includes legislative revisions that will reduce 
the regulatory and administrative burdens that often force communities to wait 
years for the infrastructure improvements they desperately need. 
The Administration’s detailed legislative language is currently under review 
within the Administration.  Once that process is complete and legislation is 
submitted, the Department will be free to discuss its contents in full detail.  In the 
meantime, the President’s budget provides a blueprint summary of the $810 billion 
reauthorization proposal. 
 
Investing in Competitive Infrastructure Programs 
  The President’s Budget demonstrates the Administration’s strong support for 
States and other entities charged with improving or replacing our aging 
transportation infrastructure.  Toward this end, the President’s Budget for DOT 
requests significant resources for several competitive grant programs, including $1 
2 
 
billion for the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (or INFRA) grant program 
and an additional $1 billion for the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage 
Development (or BUILD) grant program.  These programs provide Federal 
assistance for critical projects that will spur progress in both rural and urban 
communities across all modes of surface transportation infrastructure:  highways, 
transit, rail, and ports.  
  With respect to transit, the President’s Budget includes this Administration’s 
largest request ever for the Federal Transit Administration’s Capital Investment 
Grant program:  $1.9 billion.  This request funds the current portfolio of transit 
projects that have signed Full Funding Grant Agreements.  Another $925 million is 
reserved for new projects that may become eligible for Full Funding Grant 
Agreements during FY 2021.  
  
Targeted Investments for the Federal Aviation Administration  
  The President’s Budget recommends $17.5 billion for FAA and includes 
nearly $1 billion across its programs to support the on-going work of NextGen.  
The request is consistent with the FY 2020 Appropriations levels but does not 
propose repeating the new discretionary appropriation for Grants-in-Aid to 
Airports.  Instead, the President’s Budget includes the fully authorized level of 
$3.4 billion to support airport capital improvements.  
  The Budget dedicates $1.5 billion for Aviation Safety -- including an 
increase of $37 million to fund targeted investments to improve FAA’s ability to 
respond to industry innovation, analyze safety trends, and improve accountability.  
Within this amount, funds will be used to establish a centralized Organization 
Designation Authorization office that will coordinate FAA’s work with industry 
manufacturers to certify aircraft safety.  This funding will also help to implement 
recommendations from the ongoing Boeing 737 MAX reviews.   
  FAA continues to be at the forefront in planning for the integration of new 
and emerging technologies into the National Airspace System (NAS).  Toward this 
end, the President’s Budget requests $145 million to further support the integration 
of unmanned aircraft systems (or drones) into the NAS; and, another $44 million to 
support Commercial Space activities.  These programs demonstrate FAA’s 
commitment to encouraging the use of new innovative technologies while at the 
same time ensuring the overall safety of the NAS.  
 
3 
 
Continuing the Recapitalization of the School Ship Fleet 
  Finally, the President’s budget once again includes $300 million for the 
National Security Multi-Mission Vessel replacement program.  This program 
continues the Administration’s efforts to replace the aging School Ship Fleet that 
provides hands-on-training for Midshipmen attending State Maritime Academies.  
These vessels serve a critical role in providing necessary at-sea training for those 
entering the maritime industry that cannot be duplicated in standard classroom 
settings.  
These are some of the key programs included in the President’s FY 2021 
Budget request.  Additional information is included in the Department’s annual 
Budget Highlights document provided for your reference.  Thank you again for the 
opportunity to appear before you today.  I will be happy to answer your questions.

WRITTEN STATEMENT BY 
 
 
 
GENERAL JOSEPH LENGYEL 
CHIEF, NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU 
 
 
 
BEFORE THE 
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON DEFENSE 
 
 
 
SECOND SESSION, 116TH CONGRESS 
ON 
THE NATIONAL GUARD POSTURE HEARING 
 
MARCH 4, 2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NOT FOR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION  
UNTIL RELEASED BY  
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE    
CNGB Executive Summary 
Today’s National Guard plays a vital role in the security and welfare of our nation.  On any 
given day, approximately 30,000 Guardsmen carry out Federal missions around the world, and 
an additional 10,000 Guardsmen conduct State and Federal missions within the United States 
and its territories. National Guardsmen are part of an operational force nearly 450,000 strong 
that provides strategic depth to our nation’s Army and Air Force. 
The National Guard brings unique relationships, authorities, and flexibility to the Joint Force. 
Due to the complex global security environment marked by rapid technological change, these 
attributes are instrumental in implementing the Department of Defense’s (DoD) National 
Defense Strategy (NDS). The National Guard directly supports the three tenets of the NDS: 
building a lethal force ready for any fight, strengthening alliances and seeking new 
partnerships, and reforming to improve performance and affordability. 
The National Guard also represents a tremendous value to the American taxpayer. Personnel 
costs for our citizen-soldiers and citizen-airmen are significantly lower, when not activated, 
than our Active Duty counterparts. We are a force that allows for the rapid expansion of the 
Army and the Air Force. When we are not activated, we offset risk in capacity, allowing for 
modernization and recapitalization that benefits the Active, National Guard, and Reserve 
forces.  We are the primary combat reserve of the Army and Air Force. Furthermore, National 
Guardsmen leverage civilian skill sets in a military capacity, and conversely bring military 
training and knowledge to civilian communities. 
As the Joint Force faces increasing demands in all corners of the globe, and with the ever-
present threat of natural disasters and other unforeseen events taking place within our borders, 
the National Guard supports the NDS and serves the American people at home through three 
core missions: Warfight, Homeland, and Partnerships. 
Warfight 
The warfight is a primary mission and at the heart of everything the National Guard does. Being 
ready to fight and win America’s wars drives our training, our equipment and maintenance 
requirements, and our recruitment efforts.  While we are able to use our training and equipment 
for State missions and DoD mission support, we provide ready forces to Combatant 
Commanders. 
Our current threat environment requires the National Guard to be prepared for complex, 
global operations in the most demanding conditions. With the rise of China and Russia, we 
have shifted our focus from counterinsurgency operations to great power competition. China 
and Russia are undermining the international order through various means, exploiting all 
domains to change the character of warfare. We remain poised to surge to augment the Joint 
Force for national security threats from Iran, North Korea, and non-state violent extremists. 
The changing and global nature of threats shapes the warfight, and the National Guard is 
evolving rapidly to meet new demands.  We are the principal combat reserve of the Army and 
Air Force, making up 20 percent of the entire Joint Force providing strategic depth in support 
of combatant commands. Since 9/11, more than a million Guardsmen have mobilized and 
deployed; many have deployed multiple times. While the model of one weekend a month and 
two weeks a year provides the foundation of readiness across the National Guard, dynamic 
1 
 
employment and global operations will require more of our service members than ever 
before. In order to fully leverage readiness that lives in the National Guard and to empower 
our Guard men and women, mobilization requirements need to be predictable.  This structure, 
predictable in time but geographically agile, will afford the DoD greater flexibility during this 
period of great power competition. 
This flexibility in employment also requires an enterprise approach to modernization of the 
Total Force in order to remain deployable, sustainable, and interoperable with the Active 
Components. The Guard requires parity in our training, facilities and equipment.  There is 
only one standard for readiness, and there should be only the highest standard for our 
equipment. Without parity, we cannot integrate with the Active Components; if we cannot 
integrate, we cannot be the lethal force necessary to help deter, fight, and win America’s 
wars. Training, facilities, and equipment must strive for parity to keep our Guardsmen 
interoperable and our country competitive. 
A prime example of a Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 action that supports National Guard parity is the 
arrival of F-35s to the Vermont Air National Guard. The presence of this cutting edge 
capability within the National Guard demonstrates a new commitment to the recapitalization 
and modernization necessary to ensure Guard readiness and interoperability. 
Homeland 
The National Guard serves a dual State and Federal role within our borders. Guardsmen can be 
found in nearly every county of the United States, and this proximity allows us to respond 
quickly to any threat that endangers our homeland. Our skills, developed for and honed through 
the warfight, can play an important part in a unified response during domestic emergencies, and 
allow Guardsmen to assist first responders in times of crises. 
The United States strives to never let the fight reach our borders. However, the reality of today’s 
security environment makes clear our homeland is no longer a sanctuary. Cyber threats and new 
weapons’ technology extend the reach of our adversaries. 
National Guard Missile Defenders in places such as Fort Greely, Alaska, Schriever Air Force 
Base, Colorado, and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, protect our homeland and stand 
ready to support DoD’s efforts to adapt to the challenge of advancing missile threats that can 
reach our shores. The National Guard plays a critical role in our DoD’s cyber enterprise and 
are a valuable resource to the States. More than 3,900 Soldiers and Airmen make up the 
Guard’s cyber force. On a routine basis, these professionals directly support the U.S. Cyber 
Command’s Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) construct. Additionally, our National Guard cyber 
teams, at the direction of their States, used their expertise to respond to ransomware attacks in 
Texas, Louisiana, California, Colorado, and Montana. 
National Guard cyber support to State and local municipalities in 2019 are an indication of 
the future cyber environment; and our actions demonstrate both the effectiveness and value 
of the Guard’s cyber capabilities. 
The National Guard is often at its most visible in American communities in the aftermath of 
natural disasters, and 2019 was no exception. The National Guard responded to snowstorms, 
wildfires, and floods, and provided full-spectrum recovery and support to all those affected 
by Hurricane Dorian. Our collaboration with State, local, and Federal (including military) 
2 
 
entities helps the National Guard respond quickly and effectively in times of disaster. In 
addition, we are constantly training and are ready to respond to incidents in the homeland, 
whether natural or man-made.  We are America’s military first responders in times of 
disaster. 
The National Guard also provides support to civilian law enforcement agencies through DoD’s 
National Guard Counterdrug Program. Through this program, the National Guard has provided 
support to more than 300 Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial civilian law enforcement 
agencies across all 54 states and territories for more than 30 years. While Guardsmen do not 
conduct law enforcement missions, they provide expertise such as analysis support, 
communications, and linguist services to law enforcement entities. This helps law enforcement 
combat cartels, positively reach at-risk youth, and seize billions of dollars in illegal narcotics. 
This program is another way the National Guard is making a difference in the homeland. 
Partnerships 
The National Guard is unique in the depth and breadth of its relationships. Whether its security 
cooperation activities with international partners or emergency response coordination with 
State and local governments, or collaborating within the federal interagency process, these 
relationships strengthen alliances and partnerships. 
Partnerships are vital to our military strength and success. Every day, our allies and partners 
join us in deterring war and preserving a free and open international order. By working together 
with our allies and partners, we share the burdens and responsibility for our common defense. 
These relationships also offer unique perspectives and positions that help us understand and 
access critical regions of the globe. 
When building alliances with foreign nations, the National Guard’s State Partnership Program 
(SPP) is one of the premier security cooperation initiatives within DoD. The SPP is a scalable 
and tailored approach to security cooperation that formally links a state’s National Guard with 
the armed forces of a partner country. The National Guard consults and coordinates with 
combatant commanders, U.S. Embassies and their country teams, and host nations to 
understand the full range of issues they face. SPP events are led by respective state adjutants 
general who seek engagements on a broad array of interests that are beneficial to both nations. 
Today, 84 countries around the world are partnered with the National Guard through this 
program.  Through the SPP, we do more than conduct military-to-military engagements; we 
leverage whole-of-society relationships and capabilities. These partnerships also help us 
counter malign influence, support combat and security operations deployments, and assist with 
disaster response. Given the benefits of this program, consistent funding is critical to the 
continued success of the SPP, and the long-term advancements of our national security 
interests. 
Owing to our role as State-controlled militias, the National Guard inherently has close 
relationships with state and local agencies and officials.  Our skills and abilities developed for 
the warfight—including manpower, training, leadership, organization, logistics and 
communications—augment Governors’ and community partners’ emergency response 
strategies, ultimately responding to the needs of Americans in the homeland. 
 
3 
 
Three Priorities for the Future of the Guard 
Today’s National Guard is the finest in its history. However, we must not become complacent 
and must continue to evolve for the threats ahead. We will be responsive to global trends and 
prepare for the challenges of the future by committing to three priorities: readiness, people, 
and innovation. 
Priority #1: Readiness 
Guard Soldiers and Airmen support DoD missions across every geographic combatant 
command and respond to disasters in communities across the nation. As an operational force, 
we provide strategic depth to the Army and Air Force. We must remain interoperable in light of 
increasing global demands, train and equip our Guardsmen, and maintain our facilities to this 
standard. 
The National Guard needs functional facilities to accomplish critical domestic response and 
warfight missions.  We cannot be ready for the challenges of the future with yesterday’s training, 
equipment, or facilities. Like the need for cutting edge equipment, our Soldiers and Airmen 
deserve the best facilities while serving our communities or preparing for overseas operations. 
The Army National Guard (ARNG) is committed to generating forces that are both 
warfighting- capable and governor-responsive. Combatant Commanders depend upon ARNG 
Soldiers during every phase of conflict abroad and governors depend upon them during 
emergencies at home. 
In FY 2019, the ARNG contributed to missions in Afghanistan, Kuwait, Jordan, Qatar, 
Ukraine, Kosovo, Eastern Europe, the Horn of Africa and the Sinai Peninsula. ARNG units 
also conducted vital, multinational exercises and performed more than 2 million duty days 
while assisting communities during devastating hurricanes, floods, winter storms and 
wildfires. 
In its Federal role, the ARNG’s primary task is to generate combat-ready forces for the U.S. 
Army and the Joint Force. The Army designates select ARNG formations as Army Response 
Forces (ARF) that are available to rapidly deploy and conduct contingency operations. 
Additionally, four ARNG brigade combat teams and enablers will complete decisive-action 
training rotations at the Army’s premier combat training centers. The ARNG’s primary focus in 
FY 2020 is to sustain gains in recruiting and address challenges in retention that threaten 
readiness. All of these activities will be overlaid with deployments and exercises for tens of 
thousands of our Citizen-Soldiers around the world. 
Given this level of activity, ARNG leaders are managing the cumulative impacts of training and 
operations to ensure we keep faith with Families and civilian employers. Doing so is essential to 
support the people who underwrite our Soldiers’ service year after year. 
 
The Air National Guard (ANG) commitment to readiness provides our nation and Air Force 
with significant flexibility. After more than two decades as a proven operational force, the 
ANG has become a critical component to the nation’s strategic deterrence, operational 
capability, and first-in capability. Furthermore, the ANG possesses strategic capacity across 
each of the Air Force Core Competencies: Air and Space Superiority; Intelligence, 
4 
 
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Rapid Global Mobility; Global Strike; and Command and 
Control. 
In FY 2019, the men and women of the Air National Guard supported 14,692 deployments to 
52 countries and on any given day, there are more than 5,000 Guard Airmen serving around the 
world in support of the combatant commands. 
The Air National Guard’s focus on readiness assures dominance in air, space, and cyberspace. 
We do so by preparing 21st century Air Guardsmen for today’s fight, while building for 
tomorrow’s fight.  Our objective is to provide our nation with an operational and lethal force 
with rapid response capability, which is fully interoperable with the United States Air Force and 
the Joint Force, and able to deter aggressors and defeat threats to our national interest. 
In addition, the National Guard remains a valued and loyal partner to our national security 
space enterprise. Our National Guard space units ensure we dominate that domain as it gains 
prominence in warfare. Since the United States Space Force was formally established by the 
December 20, 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, the National Guard has supported and 
will continue to support the newest military service.  Specifically, the National Guard supplies 
the Department of Defense 100 percent of its unit-equipped, surge-to-war operational reserve 
component space force structure. To date, the National Guard provides 40 percent of the 
operational expeditionary space electronic warfare capabilities in the Space Force, and is 
rapidly growing to 60 percent with the addition of two squadrons in Guam and Hawaii. 
Furthermore, the National Guard retains decades of space-related depth and expertise. For 
example, every day the space professionals at Clear Air Force Station Alaska monitor missile 
threats in the Pacific, and National Guard space intelligence experts in Ohio monitor space 
threats.  Most recently, space electronic warfare units from California and Florida returned from 
overseas deployments that were critical to combatant command success. For the future success 
of our newest service, it is vital the National Guard’s expertise and capabilities continue to be 
available to the Space Force enterprise. 
Readiness requires that our leaders remain focused on the mission and empower our men 
and women to reach our objectives. 
Priority #2: People, Families, and Employers 
No one who puts on a uniform serves alone. This is particularly true in the National Guard, 
where our Guardsmen balance service with civilian careers. We strive to balance the needs of 
both our drilling and full-time Guardsmen with the demands of the mission, and provide 
support to the families of our service men and women. 
Our Guardsmen come from communities all across the country, bringing with them diverse 
cultures, experiences, and skills. Our National Guard culture values diversity and inclusion, 
which are fundamental to organizational readiness and help us reach and maintain the 
highest standards. We are at our best when we reflect the communities we serve. 
To build for the future, we must recruit people with the right skills and experience. That is why 
focusing on active duty service members who are transitioning to civilian life is a critical piece 
to our recruitment.  We want to ensure we capture the talent and skills of these service members 
and show them the benefits of continued service to their country. We must recruit the very best 
men and women, therefore we must also have competitive incentives—such as education 
5 
 
benefits.  We must share our story, our history, our legacy. 
We also have a responsibility to support the Guardsmen in our ranks. We are emphasizing 
mental health and resilience for our Soldiers and Airmen through the Suicide Prevention and 
Readiness Initiative, which helps Guard units identify risk factors and effective intervention 
techniques. Through the Warrior Resilience and Fitness Innovation Incubator, the National 
Guard is also taking a grassroots approach to find ways to address mental health crises at a 
local level. 
To support our Guard members’ families, we provide family readiness programs, employment 
assistance programs, and ensure that families know where to turn if they need help. Family 
programs not only benefit service members and their families, but also have a positive effect 
on a unit’s morale and readiness. 
#3 Innovation 
We have a responsibility to improve the National Guard—to leave it better than we found it, 
so we can be ready for the challenges of the future. Innovation—whether in business 
processes, technology, partnerships, or culture—is in our DNA. We must constantly look 
forward, educating and empowering our Guardsmen to implement innovative measures. 
Technology has radically shaped our lives, and it has radically reshaped our national defense. 
Success no longer goes to the country that develops a new technology first—it goes to the 
country that adapts its way of fighting fastest. The National Guard continues to be a catalyst for 
DoD’s technological initiatives, including artificial intelligence, robotics, biotechnology, “big 
data,” and advanced computing. 
Conclusion 
The National Guard traces its lineage back 383 years. In that time, we have fought in every 
American war, responded to our countrymen in need, and developed partnerships that have 
strengthened our national defense. However, we are just getting started. With the incredible 
skills and talents of our men and women, we are ready for today and building for the future. 
We will undoubtedly face new challenges, but our values, our vision, and our willingness to 
fight and secure our nation runs deep. Today and tomorrow, the National Guard is Always 
Ready, Always There.

STATEMENT OF DAVID BERNHARDT 
SECRETARY OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR 
BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON  
INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES 
SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
ON THE PRESIDENT’S 2021 BUDGET REQUEST 
MARCH 4, 2020 
 
 
 
Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Udall, and Members of the Subcommittee, I am here 
today to discuss the President’s Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Request for the Department of the 
Interior.  
 
Let me begin by thanking the Committee for working with me last year on a number of key 
issues.  I appreciate the fact that respectful disagreements of policy have not gotten in the way of 
our efforts to put in place successful reform of the Department’s Freedom of Information Act 
program; a strengthened and expanded Ethics Program to guide employees and promote a culture 
of ethical compliance and a workplace free from harassment; and the relocation of the Bureau of 
Land Management’s Headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado, a reform that will better align 
BLM’s functions with available resources.  
 
The Fiscal Year 2021 Budget 
 
The Department of the Interior’s mission directly affects Americans across the country. 
Delivering the Department’s mission creates economic benefits for the Nation through both 
direct investment and facilitating private-sector activities and contributions.  According to the 
Department’s current Economic Report, in 2018, lands under the Department’s jurisdiction 
generated roughly $315 billion in total economic output across the country.  The Department 
also grants access to public lands and offshore areas for conventional and renewable energy 
development.  In FY 2018, Departmental lands and waters produced nearly one-fifth of the 
Nation’s energy, generating roughly $150 billion in economic output, which included $7.9 
billion in direct energy revenue disbursements to States and the Treasury.  
 
President Trump has been clear in his direction and priorities, setting ambitious goals 
challenging federal agencies—through governmentwide Executive Orders (EOs) and Presidential 
memoranda— to deliver better results.  The Department has worked consistently to implement 
the President’s agenda for the Department.  Investments outlined in the President’s 2021 budget 
will allow the Department to advance the objectives articulated in Presidential directives.  
 
The 2021 budget advances key Presidential priorities, including the Department’s new Plan to 
Transform the Firefighting Workforce, investments in active forest and rangeland management 
to better protect communities from fire, increased access to broadband in rural areas, 
advancement of critical minerals exploration and development, and provision of law enforcement 
1 
 
needs in tribal communities. While investing in key areas, this budget also supports the 
Administration’s broader fiscal objectives through targeted reforms and program reductions.  
 
In 2021, the Department will continue to make important operational reforms—revisiting 
outdated and redundant processes and regulations, strengthening the Department’s ethical 
culture, and transforming internal administrative operations to deliver better service to customers 
and employees. 
 
The 2021 budget for the Department totals $12.8 billion in current authority.  The Department 
continues to have access to additional emergency suppression resources via the wildfire cap 
adjustment in the event of a severe wildland fire season.  The Department estimates there will be 
an additional $7.5 billion in permanent authority available—including grants and payments—for 
specific activities that do not require annual appropriation. 
 
The 2021 budget continues to prioritize taking care of the lands and resources we oversee, 
expanding access to those areas for public recreation and enjoyment, and investing to improve 
the visitor experience at our sites.  Funding focuses on delivering our direct mission activities. In 
2021, we are proposing several targeted investments to advance specific objectives and deliver 
tangible results, which include the following: 
 
  Bolstering the Department’s capability to address the wildfire seasons. 
  Investing in proactive forest and fuels management activities to reduce wildfire risk. 
  Supporting a broadband access initiative to expand coverage in rural and tribal areas. 
  Proposing a more sustainable Wild Horse and Burro management strategy. 
  Investing in U.S. energy security and ensuring a reliable supply of critical minerals.  
  Expanding public access to the Department’s lands for hunting, fishing, and other 
outdoor recreation. 
  Addressing the problem of missing and murdered indigenous people in Indian Country. 
  Promoting conservation stewardship focused on recovery and promoting collaborative

“Examining the President’s FY 2021 Budget Request for the 
Transportation Security Administration”

Good morning Chairman Capito, Ranking Member Tester, and distinguished members of 
the subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me to testify on the President’s FY 2021 Budget 
Request, which includes an $8.24 billion request for the Transportation Security Administration 
(TSA). I am honored to be here and grateful for the longstanding and constructive relationship 
that TSA enjoys with this subcommittee.  
TSA was established by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) in the wake 
of the September 11th attacks. The world has changed since then, but our fundamental mission, to 
protect the nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and 
commerce, has not. While we remain steadfast in providing the highest level of security for the 
U.S. across all modes of transportation, the scope and complexity of that goal has increased over 
the last two decades. Today, the U.S. transportation systems accommodate approximately 965 
million domestic and international aviation passengers per year; over 5.3 billion passengers 
traveling on both transit and over-the-road buses each year; more than 10.1 billion passenger 
trips on mass transit per year; 26 million students daily on school buses; and nearly 900,000 
chemical shipments every day on trucks. Our interconnected transportation system and 
infrastructure includes approximately 440 federalized airports; 126,000 miles of railroad tracks; 
4.2 million miles of highway; 615,000 highway bridges; 473 road tunnels; and 2.5 million miles 
of pipeline.  
Since TSA’s creation, the modes and methods of terrorist attacks have become more 
decentralized and opportunistic than ever before. Aviation and transport hubs, however, remain 
highly-valued targets. Our adversaries are watching us, studying our vulnerabilities, and working 
hard to formulate new attack strategies to replace those that have failed. The daily threat 
environment TSA faces in the aviation, surface, and cyber security realms is persistent, 
2 
 
pervasive, and constantly evolving. To meet the challenge created by such adversaries, we must 
innovate, deploy new solutions rapidly and effectively, and maximize the impact of our 
resources. 
Our continuing vision is to be an agile security agency, embodied by a professional 
workforce that engages its partners and the American people to outmatch a dynamic threat. To 
that end, in April 2018, I issued the 2018-2026 TSA Strategy, which established three strategic 
priorities to guide the agency’s workforce through its 25th Anniversary: Improve Security and 
Safeguard the Transportation System; Accelerate Action; and Commit to Our People. I 
subsequently published my Administrator’s Intent delineating short and medium-term objectives 
for the first three years to achieve those priorities.  
Further empowering TSA to execute its mission, serve as a global leader in 
transportation, and become an employer of choice, the TSA Modernization Act of 2018, the 
agency’s first comprehensive reauthorization since inception, was enacted in October 2018. The 
TSA Modernization Act authorized funding for Fiscal Years 2019, 2020, and 2021; enhanced 
organizational structures, operations, and processes; and established a five-year term for the 
Administrator – a critically important factor for ensuring organizational stability and setting and 
achieving longer term agency goals.  
As I come before you today, slightly more than halfway through my term as 
Administrator and at a point where we are developing the next version of the Administrator’s 
Intent, I want to thank Congress for the authorities provided to TSA through the TSA 
Modernization Act.  Currently, TSA has completed more than 80 percent of the Act’s 
requirements with deadlines and I want to express my gratitude for the previous appropriations 
provided to TSA that have enabled us to execute our mission and make significant progress on a 
3 
 
number of strategic priorities.  Additionally, I want to use this opportunity to convey both what 
we have accomplished and our future goals and objectives. In FY 2019, we –  
  Screened approximately 839 million aviation passengers (with a peak volume of 2.8 
million passengers in one day), representing a 4.3 percent checkpoint volume increase from 
FY 2018; 
  Screened 1.9 billion carry-on items and more than 510 million checked bags;  
  Procured 300 Computed Tomography (CT) units and began preparation for the nationwide 
deployment of CT systems; and  
  Conducted 1,693 air carrier inspections at foreign airports, 144 foreign airport assessments, 
60 pipeline critical facility security reviews, 107 assessments of mass transit operator 
security enhancements, and 182 assessments of security enhancements by motor carriers.  
The FY 2021 President’s Budget continues to support TSA’s strategy to improve security 
and safeguard the Nation’s transportation system, accelerate action, and reinforce TSA’s 
commitment to its people. It supports $3.5 billion for our Transportation Security Officers 
(TSOs) at the Nation’s airports. We thank Congress for the continued support you’ve provided 
for the TSO staffing increases needed to meet passenger expectations as well as increasing 
volumes. This investment will allow us to maintain acceptable wait times, and mitigate risk 
associated with crowding at checkpoints.  
To complement a well-trained, sufficiently sized workforce, TSA is also focused on 
strengthening checkpoint operations through the development and acquisition of new 
technology. To this end, we are in the process of acquiring Computed Tomography (CT) units 
and Credential Authentication Technology (CAT) units, which represent significant technologic 
enhancements from the equipment currently used for identity verification and the screening of 
4 
 
accessible property, and deploying them to airports nationwide as quickly as possible. CT 
technology will provide superior detection capability, will be more convenient for passengers, 
and eventually may eliminate the requirement to take electronics, liquids, aerosols, and gels out 
of carry-on bags.  
As of February 25, 2020, there are 65 CT units deployed to checkpoints with another 49 
units supporting testing and research and development. The FY 2021 President’s Budget 
provides $28.9 million to support the procurement of 30 full-size CT units. The FY 2021 funding 
will enable TSA to continue to accelerate the provision of CT technology to the field to enable 
our workforce to more effectively and efficiently execute the mission.  
CAT also provides a significant security upgrade to the identification verification and 
prescreening process. Ultimately, CAT will enable Secure Flight screening status to be known 
and cross-checked in near real time. In FY 2019, TSA procured 505 CAT units, with 480 units 
deployed as of February 10, 2020. The FY 2021 President’s Budget includes $2.3 million to 
finalize the procurement and deployment of 1,520 CAT units to airports nationwide. The 
continued rollout of CAT units to checkpoints will improve TSA’s ability to detect fraudulent 
documents and screen passengers based on assessed risk. The CAT unit has also served as a key 
tool for TSA’s efforts to meet the TSA Modernization Act requirement for TSA Pre✓® lanes to 
only serve passengers with Known Traveler Numbers, which will improve the TSA Pre✓® 
passenger experience, and serve as a platform for testing voluntary facial matching technology.  
Finally, TSA strives through continued investment to improve the Advanced Imaging 
Technology (AIT) being used at our checkpoints today. The FY 2021 President’s Budget 
provides $5 million to develop Next Gen AIT systems, and an additional $3 million of funding 
for research and development enhancements for Emerging Alarm Resolution technologies.  
5 
 
 Our frontline workforce can better execute their security mission when equipped with 
the technology needed to counter evolving threats. While sustained technological improvement 
at our checkpoints is critically important, we are also committed to investing in our most 
important asset, our people. TSA is pleased that our employees provide input into the Federal 
Employee Viewpoint Survey, values their feedback, and acknowledges the concerns regarding 
pay dissatisfaction and low morale expressed through the survey. In an effort to address these 
longstanding workforce challenges, I commissioned a Blue-Ribbon Panel of public and private 
sector human capital experts last year to identify problems and recommend solutions. In 2019, 
we received a number of recommendations from the panel, including that TSA should better 
leverage the authorities and flexibilities provided through ATSA rather than convert to the 
General Schedule.  
Recently, TSA has addressed locality driven turnover issues through the use of retention 
incentives as a short-term fix for retaining TSOs in particularly competitive markets. 
Concurrently, we took measures to create career paths that aligned increased pay to enhanced 
training and skills by implementing the TSO Career Progression initiative. Through the FY 2021 
President’s Budget, TSA is transitioning away from relying predominantly on employing 
retention incentives at specific locations and instead adopting a more holistic and permanent 
solution by investing in career service pay, which will create a more predictable system for 
salary increases over a TSO’s career. Additionally, the FY 2021 Budget supports the 
implementation of a second phase of our TSO Career Progression initiative, a merit based 
promotion to 7,500 top performing TSOs.  
The FY 2021 President’s Budget funds two workforce initiatives and represents a 
significant long-term commitment to our workforce that will help address these concerns. First, 
6 
 
the Budget includes $23.6 million for Service Pay to fund predictable, annual pay increases for 
TSOs who demonstrate service experience. The Budget also seeks $11.3 million for the second 
phase of TSO Career Progression, an investment that will enable TSA to provide a three percent 
pay increase to screeners who demonstrate higher skill levels in checkpoint operations. Although 
TSA has the legal authority to implement these workforce improvements, TSA requires the 
budgetary resources to provide these additional workforce improvements to TSOs. We are 
confident that the investment in Service Pay and funding of the second phase of the TSO Career 
Progression initiative demonstrate how we can employ our ATSA authorities to make TSA an 
employer of choice.  
Finally, in conjunction with the FY 2021 President’s Budget, the Administration has 
proposed raising the Aviation Passenger Security Fee, also known as the September 11th Security 
Fee, in order to fully cover the costs of aviation security by FY 2028. The fee was created to 
cover the costs of aviation security, but in FY 2020 only covers 39 percent of today’s costs. The 
proposal would increase the fee by one dollar, from $5.60 to $6.60 per one-way trip in FY 2021 
and from $6.60 to $8.25 in FY 2022. This measure would generate $618 million in new revenue 
in FY 2021 and close to $28 billion in new revenue over the next 10 years.  
Securing our Nation’s transportation system is a complex task and we cannot do it alone. 
To achieve the priorities reflected within the FY 2021 President’s Budget, we will continue to 
engage with industry and stakeholders, invest resources in our employees, and encourage the 
public to be part of the solution. Finally, through constructive oversight and dialogue, we seek to 
partner with Congress as we work to secure all modes of transportation.  
Chairman Capito, Ranking Member Tester, and members of the Subcommittee, thank 
you for the opportunity to testify before you today. I look forward to your questions.

Sec. Azar Written Budget Testimony 
 
The President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Budget (Budget) is built around a vision for HHS and a 
vision for American healthcare. We are building toward a future where HHS’s programs work 
better for the people we serve; where America’s healthcare system is affordable, personalized, 
and puts patients in control; and where our human services programs put people at the center. 
 
The Budget reflects the Administration’s commitments to delivering on this vision and other 
important themes of HHS’s work: advancing a patient-centered healthcare system, protecting the 
lives of the American people, promoting independence, and making HHS the healthiest 
organization it can be. 
 
Over the past year, under President Trump’s leadership, the men and women of HHS have 
delivered remarkable results. Beginning in 2018 and through 2019, the number of drug overdose 
deaths in America began to decline for the first time in nearly two decades, thanks to huge 
expansions, assisted by HHS, in access to evidence-based addiction treatment. The Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) approved a record number of generic drugs and biosimilars in FY 
2019. We launched new payment models in Medicare that pay for health and outcomes, rather 
than sickness and procedures. We finalized a requirement, effective January 2021, that hospitals 
provide patients with useful price information, and proposed measures to give patients control 
over their own health data through interoperability. We launched President Trump’s initiative to 
end the HIV epidemic in America within ten years, and worked with Congress to secure funding 
for it. The Department played a vital role in responding to an Ebola outbreak in the eastern 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and the humanitarian crisis in Latin America. We took 
unprecedented steps to expand access to treatment for Americans with serious mental illness and 
worked to help seniors remain in their homes. The latest data from the Administration for 
Children and Families shows a record number of adoptions with child-welfare-agency 
involvement, and reductions in the number of children entering foster care.  The Budget proposes 
to continue work on these priorities, while also identifying new areas for action, such as maternal 
and rural health. 
 
The Budget proposes $94.5 billion in discretionary budget authority and $1.3 trillion in 
mandatory funding. Within our discretionary programs, it prioritizes funding for programs that 
have demonstrated effectiveness, proposes to end programs that have not, and focuses on direct 
services provided to the American people. On mandatory spending, the Budget proposes 
commonsense reforms that will pave a path to fiscal sustainability and make these important 
programs work better for the people they serve. 
 
FACILITATE PATIENT-CENTERED CARE 
 
Providing Price and Quality Transparency 
President Trump’s Executive Order on Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American 
Healthcare to Put Patients First directs HHS to make healthcare prices transparent, laying the 
foundation for a patient-driven and value-based health system.  HHS has acted swiftly to require 
hospitals to publish the prices they negotiate with insurers and is working to do the same for 
issuers, so patients can understand their own out-of-pocket costs.  CMS has also required Part D 
  1  Putting America’s Health First 
prescription drug plans to develop tools that allow beneficiaries to determine plan benefits and 
formularies.   
 
The Executive Order calls for the development of a Health Quality Roadmap that aligns and 
improves reporting on data and quality measures across Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s 
Health Insurance Program, and other Federal health programs.  The Roadmap will include a 
strategy for establishing, adopting, and publishing common quality measures; aligning hospital 
inpatient and hospital outpatient measures; and eliminating low-value or counterproductive 
measures. 
 
HHS legislative proposals increase price and quality transparency in Medicare.  For instance, the 
Budget would eliminate coinsurance or copayments for a screening colonoscopy when a polyp is 
found, saving lives and supporting the President’s policy to reduce out-of-pocket costs for this 
common procedure. 
 
The Budget also invests funding in programs that promote transparency.  The Budget requests 
$51 million for the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, which includes funding to 
develop, promote, and adopt common standards to integrate health information and product 
transparency while protecting privacy.  In addition, the new National Institute for Research on 
Safety and Quality within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports the Administration’s 
efforts to move healthcare organizations from volume to value by focusing on improving 
outcomes, reducing cost, and expanding choices for consumers.  Research investments will focus 
on developing knowledge, tools, and data needed to improve the healthcare system.   
 
Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs   
The United States is first in the world in biopharmaceutical investment and innovation.  But too 
often, this system has not put American patients first.  We have access to the greatest medicines 
in the world, but access is meaningless without affordability.  The Budget supports quick 
Congressional action to pass comprehensive legislation to address these flaws in our current drug 
pricing system and provide needed relief to the American people.   
 
The Budget delivers on President Trump’s promise to bring down the high cost of drugs and 
reduce out-of-pocket costs for American consumers by pursuing policies that align with the four 
pillars of the President’s American Patients First Blueprint:  increased competition, better 
negotiation, incentives for lower list prices, and lowering out-of-pocket costs. 
 
The Budget includes an allowance for bipartisan drug pricing proposals.  The Administration 
supports legislative efforts to improve the Medicare Part D benefit by establishing an out-of-
pocket maximum and reducing out-of-pocket costs for seniors.  The Administration also supports 
changes to bring lower cost generic and biosimilar drugs to patients.  These efforts would 
increase competition, reduce drug prices, and lower out of pocket costs for patients at the 
pharmacy counter. 
 
The Budget includes an allowance for savings of $135 billion over ten years to support the 
President’s commitment to lower the cost of prescription drugs. 
 
  2  Putting America’s Health First 
Protecting and Improving Medicare for our Nation’s Seniors 
Over 60 million American seniors are in the Medicare program, and they are overwhelmingly 
satisfied with the care they receive through traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage.  The 
President is continuing to strengthen and improve these programs.   
 
The Budget continues to implement the President’s Executive Order on Protecting and 
Improving Medicare for Our Nation’s Seniors, building on those aspects of the program that 
work well, while also introducing market-based approaches to Medicare reimbursement.  The 
Administration seeks to protect and reform Medicare with proposals that strengthen fiscal 
sustainability and deliver value to patients.  To drive reform, the Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services (CMS) is modernizing the Medicare Advantage program, unleashing 
innovation, expanding telehealth options, and driving competition to improve quality among 
private Medicare health and drug plans.  The Administration is expanding flexibility for these 
Medicare Advantage plans to maximize choices for seniors, and taking action to ensure fee-for-
service Medicare is not promoted over Medicare Advantage. 
 
President’s Health Reform Vision Allowance 
While Americans have the best healthcare options in the world, rising healthcare costs continue 
to be a top financial concern for many Americans.  President Trump’s Health Reform Vision will 
protect the most vulnerable, especially those with pre-existing conditions, and provide the 
affordability, choice, and control Americans want and the high-quality care that all Americans 
deserve. 
  
The President’s Health Reform Vision would build on efforts outlined in the Executive Order, 
“Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare To Put Patients First” to 
provide greater transparency of healthcare costs and enshrine the right of a patient to know the 
cost of care before it is delivered.  It focuses on lowering the price of medicine, ending surprise 
medical bills, breaking down barriers to choice and competition, and reducing unnecessary 
regulatory burdens.  The Health Reform Vision will also prioritize Federal resources for the most 
vulnerable and provide assistance for low-income individuals.  Medicaid reform will restore 
balance, flexibility, integrity, and accountability to the state-federal partnership.  Medicaid 
spending will grow at a more sustainable rate by ending the financial bias that currently favors 
able-bodied working-age adults over the truly vulnerable. 
 
The Budget includes savings of $844 billion over ten years for the President’s Health Reform 
Vision Allowance. 
 
Paying for Outcomes 
The Administration is committed to advancing a personalized and affordable healthcare system 
that puts the patient at the center by ensuring Federal health programs produce quality outcomes 
and results at the lowest possible cost.   
 
In part, this will be achieved by our continued focus on paying for outcomes rather than 
procedures.  For instance, the Budget seeks to improve Medicare primary care services by 
ensuring payments more accurately reflect clinician time, resources, and outcomes.  The Budget 
also implements a value-based purchasing program for hospital outpatient departments, 
  3  Putting America’s Health First 
ambulatory surgical centers, and post-acute care facilities, offering incentives to improve quality 
and health outcomes.  Finally, the Budget proposes a set of reforms that improve the physician 
experience and participation in the Quality Payment Program by eliminating reporting burdens 
for clinicians participating in the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System, CMS’s largest value-
based care payment program.   
 
The Administration issued proposed rules to   modernize key regulations that advance the 
movement to value-based care and paying for outcomes.  Specifically, the Administration 
proposed reforms to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Physician Self-Referral regulations (Stark 
Law), and 42 CFR Part 2.  These proposed rules are part of HHS’s Regulatory Sprint to 
Coordinated Care, which aims to reduce regulatory barriers and accelerate the transformation of 
the healthcare system into one that better pays for value and promotes care coordination.  These 
proposed rules reduce unnecessary regulatory burden on physicians and other healthcare 
providers while reinforcing their statutory intents of protecting patients from unnecessary 
services, and limiting fraud waste and abuse.  This includes adding flexibilities with respect to 
outcomes-based payments and part-time arrangements.  These rules would allow physicians and 
other healthcare providers and suppliers to design and enter into value-based arrangements that 
improve quality outcomes, produce health system efficiencies, and lower costs. 
 
The CMS Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center) launched a number 
of innovative payment and service delivery models to test ideas to shift our healthcare system 
toward payment for outcomes and health rather than sickness and procedures.  This effort 
includes Direct Contracting and Primary Care First, a new suite of payment model options that 
will transform primary care to deliver better value for patients throughout the healthcare system.  
In addition, the Emergency Triage, Treat, and Transport Model provides greater flexibility to 
ambulance care teams to address emergency healthcare needs of Medicare beneficiaries 
following a 911 call, rather than delivering them to the hospital or emergency department for an 
unnecessary and expensive visit. 
 
PROTECT LIFE AND LIVES 
 
Combating the Opioid and Methamphetamine Crisis 
In 2018, drug overdose deaths declined for the first time since 1990.  A reduction in deaths from 
prescription opioid painkillers is almost entirely responsible for this decline.  To maintain and 
build on this progress, HHS continues to advance the department’s five-point strategy to: 
  Improve access to prevention, treatment, and recovery services, including the full range 
of medication-assisted treatments;  
  Better target the availability of overdose-reversing drugs;  
  Strengthen our understanding of the crisis through better public health data and reporting;  
  Provide support for cutting edge research on pain and addiction; and  
  Improve pain management practices. 
 
The Budget requests $5.2 billion to address the opioid overdose epidemic and methamphetamine 
use, including $169 million in new resources.  Funding expands State Opioid Response grants in 
the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to provide 
treatment, recovery support services, and relapse prevention.  The Budget provides funding to 
  4  Putting America’s Health First 
the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for Addiction Medicine Fellowships 
to support approximately 60 fellows annually in underserved, community-based settings that 
integrate primary care with mental health and substance use disorder prevention and treatment 
services.   
 
While opioids have been at the forefront of the drug landscape, the crisis continues to evolve and 
many public health experts believe we are entering into the fourth wave of the crisis, which is 
underscored by increases in overdose deaths involving cocaine and methamphetamine.   
 
HHS is leveraging current efforts to address the opioid epidemic to combat the rising mortality 
and morbidity associated with methamphetamines and other stimulants.  To allow flexibility to 
most effectively combat substance use in whatever form it takes, SAMHSA’s State Opioid 
Response grant program has the flexibility to also address stimulants.  HHS would direct 
$50 million within NIH for research to develop medication-assisted treatment and evidence-
based psychosocial treatment for methamphetamines and other stimulants.   
 
Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America 
In the 2019 State of the Union, President Trump announced a bold new initiative to reduce new 
HIV infections by 75 percent in the next 5 years and by 90 percent in the next 10 years, averting 
more than 400,000 HIV infections in that time period.  This initiative focuses on four key 
strategies: 
  Diagnose all individuals with HIV as early as possible after infection;  
  Treat the infection rapidly and effectively after diagnosis, achieving sustained viral 
suppression; 
  Protect individuals at risk for HIV using proven prevention approaches; and  
  Respond rapidly to detect and respond to growing HIV clusters and prevent new HIV 
infections. 
 
The Budget invests $716 million in dedicated funding for the second year of the Ending the HIV 
Epidemic: A Plan for America initiative, an increase of $450 million from FY 2020.  This 
funding expands activities in the 57 target jurisdictions to increase HIV testing and access to 
prevention and treatment services.  
 
With $371 million, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) transitions from 
planning to implementation and intensifies work begun in FY 2020 in the 57 target jurisdictions.  
CDC grants to affected communities will drive additional testing with the goal in the second year 
of doubling the number of new HIV diagnoses rapidly treated with antiretroviral therapy to 
maintain health and prevent additional HIV transmissions.  Funded jurisdictions will use 
pharmacy data, telehealth, mobile testing, and new science-based networks to ensure individuals 
enter and adhere to care.   
 
With $302 million, HRSA expands HIV prevention services to all community health centers in 
the targeted initiative areas and serves 28,000 additional HIV positive people through the Ryan 
White Program.  HHS also requests $27 million for the Indian Health Service (IHS) to enhance 
HIV testing and linkages to care for American Indians and Alaska Natives.    
 
  5  Putting America’s Health First 
NIH directs $16 million to leverage pilot data from 17 Centers for AIDS Research to design and 
evaluate effective, sustainable systems to implement HIV prevention and treatment interventions 
and rapidly implement strategies at scale that will be most effective.  
 
These investments build on ongoing HIV activities supported across the Department and an 
announcement in 2019 to make pre-exposure prophylaxis medication available free of charge for 
up to 200,000 uninsured individuals each year for up to 11 years.  The donation by Gilead 
Sciences, in partnership with HHS, will help reduce the risk of HIV infections, particularly for 
individuals that may be at the highest risk. 
 
Improving Maternal Health 
Approximately 700 women die each year in the United States from pregnancy-related 
complications and more than 60 percent of these deaths are preventable.  In fact, women in the 
United States have higher rates of maternal mortality and morbidity than in any other 
industrialized nation – and the rates are rising.  In addition to rising mortality rates, severe 
maternal morbidity affects more than 50,000 women and adds significant costs to the healthcare 
system.   
 
Cardiovascular disease is now the leading cause of death in pregnancy and the postpartum 
period, constituting nearly 30 percent of pregnancy-related deaths.  Chronic hypertension – 
which is diagnosed or present before pregnancy or before 20 weeks gestation – may result in 
significant maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality.  The rate of chronic 
hypertension increased by 67 percent from 2000 to 2009, with the largest increase (87 percent) 
among African American women.  CDC points to hypertensive disorders, cerebrovascular 
accidents, and other cardiovascular conditions as some of the leading causes of maternal deaths, 
all potentially preventable conditions.  It is imperative to identify risk factors prior to pregnancy 
in order to prevent poor pregnancy and postpartum outcomes.   
 
HHS’s Improving Maternal Health in America initiative is addressing this significant public 
health problem.  This initiative focuses on four strategic goals: 
  Achieve healthy outcomes for all women of reproductive age by improving prevention 
and treatment; 
  Achieve healthy pregnancies and births by prioritizing quality improvement; 
  Achieve healthy futures by optimizing postpartum health; and 
  Improve data and bolster research to inform future interventions. 
 
The Budget provides a total of $116 million for this initiative across the National Institute for 
Research on Safety and Quality (NIRSQ), CDC, HRSA, and IHS.  This includes $7 million for 
NIRSQ to improve service data, advance data evaluation, and expand medical expenditure 
surveys to ensure policy makers have timely and accurate data.  The Budget also invests 
$24 million in CDC to expand the Maternal Mortality Review Committees to all 50 states and 
D.C. to ensure every case of pregnancy-related death is examined.  The Budget provides 
$80 million in HRSA to improve the quality of maternal health services, expand access to care, 
and reduce disparities in care.  The Budget invests $5 million in IHS to help improve health 
outcomes by standardizing care, increasing cultural awareness, and improving care for pregnant 
women.  
  6  Putting America’s Health First 
 
Advancing American Kidney Health 
Today’s status quo in kidney care carries a tremendous financial cost.  In 2016, Medicare fee-
for-service spent approximately $114 billion to cover people with kidney disease, representing 
more than one in five dollars spent by the traditional Medicare program.  In July 2019, the 
President signed an Executive Order launching an initiative to transform care for the estimated 
37 million Americans with kidney disease.  The Advancing American Kidney Health initiative 
tackles the challenges people living with kidney disease face across the stages of kidney disease, 
while also improving the lives of patients, their caregivers, and family members.   
 
The Budget includes $39 million across multiple HHS agencies and requests new legislative 
authority in support of the initiative’s three goals: 
  Reduce the number of Americans developing End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) by 25 
percent by 2030. 
  Have 80 percent of new ESRD patients in 2025 receive dialysis at home or a transplant.  
  Double the number of kidneys available for transplant by 2030. 
 
This funding also supports transplantation activities for other organs. 
 
To achieve these goals, HHS is scaling programs nationwide to optimize screening for kidney 
disease and educate patients on care options.  HHS is also supporting innovation and 
groundbreaking research to inform the next generation of targeted therapies and accelerate 
development of innovative products such as an artificial kidney.  New and pioneering payment 
models are also being developed to increase both value and quality of care for the patient. 
 
The Budget also targets new funding towards HRSA’s Organ Transplantation Program to 
remove financial disincentives for living organ donors.  The Budget invests $31 million in 
HRSA for the Organ Transplantation program, including $18.3 million for the Organ 
Procurement Transplantation Network, Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, and public 
and professional education efforts to increase public awareness about the need for organ 
donation.  In addition, the proposed rule to increase accountability and availability of the organ 
supply – announced in December 2019 – would improve the donation and transplantation rate 
measures, incentivize Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) to ensure all viable organs are 
transplanted, and hold OPOs to greater oversight, transparency, and accountability while driving 
higher OPO performance. 
 
HHS is working to accelerate innovation in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney 
disease through the Kidney Innovation Accelerator (KidneyX), a public-private partnership 
between HHS and the American Society of Nephrology.  The HHS Office of the Chief 
Technology Officer will continue the KidneyX competition in FY 2021 by challenging 
individuals, teams, and companies to build and test prototype solutions, or components of 
solutions, that can replicate normal kidney functions or improve dialysis access. 
 
The Budget proposes to establish a new program within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
Preparedness and Response (ASPR) that will advance kidney health.  The Preparedness and 
Response Innovation program will support advanced research and development, prototyping and 
  7  Putting America’s Health First 
procurement of revolutionary health security products, technologies and other innovations.  The 
program’s first project will focus on portable dialysis equipment for emergency response.  This 
will ensure that individuals with kidney failure have access to dialysis during a disaster. 
 
The Budget also advances legislative proposals to revolutionize the way patients with chronic 
kidney disease and kidney failure are diagnosed, treated, and supported.  This effort includes 
extensions of both the NIH Special Diabetes Program and IHS Special Diabetes Program for 
Indians to address chronic conditions, such as diabetes, that can lead to kidney disease.   
 
For patients who lose Medicare coverage at 36 months post-transplant and who do not have 
another source of healthcare coverage, the costs of continuing immunosuppressive drug therapy 
may be prohibitive.  Without these drugs, the patient’s body rejects the transplant, reverts to 
kidney failure, and requires dialysis.  To prevent transplant rejection and reversion to dialysis, 
the Budget proposes to establish a new federal program that provides lifetime coverage of 
immunosuppressive drugs for certain kidney transplant recipients until they are otherwise 
eligible for Medicare coverage.  The Budget also proposes to increase competition among, and 
oversight over, Organ Procurement Organizations to improve performance and increase the 
supply of organs for transplant.  In addition, the Budget advances new innovative kidney care 
payment models to encourage home dialysis, increase access to kidney transplants, and 
incentivize clinicians to better manage care for patients with kidney disease. 
 
Transforming Rural Health  
There are 57 million Americans living in rural communities.  Rural Americans face many unique 
health challenges, including hospitals that are closing or in danger of closing; difficulty 
recruiting and retaining physicians, nurses, and other providers; and increased likelihood of 
dying from many leading causes of avoidable death such as cancer and heart disease. 
 
HHS’s 4-Point Strategy to Transform Rural Health builds on current HHS initiatives in the 
following areas:  
  Build a Sustainable Health Model for Rural Communities;  
  Leverage Technology and Innovation; 
  Focus on Preventing Disease and Mortality; and 
  Increase Rural Access to Healthcare. 
 
The Budget supports rural communities through programs such as the Rural Communities 
Opioids Response Program and the Telehealth Network Grant Program at HRSA, which 
supports substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery services, and promotes telehealth 
technologies for healthcare delivery in rural communities.  Project AWARE (Advancing 
Wellness and Resiliency in Education) will increase mental health awareness training in rural 
communities.  In response to American Indian and Alaska Native communities’ demand for 
telebehavioral services, IHS expands the Telebehavioral Health Center of Excellence with 
funding for new space, updated equipment, and additional behavioral health providers. 
 
Telehealth services strive to make rural health programs more effective, increase the quality of 
healthcare, and improve health outcomes.  The Budget seeks to remove barriers to telehealth 
services in rural and underserved areas through a proposal to expand telehealth services in 
  8  Putting America’s Health First 
Medicare fee-for-service advanced payments models with more than nominal financial risk.  
This proposal broadens beneficiary access to Medicare telehealth services and addresses 
longstanding stakeholder concerns that the current statutory restrictions hinder beneficiary 
access.  The proposal expands the telehealth benefit in Medicare Fee-for-Service and provides 
authority for Rural Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers to be distant site 
providers for Medicare telehealth services.  It also permits IHS and tribal facilities to be 
originating and distant site providers, even if the facility does not meet the requirements for 
being located in certain rural or shortage areas, and allows for coverage across state lines.  The 
Budget also proposes to modernize payments to Rural Health Clinics to ensure equitable 
payment for these health clinics and help rural communities maintain access to these crucial 
services.  Finally, the Budget proposes to allow Critical Access Hospitals to voluntarily convert 
to an emergency hospital that does not maintain inpatient beds. 
 
Addressing Tick-borne Diseases 
Tick-borne diseases, of which Lyme Disease is the most common, account for 80 percent of all 
reported vector-borne disease cases each year and represent an important emerging public health 
threat in the United States.  With 59,349 reported cases in 2017, the annual number of reported 
cases has more than tripled over the last 20 years; due to under-reporting, this number 
substantially under-represents actual disease occurrence.  The geographic ranges of ticks are also 
expanding, which leads to increased risk for human exposure to the bites of infected ticks.  Most 
humans are infected through bites from very small young ticks, hosted by deer or mice.    
  
To address critical gaps in knowledge, diagnostics, and preventive measures for tick-borne 
diseases, HHS is proposing an action plan that will prioritize and advance the most promising 
candidates and technologies for diagnosing and preventing Lyme and other tick-borne 
diseases.  This plan, led by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health in partnership with 
NIH, CDC, and FDA, will address four primary areas: innovations in diagnosis and advanced 
detection, developing vaccine-based prevention, ensuring robust domestic surveillance of vector 
borne diseases, and providing additional knowledge to advance the best treatment and prevention 
options.  These efforts will improve outcomes for those affected by Lyme Disease 
symptoms.  This plan builds on the Kay Hagan Tick Act, enacted through the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act for 2020, to improve research, prevention, diagnostics, and treatment for 
tick-borne diseases.   
  
The Budget requests $189 million, an increase of $58 million, to address tick-borne diseases.  
This amount includes $115 million for NIH to expand its research on of tick-borne disease, 
including in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment; and $66 million for CDC to address vector-
borne diseases, focusing on tick-borne diseases, including tick surveillance, insecticide resistance 
activities, and development of improved diagnostics.  FDA will ensure the safety and efficacy of 
products developed to prevent, diagnose, and treat vector-borne diseases.   
 
Focusing on Influenza 
Influenza is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death, even among 
healthy people.  In the United States, millions of people are sickened, hundreds of thousands are 
hospitalized, and tens of thousands die from influenza every year.  In September 2019, the 
President signed Executive Order 13887, Modernizing Influenza Vaccines in the United States to 
  9  Putting America’s Health First 
Promote National Security and Public Health.  The Executive Order recognized influenza as a 
public health threat and national security priority, and directed HHS to prepare and protect the 
nation. 
 
The Budget invests $998 million to continue on-going influenza activities as well as targeted 
increases to support this directive.  This amount includes $306 million for ASPR to modernize 
influenza vaccine manufacturing infrastructure and advance medical countermeasure research 
and development.  Activities include additional clinical studies on licensure of pre-pandemic 
recombinant-based influenza vaccine and the advanced development of novel diagnostics, 
respiratory protective devices, and alternative vaccine delivery technology.  The Budget also 
funds the Office of Global Affairs to support US leadership of international efforts on pandemic 
influenza preparedness.  
 
The Budget requests $216 million for CDC’s Influenza program, an increase of $40 million.  
CDC will expand influenza vaccine effectiveness monitoring systems and develop and 
characterize candidate vaccine viruses for vaccine manufacturers, and efforts to improve the 
evidence-base on non-egg-based vaccines.  CDC will support whole genome characterization of 
more than 10,000 influenza viruses.  All of these activities help build domestic capacity.  CDC 
will also increase influenza vaccine use by removing barriers to vaccination and enhance 
communication to healthcare providers about the performance of influenza vaccines.   
 
The Executive Order also calls for the development of novel technologies to speed seed vaccine 
development, targeted development of vaccines that protect against multiple types of virus for 
multiple years, and to improve adjuvants.  In support of this goal, the Budget includes 
$49 million for FDA to support regulatory science research and clinical assessments to promote 
development and access to safe and effective influenza vaccines, and $423 million for NIH to 
accelerate influenza research, including universal flu vaccine development. 
 
Emergency Preparedness 
HHS plays a key role in supporting domestic and international preparedness and response to 
ensure our nation’s safety.  The Budget invests $2.6 billion in ASPR to expand efforts to prevent, 
prepare for, respond to, and recover from, the adverse health effects of public health 
emergencies.  This amount includes $562 million for the Biomedical Advanced Research and 
Development Authority to maintain a robust pipeline of innovative medical countermeasures that 
mitigate health effects of infectious diseases and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear 
agents.  It also includes $535 million for Project BioShield to support procurement of medical 
countermeasures against these threats, and $705 million for the Strategic National Stockpile to 
sustain and increase inventory of high-priority countermeasures such as antibiotics to treat 
anthrax exposure and vaccine to prevent smallpox.  These investments will help HHS advance 
progress towards national preparedness goals. 
 
NIH supports a robust research portfolio to develop vaccines and therapeutics that enable rapid 
response to public health threats including emerging microbial threats, such as extensively drug-
resistant tuberculosis, emerging viral strains such as Zika, and viral hemorrhagic fevers such as 
Ebola.  The Budget continues investments in NIH in scientific research on these new threats, and 
  10  Putting America’s Health First 
invests $120 million in FDA to facilitate medical countermeasure development and availability 
to respond in the event of a microbial or other public health threat. 
 
Strengthening the Indian Health Service 
The Administration is committed to improving the health and well-being of American Indians 
and Alaska Natives.  This population continues to experience significant health disparities, and 
the Budget includes key investments to ensure quality of care.  The Budget invests $6.2 billion in 
IHS, which includes $125 million for electronic health record modernization, provides funding to 
support IHS Services, Ending the HIV Epidemic, and Maternal Health, and includes 
$125 million for high-priority healthcare facilities construction projects.  The Budget proposes a 
new, indefinite discretionary appropriation and reforms for IHS to address Indian Self-
Determination and Education Assistance Act section 105(l) lease costs. 
 
Reforming Oversight of Tobacco Products  
The Budget proposes to move the Center for Tobacco Products out of FDA and create a new 
agency within HHS to focus on tobacco regulation.  A new agency with a mission focused on 
tobacco and its impact on public health would have greater capacity to respond rapidly to the 
growing complexity of new tobacco products.  Additionally, this reorganization will allow the 
FDA Commissioner to focus on its traditional mission of ensuring the safety of our nation’s 
drug, food, and medical products supply. 
 
Providing Shelter and Services for Unaccompanied Alien Children 
The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) provides shelter, care, and support for 
unaccompanied alien children apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security or other 
Federal Government department or agency.  The number of unaccompanied alien children 
requiring care is inherently unpredictable.  In FY 2019, ACF cared for 69,488 children, the 
highest number in the program’s history.  To ensure adequate shelter capacity and care in FY 
2021, the Budget requests a total of $2 billion in discretionary funds to support capacity of 
16,000 licensed permanent beds, depending on operational needs, and includes a mandatory 
contingency fund to provide up to $2 billion in additional resources if needed. 
 
PROMOTE INDEPENDENCE 
 
Promoting Upward Mobility 
In the human services work at HHS, the overarching goal is to promote personal responsibility, 
independence, and self-sufficiency—to help Americans lead flourishing, fulfilling, independent 
lives.  HHS programs for low-income Americans achieve this goal by supporting work, 
marriage, and family life.  HHS seeks to better align our social safety net programs with the 
booming economy, and focus on work as the means to lift families out of poverty.   
 
Many Americans are joining the workforce as the Administration’s policies continue to 
strengthen the economy and produce historically low unemployment rates.  The Administration 
supports working families by investing in child care, an important work support that helps 
families achieve independence and self-sufficiency.  The Administration is working to 
implement policies that increase access to high-quality, affordable child care.   
 
  11  Putting America’s Health First 
The Budget proposes to improve the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program 
by restoring its focus on employment and work preparation, and by targeting funds to low-
income families.  The proposal fundamentally changes the way the program measures success by 
moving to measures that focus on employment outcomes, phasing out the ineffective work 
participation rate.  In addition, the Budget establishes Opportunity and Economic Mobility 
Demonstrations that allow for the streamlining of funding from multiple safety net programs to 
deliver coordinated and effective services.  The Budget also seeks to improve consistency 
between work requirements in TANF and Medicaid by requiring that able-bodied individuals 
participate in work activities at least 20 hours per week in order to receive welfare benefits. 
 
Supporting Child Care 
Child care is an investment in both present and future generations of the workforce.  However, it 
is also one of the biggest expenses for families and can be a barrier to work.  Funding plays a 
critical role in helping families achieve self-sufficiency by providing parents access to a range of 
child care options.  In FY 2018, the most recent year for which preliminary data are available, 
over 1.3 million children from about 813,000 low-income families received a monthly child care 
subsidy from the Child Care and Development Fund.  The Budget provides $5.8 billion for the 
Child Care and Development Block Grant and $4.2 billion in mandatory child care funding for a 
total investment of $10.0 billion in child care.  The mandatory funding includes a one-time 
$1 billion fund for competitive grants to states to increase child care services for underserved 
populations and stimulate employer investment in child care.  The Budget will serve 1.9 million 
children.   
 
Promoting Adoption 
Adoption gives children stability and love during their childhood, and also a safe and stable 
environment in which to grow into responsible adults who flourish.  Approximately 20,000 
youth exit or “age out” of foster care each year without the safety net of a forever family, and 
their outcomes are often concerning.  A longitudinal study found that only 58 percent graduated 
from high school, and only half found employment by age 24.  More than a third of youth in one 
study had experienced homelessness at least once by age 26.  Children and young adults in foster 
care cannot be expected to achieve the independence they need to thrive and flourish on their 
own—but finding them a loving forever family could change all that.  
 
According to ACF, the number of children adopted with help from public child welfare agencies 
rose from 59,000 in FY 2017 to more than 63,000 in FY 2018.  To sustain this momentum, ACF 
has launched a Call to Action for states and other stakeholders, which aims to develop and 
sustain key partnerships across public and private groups, including faith-based groups, with the 
goal of reducing the number of children in foster care and increasing the number of children who 
find a forever family, through adoption or otherwise.  
 
The Adoption Assistance and Guardianship Assistance programs will provide $4.1 billion in 
FY 2021 in mandatory funding to provide monthly support payments to families adopting sibling 
  12  Putting America’s Health First 
groups or other children with special needs.  Under existing law, Adoption Assistance funding 
will keep pace with the number of qualifying children adopted each year. 
 
HHS promotes adoption through administrative actions and funding incentives to promote 
adoption, and to identify and address barriers to adoption.  Initiatives include family-finding 
programs, focusing on identifying the barriers that exist in the recruitment and development of 
foster and adoptive families, and the development and dissemination of court-related practice 
improvements addressing barriers to timely adoptions.  
 
Supporting Families and Preventing the Need for Foster Care 
Helping families receive the care and services they need before the involvement of a child 
welfare agency can help prevent a child from entering foster care.  The Administration has 
focused on primary prevention, as well as adoption, and we are starting to see better results.  
HHS is implementing the Family First Prevention Services Act (Family First Act), which 
supports services to prevent child maltreatment and the need for foster care.  This 
groundbreaking new legislation provides the opportunity for substantial improvements in 
outcomes for children and families.  The Budget proposes to streamline the process for 
evaluating evidence-based prevention services programs under the Family First Act to give states 
and tribes access to more programs that help prevent the need for foster care and assist kinship 
caregivers.  
 
The Budget invests $510 million for discretionary child welfare activities in ACF, including 
services that allow children to remain safely with their families and education and training 
vouchers for youth aging out of foster care.  In collaboration with CMS, the Budget proposes that 
Qualified Residential Treatment Programs (QRTPs) be exempted from the institution for mental 
diseases (IMD) payment exclusion allowing children in foster care to have Medicaid coverage in 
these placements even if a QRTP qualifies as an IMD. 
 
The Budget provides $197 million to ACF for child abuse prevention grants.  These grants 
support increased use of evidence-based prevention programs, allowing states to explore new 
research opportunities and to adapt more rigorous evaluations of existing programs; 
demonstration projects to test the effectiveness of partnerships that strengthen family capacity 
and prevent child abuse through the co-location of services; and state plans for safe care of 
infants affected by substance use disorders. 
 
The Budget also proposes to expand the Regional Partnership Grant program by $40 million 
each year, which will increase funding for grants that help courts, child welfare agencies, and 
other government and community entities work together and improve practices to address the 
impact of substance abuse, including opioids, on child welfare.  The Budget proposes an increase 
of $30 million each year for the Court Improvement Program to help courts improve practices 
and comply with new mandates in the Family First Act. 
  13  Putting America’s Health First 
 
Strengthening Efforts to Treat Serious Mental Illness and Serious Emotional Disturbances 
In 2018, more than 11 million adults in the U.S. were living with a serious mental illness.  More 
than 7 million children and youth experienced a serious emotional disturbance.  They faced a 
greater risk of suicide and life expectancy 10 years shorter than the general population.  
 
The Budget provides $1.1 billion to SAMHSA for serious mental illness and serious emotional 
disturbances, which includes funding to support Assertive Community Treatment for Individuals 
with Serious Mental Illness, Community Mental Health Services Block Grant, and Children’s 
Mental Health Services.  These programs provide comprehensive and coordinated mental health 
services for some of the nation’s most vulnerable populations and increases access to mental 
health services in schools.  The Budget will also provide targeted flexibility for states to provide 
inpatient mental health services to Medicaid beneficiaries with serious mental illness.  
 
The Budget also invests in programs that address the nation’s alarming rates of suicide.  Suicide 
is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States – responsible for more than 47,000 deaths 
in 2017 – and suicide rates have increased steadily for individuals of all ages.  The Budget 
provides $93 million for suicide prevention activities, including additional funding to expand 
Zero Suicide initiatives to focus on adult suicide prevention and allow communities and states to 
tailor strategies to prevent suicide in their local jurisdictions. 
 
Supporting Independence for Older Adults and People with Disabilities  
The Administration prioritizes community living for older adults and people with disabilities to 
ensure that they can maintain independence and live fully integrated in their communities.  The 
Budget invests $1.5 billion in the Administration for Community Living for critical direct 
services that enable seniors and people with disabilities to live independently, such as senior 
meals, in-home chore assistance, independent living skills training, employment training, and 
information and referral services.  These programs empower older adults and people with 
disabilities to live independently and make critical choices about their own lives. 
 
PROMOTE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT AND STEWARDSHIP 
 
HHS is responsible for more than one-quarter of total federal outlays.  The Department 
administers more grant dollars than all other federal agencies combined.  HHS is committed to 
responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars, and the Budget continues to support key reforms 
that improve the efficiency of Departmental operations. 
 
Advancing Fiscal Stewardship 
The Administration recognizes its immense responsibility to manage taxpayer dollars wisely.  
HHS ensures the integrity of all its financial transactions by leveraging financial management 
expertise, implementing strong business processes, and effectively managing risk.  
 
As the Department overseeing Medicare and Medicaid, HHS is committed to exercising proper 
oversight of these programs to protect the millions of impacted beneficiaries and the taxpayers in 
general.  In accordance with the direction in the Executive Order on Improving and Protecting 
  14  Putting America’s Health First 
Medicare, HHS is investing in the newest technological advancements, such as Artificial 
Intelligence, to enhance our ability to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse.   
 
The Department is committed to reducing improper payments in Medicare, Medicaid, and 
Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).  HHS continues to enhance existing program 
integrity tools to address improper payments and prevent fraud, including provider screening, 
prior authorization, and auditing providers and plans.  New methods and technologies will allow 
HHS oversight to reduce improper payments and adapt to the changes in healthcare as we shift 
from a fee-for-service to a value-based healthcare payment system.   
 
The Budget advances new legislative and administrative proposals to strengthen the 
Department’s ability to address weaknesses in Medicaid beneficiary eligibility determination 
processes, while providing tools to facilitate the recovery of overpayments made by states.  HHS 
also continues to support updates to Medicaid information systems that offer critical support to 
program integrity efforts, including the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System 
(T-MSIS) and a new Medicaid drug rebate system.  In addition, HHS includes proposals that 
enhance oversight of Medicare Advantage and Part D plans, increase the period of enhanced 
oversight on new providers, and expand Medicare fee-for-service prior authorization.  
 
Implementing ReImagine HHS 
HHS supports the President’s Management Agenda through ReImagine HHS, the Department’s 
robust reform and transformation effort, organized around core goals to streamline processes, 
reduce burden, and realize cost savings.  The effort takes an enterprise approach, affecting 
activities across the Department.  For example, the Buy Smarter initiative plans to use new and 
emerging technologies to leverage the enormous purchasing power of HHS and streamline the 
end-to-end procurement process.  The Maximize Talent initiative addresses modern-day human 
capital management and human resources operational challenges, resulting in key achievements:  
HHS’s simplified recruitment process resulted in a significant increase in the number of new 
hires on-boarded since implementation, and HHS was rated the “Best Place to Work in the 
Federal Government” out of all executive departments in 2019.  As part of the Bring Common 
Sense to Food Regulation initiative, FDA is working to increase collaboration between food 
regulatory programs to minimize dual jurisdiction and improve state product safety.  As a result, 
48 states and territories participate in the Produce Safety Implementation Cooperative 
Agreement Program, which increased state large farm inspections over 400 percent in FY 2019.   
 
ReImagine HHS efforts are also making HHS more innovative and responsive. Under the 
Optimizing Regional Performance initiative, HHS developed a Regional Facilities Utilization 
Model with $150 million in potential savings and a footprint reduction of more than 62 percent 
within ten years.  For the first time since 1974, HHS completed a comprehensive assessment of 
regions to better align with Administration priorities and improve HHS’s ability to serve 
Americans across the country.  In addition, under the Optimize Coordination Across HHS 
initiative, HHS configured a new cloud environment for an administrative data hub to provide 
dashboarding capabilities for Operating Divisions, bringing together human resources, travel, 
and facilities data to inform better decision-making across the enterprise.   
 
  15  Putting America’s Health First 
In FY 2021, all ReImagine HHS projects will reside in their permanent offices within HHS.  This 
ensures that their work can sustainably continue going forward. 
 
Grants Management 
HHS continues to drive change for grants management government-wide.  Leveraging the efforts 
and success of the HHS ReImagine Grants Management initiative.  The Office of Management 
and Budget pre-designated HHS as the Grants Quality Services Management Office (QSMO) to 
create and manage a marketplace of solutions for grants management; govern its long-term 
sustainability; institute a customer engagement model; and drive the implementation of standards 
and solutions to modernize grants management processes and systems.  Guided by a 
government-wide governance board, QSMOs are tasked with offering solutions that, over time, 
will improve quality of service and customer satisfaction; modernize and automate processes and 
supporting technology; standardize processes and data; and achieve efficiencies in government-
wide operations and maintenance. 
 
In FY 2018, the government awarded over $750 billion in grants to approximately 40,000 
recipients across more than 1,500 programs.   
 
Full designation as the Grants QSMO is contingent upon approval of a 5-Year Implementation 
Plan and budget estimate in alignment with the published QSMO Long-term Designation 
Criteria.  HHS is developing a vision and strategy to inform the Grants QSMO 5-Year 
Implementation Plan, with significant engagement with stakeholders to ensure the Grants QSMO 
can meet their diverse needs. 
 
Regulatory Reduction 
HHS is committed to streamlining the regulatory process and evaluating necessary steps to 
eliminate or change regulations that impose unnecessary burden.  Burdensome regulations can 
drive up costs of healthcare, while poorly designed regulations can come between doctors and 
patients, reducing the quality of care and the essential trust to that relationship.  From FY 2017 to 
FY 2019, HHS succeeded in cutting the economic burden of its regulations by $25.7 billion 
through 46 deregulatory actions.  HHS had the largest deregulatory impact of any Cabinet 
agency during this time period.   
 
HHS is using the power of new cognitive technologies for greater operational effectiveness and 
research insights, including regulatory reduction.  HHS used an Artificial Intelligence-driven 
regulation analysis tool and expert insight to analyze the Code of Federal Regulations, seeking 
potential opportunities to modernize regulations.  HHS since launched a Department-wide 
Regulatory Clean-Up Initiative to implement changes based on these findings, by reviewing and 
– where a change is warranted – addressing incorrect citations and eliminating the submission of 
triplicate or quadruplicate of the same citation. 
 
HHS is working to implement the provisions of the Executive Order on Promoting the Rule of 
Law through Improved Agency Guidance Documents.  This Executive Order will accomplish 
important policy goals that will improve HHS guidance practices in the long term.  Prior to the 
issuance of this Executive Order, several Federal agencies issued internal memoranda regarding 
the appropriate use of guidance.  The Executive Order requires agencies to now go a step further 
  16  Putting America’s Health First 
and codify certain good guidance practices and policies into Federal regulations.  By August 27, 
2020, each agency must finalize regulations to set forth processes and procedures for issuing 
guidance documents.  In addition, by February 28, 2020, Federal agencies must establish a 
single, searchable database on its website that contains, or links to, all of the agency’s guidance 
documents currently in effect.  Any guidance document not included in the guidance website is 
deemed rescinded.  HHS is committed to meeting the President’s timelines.

TESTIMONY 
 
OF 
 
CHAD WOLF 
 
ACTING SECRETARY 
 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
 
REGARDING A HEARING ON 
 
“THE FY 2021 DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY BUDGET” 
 
BEFORE THE 
 
UNITED STATES SENATE 
 
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS  
 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY 
 
February 25, 2020 
Washington, D.C. 
 
   
 
Chairman Capito, Ranking Member Tester, and distinguished Members of the 
Subcommittee: 
 
It is a privilege to appear before you today to discuss the Department of Homeland Security’s 
(DHS) critical mission functions that keep this Nation safe and to present the President’s Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2021 Budget for the Department.  This budget will serve as a catalyst to assist DHS in 
maintaining pace with adversaries attempting to circumvent our laws and threaten our citizens 
and our way life.  
  
My priorities are guided by a determination to ensure the Department is three things: robust, 
resilient and forward-leaning.  The FY 2021 President’s Budget is not only a reflection of those 
priorities but a path to achieving them. 
        
DHS is comprised of eight major Components and many support Components and employs more 
than 240,000 men and women who stand ready to respond to a wide variety of threats in some of 
the most extreme and austere environments.  These harsh conditions include Border Patrol 
Agents patrolling the U.S. border in southern Arizona where temperatures reach upwards of 120 
degrees, to the crew of the United States Coast Guard Cutter POLAR STAR, breaking ice as 
thick as 21 feet in the Antarctic Region where temperatures fluctuate between -40 to -90 degrees 
to conduct national security missions.   
 
These men and women continue to make significant contributions to the larger homeland 
security apparatus as they stand watch 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, (or 
366 days this year given it is a leap year).  Our mission is to protect Americans and the homeland 
from threats by land, air, sea and cyberspace while promoting the nation’s economic prosperity 
through the facilitation of legitimate travel and commerce.  This balance to ensure security 
without impeding the freedom of movement is a very delicate one and the men and women of the 
Department of Homeland Security continue to execute it with tenacity and compassion. 
 
The Department’s key budget priorities remain consistent with recent years; Securing Our 
Borders, Enforcing Our Immigration Laws, Securing Cyberspace and Critical Infrastructure, 
Transportation Security and American Preparedness.  However, there are emerging threats that 
underscore the importance of the Department’s global reach.  This budget recognizes that fact 
and positions the Department to respond.   
 
Though the United States has long faced isolated threats from China, Iran, and Russia, we are at 
a critical time in our Nation’s history as it relates to threats emanating from these Nation states.  
While the Administration works trade negotiations with China toward the goal of achieving a fair 
and balanced trade deal that both countries can call successful, we must increase pressure on the 
Chinese government for the ongoing violations of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) laws.  These 
violations continue to reduce market opportunities and undermine the profitability of United 
States businesses as sales of products and technologies are undercut by competition from illegal 
lower-cost imitations.  Additionally, there are increasing concerns with the Chinese 
government’s continued investment into U.S. interests and their impact to national and economic 
security.  Specifically, as the United States builds out capacity within the 5G network, we must  
 
2 
 
 
maintain a proactive posture in addressing a multitude of cybersecurity threats and 
vulnerabilities.    
 
The increased tension with Iran forced the Department to assume an enhanced security posture, 
particularly in the cybersecurity domain to prevent threats aimed at revenge for the recent death 
of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.  The Department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA) continues to monitor an uptick in malicious activity by pro-Iranian 
hackers and social media users as Iran possesses the capability and tendency to launch 
destructive cyber-attacks.  The 2016 election is a stark reminder that Russia remains a significant 
threat to our democratic process.  And with a Presidential Election this November, it has never 
been more important to increase our digital defense to prevent cybersecurity threats from 
influencing electoral outcomes.  
 
To emphasize the variation in threats facing the Department, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) 
which originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, continues to spread to other parts of the 
world at a pace that has the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and DHS at the 
ready.  At CDC’s request, DHS directed all flights en route to the U.S., via direct or connecting 
flights from China, to land at predetermined airports to facilitate enhanced screenings and 
potential quarantine if necessary.  As the DHS lead for coordinating with interagency partners, 
Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) is currently supporting these enhanced 
health screenings through contracts with local EMS, public health, and/or first responders.  These 
contracts allow front line Officers and Agents to remain focused on the law enforcement 
mission. The President used his authority to implement travel restrictions on all non-U.S. citizen 
and non-legal permanent resident travelers who have been in China in the last 14 days.  These 
actions are protecting the American people and help prevent the virus from spreading.  Based on 
current information, the risk from COVID-19 to the American public remains low.  Nevertheless, 
DHS responded with proactive safeguards and is prepared to increase these measures should it 
become necessary. 
 
The FY 2021 President’s Budget for DHS includes $49.8 billion in net discretionary funding and 
an additional $5.1 billion for the disaster relief fund (DRF) to support response to and recovery 
from major disasters in the homeland.  By providing the men and women of DHS the necessary 
resources to execute their important and extremely complex missions, the President’s Budget 
ensures we continue our current trajectory of reinforcing the security of our nation through 
enhanced border security, immigration enforcement, transportation security, resilience to 
disasters, and cyber security. 
     
To help frame the rising threat, I would like to highlight some of last year’s operational 
achievements.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) processed and cared for an 
unprecedented number of migrant families and children.  Encounters and apprehensions totaled 
more than 851,000 along the U.S. Southwest Border (SWB) alone.  This total included more than 
76,000 unaccompanied children and approximately 474,000 family units.  This was a 110 
percent increase over FY 2019 apprehension totals (404,142).  They inspected over 410 million 
travelers, arrested almost 13,000 wanted individuals and prevented nearly 299,000 inadmissible 
travelers from entering the United States.  Additionally, their combined efforts with CBP’s 
National Targeting Center (NTC), the Immigration Advisory Program and the Regional Carrier 
3 
 
 
Liaison Group prevented the boarding of almost 19,000 high-risk travelers from boarding flights 
inbound to the United States.  AMO executed nearly 93,000 flight hours and more than 33,000 
float hours in balancing law enforcement and humanitarian operations.  This effort included 300 
flight hours during a two-week period to provide relief to Bahamian citizens in the aftermath of 
Hurricane Dorian and 3,600 flight hours dedicated to the migrant caravan surge along the SWB.     
 
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) worked tirelessly alongside 
Federal, State and local election officials leading up to the 2018 mid-term elections and in 
preparation for the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election.  Over 500 CISA employees supported 
election security preparedness nationwide, including providing technical cybersecurity 
assistance, information sharing and expertise to election offices, campaigns and technology 
vendors, this included staffing a nationwide virtual watch floor.  As part of Active Shooter 
Preparedness, CISA also provided information to the critical infrastructure community and 
general public to help prepare emergency action plans and education on steps to increase incident 
survivability.  Specifically, 39 in-person workshops with over 3,600 participants were conducted; 
nearly 87,000 people successfully completed an online course and a website focusing on active 
shooter training was viewed more than 937,000 times by the public.  
 
United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) naturalized 833,000 new citizens, 
an 11-year high in new oaths of citizenship. The number of refugee applicants interviewed nearly 
doubled from FY 2018 to 44,300 (from 26,000).  These interviews supported the admission of 
33,000 refugees to the United States which was a 32 percent increase over last year.  USCIS also 
completed 78,580 affirmative asylum applications, and experienced a six percent rise in credible 
fear cases processed to 103,235.         
 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed over 12,300 FEMA personnel 
and 519 FEMA Corps personnel in support of 99 major disaster declarations including Hurricane 
Dorian, 22 emergency declarations and one Fire Management Assistance Grant declaration 
across 45 States, tribes and territories.       
  
United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) removed nearly 268,000 individuals 
from the United States and arrested over 143,000 individuals.  Homeland Security Investigations 
made nearly 50,000 arrests, approximately 80% of which were criminal arrests, including over 
4,300 gang leaders, members, and associates.  These gang arrests included 452 Mara Salvatrucha 
(MS-13) gang members.       
 
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened approximately 839 million 
passengers, 1.9 billion carry-on items and 510 million checked bags in FY 2019.  This was a 
4.3% increase in checkpoint volume which equates to an average increase of over 95,000 
passengers per day.  They enrolled over 2.1 million new individuals in TSA’s PreCheck 
Application Program which is designed to increase security throughput by expediting trusted 
travelers and reducing security screening times. 
 
The United States Coast Guard (USCG), through their search and rescue efforts, saved 4,335 
lives and prevented over $41 million in property loss.  Over 400 of those lives saved were during 
Hurricane Dorian response efforts.  Simultaneously, while executing their law enforcement 
4 
 
 
responsibility, they removed over 458,000 pounds of cocaine and 63,000 pounds of marijuana 
with estimated wholesale value of $6.2 billion.   
 
The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office completed 155 surge 
deployments of the Mobile Detection Deployment (MDD) Program, enhancing interdiction 
efforts and expanding law enforcement partners’ ability to protect the Nation from a Weapon of 
Mass Destruction threat.  This was an increase of over 115 percent from FY 2018 (72 
deployments).  Additionally, CWMD conducted more than 100 training exercises, training 
events and informational briefings with partners and stakeholders to develop doctrine, create 
training curriculum and validate readiness.       
 
The United States Secret Service conducted protective advances for nearly 6,500 visits and 
traveled overseas with protection details on 395 foreign visits.  The Secret Service seized $369 
million in counterfeit U.S. currency, an 81% increase over the previous year.  Finally, the Secret 
Service closed 1,718 Cyber Financial Crime cases, an increase of 160 percent over FY 2018 and 
experienced an 18 percent rise in Cyber Financial Crime cases opened, while the Cyber Financial 
Potential Losses Prevented increased by 36 percent ($5.2 billion to $7.1 billion) during the same 
year.      
 
Last year’s operational achievements serve as a baseline from which to determine the 
incremental growth of threats to the homeland in the coming years.  Analyzing the previous 
year’s statistical achievements also allows DHS to plan for future threats accordingly.  The FY 
2021 President’s Budget for DHS is an opportunity for Congress to provide the men and women 
charged with executing complex missions with the necessary prevention, response and recovery 
resources. 
 
The security of our Nation’s borders remains a primary focus area for the Administration and 
this Department.  Border security is national security as any nation’s sovereignty begins with its 
ability to secure its physical borders.  Securing the border is extremely complex and requires a 
multifaceted approach.  The Department has long executed a defense-in-depth model when it 
comes to border security.  There are 5,000 miles of border between the United States and Canada 
and over 1,900 miles shared with Mexico.  The President’s Budget is a step toward enhancing 
border security through investments in staffing, infrastructure and technology.  Without a 
strategy that involves these key investments, border security would be unattainable.   
 
The President’s Budget includes $2.0 billion for the construction of approximately 82 miles of 
new border wall system.  This funding supports real estate and environmental planning, land 
acquisition, wall system design, construction and oversight.  While a physical barrier alone does 
not solve all border security concerns, it remains foundational to a strategy for achieving 
operational control of the SWB.  A physical barrier is a proven deterrent as well as a mechanism 
for channeling activity to predetermined points along the border which allows DHS to allocate 
response resources with much more precision.   
 
Domain awareness is a vital component to border security and complements a physical barrier by 
providing increased opportunities for actionable intelligence, especially in remote areas with 
little infrastructure.  To complement the physical barrier, the budget includes $28 million to 
5 
 
 
increase domain awareness through the deployment of 30 Autonomous Surveillance Towers 
(formerly Innovative Towers) across the Southwest border.  The towers are designed to provide 
persistent electronic surveillance in remote areas of the border without the need for a permanent 
Border Patrol Agent presence.  The data derived from these sensors will be relayed in real-time 
to the Air and Marine Operations Center and local Border Patrol Stations and/or Sectors for 
processing, threat determination and response execution.   
 
The President’s Budget seeks funding for a number of CBP’s airframe and sensor modifications, 
conversions and/or upgrades.  These platform improvements are multi-purposed as they provide 
increased levels of domain awareness and are instrumental in interdiction and humanitarian 
operations.  They include $15.5 million to convert an Army HH-60L to CBP’s versatile UH-60 
Medium Lift Helicopter configuration.  UH-60s are the only assets in CBP’s fleet that have 
medium lift capability and are rugged enough to support interdiction and life-saving operations 
in extreme or hostile environments (desert, extreme cold or open water).  The Budget includes 
$14.3 million to upgrade a DHC-8 Maritime Patrol Aircraft.  These aircraft operate under broad 
operational spectrums, including coastal/maritime boundaries in the Caribbean and Latin 
America.  The Budget also requests $13.0 million for the replacement of obsolete, out of 
production aircraft sensor integrated mission systems.  Systems requiring replacement include 
non-High Definition (HD) Electro Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors, outdated mapping systems, 
video displays, recorders and data links that facilitate real-time data exploitation.        
       
While technology plays an important role in the Department’s day-to-day missions, our most 
critical resource remains our personnel.  As the Department remains focused on threats from 
those attempting to circumvent existing laws, we cannot lose sight of the year-over-year increase 
in the volume of legitimate trade and travel.  This volume increase, can limit the time CBP has to 
conduct necessary threat analysis down to minutes or seconds without impacting the legitimate 
movement of people and goods.   
 
The President’s Budget seeks funding for additional personnel within several Departmental 
Components including; $161 million for 750 Border Patrol Agents and 126 support personnel, 
with an additional $54 million to sustain 250 Agents hired in FY 2019 and FY 2020; $544 
million for ICE to add an additional 2,844 law enforcement officers and 1,792 support personnel; 
and, $3.5 billion to fund 47,596 Transportation Security Officers, which supports the projected 4 
percent increase in volume.  The FY 2021 Budget also accounts for a 3 percent pay increase for 
the uniformed men and women of the Coast Guard, a 1 percent civilian pay increase, and an 
additional 1 percent increase in award spending, along with annualizing the 3.1 percent civilian 
pay raise in 2020.   
 
The majority of these personnel increases are targeted for frontline Agents and Officers.  
However, across the Department there will be staffing increases in various support positions.  
U.S. Border Patrol, for example, will use Processing Coordinators to perform non-border 
security, non-law enforcement officer activities such as support activities related to processing or 
providing humanitarian support.  This additional increase will allow frontline Agents and 
Officers currently assigned to perform administrative duties out of necessity, to focus more time 
on operational responsibilities. 
 
6 
 
 
 
DHS is committed to enforcing immigration laws across the nation, including the interior of the 
United States.  Our priority is to identify, detain, and remove criminals from the United States 
that are here illegally with particular attention focused on those individuals posing a threat to 
public safety.  The Department does not intend on stopping there; those employers who 
knowingly break the law for the self-serving purpose of cheap labor will be identified and 
brought to justice.  
 
FY 2019 apprehensions between the ports of entry along the Southwest border increased 115% 
when compared to FY 2018.  This unprecedented spike in illegal crossings drove a 
corresponding increase in the ICE average daily population (ADP).  The resulting effect was an 
increase in historical occupancy levels within DHS detention facilities.  Forecasting models 
reinforce the need for an increase in ICE’s detention beds to 60,000 (55,000 adult and 5,000 
family).  The budget includes $3.1 billion for this capacity increase and ensures ICE is able to 
maintain pace with projected migration flows and enhance enforcement activity within the 
interior of the United States. 
 
We must continue to increase our digital defense as cybersecurity threats grow in scope and 
severity.  The FY 2021 President’s Budget is poised to continue investments in the Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to assess evolving cybersecurity risks and protect 
Federal Government information systems and critical infrastructure.  CISA continues to work 
tirelessly to ensure cyber-attacks are unable to compromise or disrupt Federal networks.  With 
the November Presidential Election fast approaching, CISA is also working with State and local 
organizations in all 50 states to ensure American elections are decided by Americans without 
outside interference.  Accordingly, the President’s Budget seeks $1.1 billion in CISA 
cybersecurity operational costs and investments for programs to include the Continuous 
Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program and the National Cybersecurity Protection System 
in order to strengthen the security posture for government networks and systems.  The budget 
also includes $157.6 million for the Emergency Communications program which enables 
improved public safety communications services throughout the nation.  This program also 
manages funding, sustainment and grant programs to support communications interoperability 
and builds capacity with Federal, State, local, tribal and territorial stakeholders.    
 
The Coast Guard is a unique Component given it is the only branch of the U.S. Armed Forces 
within DHS.  As a military service and a law enforcement organization with a regulatory 
responsibility, they possess broad jurisdictional authorities and flexible operational capabilities.  
This combination necessitates an inherent need to ensure they are postured for rapid response to 
a variety of missions with a modernized fleet that supports these requirements.   
 
The President’s Budget includes $555 million to support the Polar Security Cutter (PSC) 
program management and to fund the construction of PSC 2.  This acquisition recapitalizes the 
Coast Guard’s heavy polar icebreaker fleet to support national interest in the Polar Regions and 
provide assured surface presence in ice-impacted waters.  The Budget also includes an additional 
$153 million for existing airframe modernization (combines $88 million for Fixed-Wing Aircraft 
and $65 million for Rotary-Wing Aircraft).  These improvements will help ensure the Coast 
Guard fleet is appropriately equipped for the complex missions they are charged with executing.  
7 
 
 
This modernization effort aligns the Coast Guard’s recapitalization of airframes with the 
Department of Defense Future Vertical Lift acquisitions to create additional acquisition 
efficiencies.  Finally, $564 million is included for the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC).  This 
funding supports the production of OPC #3 and Long Lead Time Materials for OPC #4 along 
with technical and program management costs.      
 
The FY 2021 President’s Budget includes $96 million in additional resources, distributed across 
several Components to fund the Targeting Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP) program.  
This program is designed to support early detection and prevention of radicalization of 
individuals prone to violence by interrupting those efforts with appropriate action by leveraging 
civic organizations, law enforcement and community organizations.  The Department’s 
investment includes Components vested in research and development, early detection and 
response.  
 
What makes the United States great is its resiliency in the face of adversity and hardship.  
Throughout our storied history, there are dozens if not hundreds of examples of that resiliency 
displayed.  And though the people of this country are resilient by nature, it is important that we 
as a Department appropriately plan ahead for things we know are coming including hurricanes, 
earthquakes and fires.  One of FEMA’s strategic goals is to Ready the Nation for Catastrophic 
Disasters.  The FY 2021 President’s Budget helps FEMA achieve this goal by funding numerous 
initiatives aimed at preparedness and disaster recovery.  FEMA continues to invest in State and 
local governments to increase preparedness and resiliency.  The budget includes $2.5 billion to 
support State, local, tribal and territorial governments in the form of non-disaster grants and 
training.  These funds are key in sustaining and building new capabilities to prevent, protect 
against, respond to, recover from and mitigate high consequence disasters and emergencies in 
our Nation’s high-risk transit systems, ports, and along our borders.  
 
In addition, the Nation’s transportation systems are inherently open environments.  Part of TSA’s 
mission is to protect these systems to ensure the free and secure movement of people and 
commerce.  U.S. transportation systems accommodate approximately 965 million domestic and  
international aviation passengers annually, that number is in the billions when you factor in, 
over-the-road buses and mass transit systems.     
 
Ensuring effective screening of air passengers remains a top priority for TSA.  In an effort to 
balance the need for increased security without impeding freedom of movement for legitimate 
travelers, the President’s Budget includes $28.9 million to expand TSA’s Computed 
Tomography (CT) Screening capability.  CT Screening is the most impactful property screening 
tool available today.  Not only is it more effective against non-conventional concealment 
methods but it eliminates the need for passenger to remove electronic items from carry-on bags.  
This combination improves security and expedites the screening process to increase passenger 
throughput efficiency.  To offset TSA operations, a $1.00 increase is proposed in the Aviation 
Passenger Security Fee.  This minimal increase would generate approximately $618 million in 
additional revenue and help defray the increasing cost of aviation security.  
 
Finally, the FY 2021 President’s Budget proposes to transfer the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) 
functions, personnel, assets and obligations along with the functions and responsibilities of the 
8 
 
 
Secretary of Homeland Security related to the Secret Service over to the Department of the 
Treasury.   
 
I have only touched on a handful of priorities included in the FY 2021 President’s Budget for 
DHS.  This is not intended to convey a message of less importance for those Components, 
resources or initiatives not highlighted.  DHS executes its vast mission responsibility using a 
defense-in-depth strategy and much of DHS’s success is predicated on this approach to 
execution.  Components within the Department have individual mission responsibilities however, 
they cannot disassociate themselves from one another as their daily activities are intertwined to 
close gaps in security, resiliency and economic prosperity.  Accordingly, those Components, 
resources or initiatives not listed remain just as important.       
 
I continue to be amazed by the professionalism, dedication, and tenacity displayed daily by the 
men and women of this Department.  Their resolve and genuine commitment to the complex 
homeland security mission is above reproach and we should all sleep better at night knowing 
they are on duty. Despite their continued commitment, they cannot safely nor effectively execute 
their mission without the proper resources.  Therefore, I ask for your support in providing them 
the resources needed to keep our families safe through the FY 2021 President’s Budget. 
    
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you and discuss the Department’s FY 2021 
Budget submission and I look forward to taking your questions.

HEARING ON OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION: 
SPECTRUM AUCTIONS PROGRAM, PART 2 
 
BEFORE THE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT 
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS   
UNITED STATES SENATE  
 
NOVEMBER 21, 2019 
 
Chairman Kennedy, Ranking Member Coons, and Members of the Financial Services and 
General Government Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Federal 
Communications Commission’s spectrum auctions program. 
Since Congress authorized the FCC to conduct spectrum auctions in the Budget Reconciliation 
Act of 1993, auctions have been one of the primary spectrum management tools of the Commission.  
While auctions may be the most visible of such tools, the Commission employs a broad array of 
mechanisms for making spectrum available and resolving mutual exclusivity in spectrum use as required 
by the Communications Act.  Other examples of these mechanisms include unlicensed and license-by-rule 
frameworks that have made technologies like Wi-Fi pervasive and successful.   
Auctions are an increasingly integral part of the Commission's core missions.  In light of the 
Commission’s diverse auctions portfolio, which goes beyond spectrum auctions for mobile wireless use, 
and because good auction design must be based on sound economics, the Auctions Division was moved 
from the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to become a fundamental part of the new Office of 
Economics and Analytics (OEA).  We appreciate the Appropriations Committee’s grant of reorganization 
authority, without which the Commission would not have been able to establish OEA and bring economic 
and data analysis and auction design and execution under one roof. 
OEA draws upon economic and data analytics expertise to ensure that the Commission is taking 
the most efficient and effective approach in all auctions and spectrum management more generally.  In 
designing and holding spectrum auctions, the Commission adheres closely to the objectives established 
by Congress in 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(3), including “the development and rapid deployment of new 
technologies, products, and services for the benefit of the public.”  Consistent with Congress’s mandate, 
the Commission balances the aforementioned objective with other statutory objectives such as ensuring 
the spectrum’s efficient and intensive use, and providing parties with adequate time to consider and 
comment on auction procedures, develop business plans, and assess market conditions.1   
Once a spectrum band is identified for licensing and technical rules for the licenses are 
established, the Commission determines the most effective type of auction for that particular band.  When 
                                                            
1 47 U.S.C. §§ 309(j)(3)(D), (E). 
1 
determining the type of auction to use, the Commission considers several factors, such as the number and 
size of the geographic areas and spectrum blocks that will be made available, the likely use cases for the 
licenses and any interference issues, the potential need to transition or accommodate existing incumbent 
users, and the number of potential bidders to ensure that the auction will be efficient and that bidding will 
not be prolonged unnecessarily.  We then seek comment on proposed application and bidding procedures 
to allow potential bidders and other interested parties or experts the opportunity to provide feedback on 
our proposals.   
After considering the public input, the Commission resolves any issues and establishes final 
auction procedures prior to opening a filing window, during which prospective bidders apply to 
participate in the auction.  Commission staff then reviews bidder applications, working with potential 
bidders to ensure their applications are complete.  Commission staff also reviews the upfront payments 
submitted by applicants with complete applications and announces the list of qualified bidders.  
Beginning with the application stage and proceeding up until the start of the auction, Commission staff 
provide seminars and other educational materials and field questions to ensure that bidders are familiar 
with application bidding systems and aware of their obligations. 
Following the guideposts established by Congress in 309(j), the Commission has conducted 93 
spectrum auctions and generated $116.5 billion in revenue for the U.S. Treasury.   
Innovative and modern spectrum management principles are essential, especially now that  
greenfield spectrum has become rarer.  The decision of whether and how to license a particular spectrum 
band has become more complex and depends on the unique characteristics of the band in question.  In 
each case, we must either find a way to accommodate those existing services and licensees in a different 
part of the radio spectrum or develop a set of rules and tools to share the spectrum without causing 
harmful interference.  Where spectrum bands have incumbents, we must develop a plan to ensure that 
they and their customers are not harmed, while providing certainty and clarity to bidders as to what and 
when the spectrum will be available. 
Several successful past auctions illustrate how we’ve been able to balance the needs of 
incumbents and prospective bidders.  These examples illustrate how different each incumbent transition 
situation is—and how unique the solutions must be.  In our first spectrum auction in 1993, personal 
communications service license winners were required to relocate the incumbent point-to-point 
microwave services to higher frequencies that Commission staff had determined were available. 
The auction for Advanced Wireless Services–3 spectrum successfully transitioned federal users to 
other bands due in large part to Congress establishing a mechanism for federal users to recover relocation 
costs from a portion of the proceeds of the auction, which were transferred to the Spectrum Relocation 
Fund pursuant to the Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act.  The federal government also published 
the transition plan for its users to provide certainty to the auction bidders about when they would be able 
to use the spectrum.  This involved an extensive effort by our partners at the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration and other federal agencies. 
To facilitate our efforts to free more spectrum for flexible wireless use, Congress provided the 
FCC with incentive auction authority in 2012. In 2017, the FCC concluded its first incentive auction, 
which provided payments to broadcast television stations that chose to relinquish their spectrum and 
repacked other stations so that they could maintain operations while using a narrower range of 
spectrum.  That auction ended up making available 70 megahertz of licensed spectrum for mobile 
broadband use in the 600 MHz band.  The entire process was one of the most complex engineering 
exercises the Commission had ever undertaken.  Today we are far along in the repack of the TV 
stations, and wireless carriers are already offering service in the spectrum that was cleared, thanks in 
large part to the careful initial planning of the FCC. 
We appreciate Congress’s support of innovative techniques such as incentive auctions, and we are 
2 
continuing to use this authority constructively as we deal with spectrum already licensed and in use.  The 
Commission recently adopted an incentive auction mechanism that will make available more spectrum 
than any auction in American history—3,400 megahertz of spectrum throughout the Upper 37 GHz, 39 
GHz, and 47 GHz bands.  While the broadcast incentive auction used separate forward and reverse 
auctions, for Auction 103 the Commission provided a reconfiguration process for incumbents that 
allowed them to relinquish their rights or accept modified licenses suitable for use with new technologies.  
As a result, the clock phase of Auction 103 will determine the prices paid to incumbents relinquishing 
their existing licenses, which may be applied to the value of any new licenses won at the auction.  
Bidding for these licenses in Auction 103 will begin on December 10th. 
The Commission has also adopted a novel, innovative regulatory regime that allows for 
dynamic sharing in the 3.5 GHz band between federal incumbents and non-federal users and opens up 
mid-band spectrum for 5G and other commercial uses.  The three-tiered, hierarchical framework 
prioritizes incumbent federal users.  Second-tier Priority Access Licenses (PALs) in turn receive 
protections from third-tier General Authorized Access (GAA), which is license-by-rule.  Automated 
frequency coordinators, known as Spectrum Access Systems (SAS), will coordinate operations, and 
Environmental Sensing Capability operators will detect the presence of federal incumbent radar 
transmissions and communicate with the SASs.  On June 25, 2020, we will begin the auction for seven 
10-megahertz channel PALs in every county across the country—a total of 22,631 licenses, which will 
be the most licenses ever offered in an FCC spectrum auction. 
In sum, every spectrum band the Commission has auctioned required careful consideration of the 
band’s circumstances and characteristics to determine how best to make it available.  And because we are 
packing more services into a finite spectrum resource, each new band presents more complex challenges 
than the ones before. 
The C-band at 3.7–4.2 GHz perhaps best illustrates this point.  One of the three prongs of the 
Commission’s strategy for Facilitating America’s Superiority in 5G Technology—the 5G FAST Plan—is 
to make spectrum available in low-, mid-, and high-frequency bands.  The 3.7–4.2 GHz band falls in that 
mid-band range and is particularly attractive for deployment of advanced wireless services because it 
offers a great balance of both coverage and bandwidth.   
The primary user of the 3.7–4.2 GHz band is Fixed Satellite Service downlinks.  These links 
provide connectivity for delivery of content to cable systems, broadcasters, and religious organizations.  
The satellite service is provided by several satellite licensees to more than 20,000 registered earth stations 
spread throughout the continental United States. 
Unlike other bands that we have repurposed, where the incumbents had exclusive licenses, here 
eight different satellite operators have non-exclusive rights to use the C-Band to provide service to the 
continental United States.  They deliver service via transponders that are mapped across the 500 
megahertz and deliver the content to satellite earth station dishes that are aimed at satellites.  In other 
words, the satellite systems are integrated in ways that were engineered by the licensees such that their 
cooperation is critical to the process of freeing up spectrum. 
Chairman Pai has laid out four principles he has said would guide the agency in approaching the 
C-Band proceeding.  First, we must make available a significant amount of spectrum for 5G.  Second, we 
must make this spectrum available for 5G quickly.  Third, we must generate revenue for the federal 
government.  And fourth, we must ensure that the services currently using the C-Band will continue to be 
delivered to the American people.  And Chairman Pai has previously announced that he would make a 
decision on how the FCC should proceed by this fall. 
Earlier this week, Chairman Pai sent letters to Senators and members of the House of 
Representatives that had expressed an interest in the C-Band proceeding announcing his view that the 
FCC should proceed with a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-Band conducted by Commission 
3 
staff.  This approach best achieves the Chairman’s four goals, which are consistent with Congress’s 309(j) 
objectives.  With a quarter-century track record of transparent and successful auctions, we are planning to 
conduct a public auction that will afford all parties a fair opportunity to compete for this 5G spectrum, 
while preserving the availability of the upper 200 megahertz of this band for the continued delivery of 
programming.  And we are confident that we can commence this auction before the end of 2020. 
Guiding the Chairman’s decision was his view that the proposed private sale offered by the C-
Band Alliance was unlikely to be fair and transparent.  Small bidders were unlikely to participate in the 
C-Band Alliance’s original planned auction that one commenter described as “fiendishly complex.”  And 
the Alliance’s most recent pitch rejected industry-standard online bidding mechanisms, reducing the 
transparency of the auction and making it more likely to simply fail.  Given that bidders across the board 
have repeatedly made clear that the rules and protections of an FCC-run auction were needed for this 
potentially multi-billion sale, the Chairman concluded that the tried-and-true method of a public auction 
was the fastest and best means to get this spectrum to market. 
The Chairman has announced that he expects a Commission vote on the public auction early next 
year.  In the coming weeks, we will continue to work toward resolutions that will create a fair, 
transparent, and swift process consistent with the Chairman’s goals and Congress’s objectives.

U.S. Department of State 
 
Testimony 
 
Before the Senate Appropriations Committee 
 
Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  
 
 
October 23, 2019 
   
 
Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Leahy, distinguished Members of the 
Committee, thank you for inviting me here to testify on this important issue.  As 
you know, I have just returned from Ankara and I look forward to discussing the 
October 17 Joint Turkish-U.S. Statement (October 17 Joint Statement) on northeast 
Syria, which established a five day pause in Turkish military operations in the 
northeast running to October 22,  a withdrawal of Peoples Protection Unit (YPG) 
forces from those areas controlled by the Turkish military, and if all goes well a 
more permanent halt to the Turkish operation, as well as joint Turkish-U.S. efforts 
towards the population in the affected ‘safe zone’ area to ensure security, decent 
treatment of religious and ethnic minorities and restoration of the security smashed 
by the Turkish offensive beginning October 8. 
 
The conflict in Syria has raged for over eight years, fueled by Bashar al-
Assad’s regime and his despotic and barbaric treatment of Syrian citizens, Russia’s 
continued enabling of Assad’s brutality, and Iran’s malign influence in the region.   
 
U.S. strategic objectives and national security interests in Syria remain the 
enduring defeat of ISIS, al-Qa’ida, and their affiliates in Syria, the reduction and 
expulsion of Iranian malign influence; and resolution of the Syrian civil war on 
terms favorable to the United States and our allies and in line with UN Security 
Council Resolution 2254.  A sound strategy for use of our assistance resources is 
key to achieving these goals. 
 
The United States has worked closely with our local partners, including the 
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeast Syria, in the campaign to defeat ISIS 
since 2014.  Our cooperation led to the territorial defeat of the so-called 
“caliphate” earlier this year.  During this time, the United States and our Coalition 
 
partners provided assistance to restore essential services, support local security and 
governance, to alleviate humanitarian needs, and to help restore the local economy 
in areas liberated from ISIS.  These efforts helped meet basic needs and create an 
area of relative stability in Syria, and enable the enduring defeat of ISIS elements 
there. 
 
One longstanding issue in this campaign has been Turkey’s belief that there 
is no distinction between the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which both the 
United States and Turkey have designated as a terrorist organization, and the YPG 
and our partner the SDF.  Turkey thus views the YPG – a key component of the 
SDF – as an existential threat which receives support from the United States.  To 
Turkey, our cooperation with and support to any of these bodies is akin to 
supporting a statelet on its southern border run by a terrorist group it believes has 
declared war on Turkey.  The State Department has led efforts over the past year 
and a half to reduce that friction and achieve better coordination of U.S. and 
Turkish efforts regarding Syria.   
 
When President Trump announced a strong, deliberate and coordinated 
withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria in December 2018, the Administration said 
we were transitioning primary responsibility for the defeat of the few remaining 
ISIS remnants in Syria to our allies and partners on the ground inside Syria. 
 
Beginning in January 2019, the Administration worked with Turkey on 
implementing a safe zone in northeast Syria that would prevent the resurgence of 
ISIS, protect Turkish security interests vis-a-vis the SDF/YPG, facilitate 
stabilization, and create conditions to enable the safe, voluntary, dignified return of 
 
refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). 
 
This effort culminated in U.S.-Turkish military-to-military arrangement in 
August for a security mechanism; the SDF was informed and supported the 
elements of that arrangement.  The United States, Turkey, and the SDF all began 
executing the arrangement in late August.  We believe we very quickly 
implemented the initial steps of the arrangement to create an area along 
approximately 140 km of the border region in the northeast.  This included YPG 
voluntary withdrawal to approximately 5-14 km from the Turkish border of armed 
personnel generally, displacement of heavy weapons to 20 km from the Turkish 
border, U.S.-Turkish cooperation on Turkish air activity over northeast Syria, and 
joint U.S.-Turkish patrols in the relevant area. 
 
Turkey from President Erdogan on down disputed the conduct and 
implementation of security mechanism activities, but, more importantly, pressed 
beginning in early September for an entirely different concept – one Turkey had 
tried and failed to foist on the United States and, through us, the SDF since 
January:  a 32 kilometer zone to the key east-west highway, M4/10, along the 
entire northeast from the Euphrates to the Iraqi border, and sole Turkish military, 
as opposed to joint U.S.-Turkish engagement on area security.  Turkey also began 
stressing its desire to move up to four million Syrian refugees now in Turkey into 
cities to be constructed in the area, an initiative that went far beyond the scope of 
the military-to-military arrangement.  The United States at every level has 
underlined our resolute opposition to this plan as a threat to our SDF partners, the 
fight against ISIS elements, and overall security in Syria. 
 
 
Indications grew in September 2019 that Turkey was planning for a large-
scale unilateral operation.  Again, all levels of the U.S. government warned Turkey 
not to act. 
 
Erdogan, however, said that Turkey would soon move forward with its long-
planned operation into northern Syria.  He was told clearly, including by the 
President, that U.S. Armed Forces would not support or be involved, and that the 
United States does not endorse such actions, but that we would not put U.S. forces 
in harm’s way.  President Trump also publicly warned Turkey that the United 
States would take measures sanctioning the Turkish economy if Turkey were to 
take steps that the United States considers “off limits.” 
 
Turkey launched this operation despite our objections, undermining the D-
ISIS campaign, risking endangering and displacing civilians, destroying critical 
civilian infrastructure, and threatening the security of the area.  Turkey’s military 
actions have precipitated a humanitarian crisis and set conditions for possible war 
crimes.  As the President warned Erdogan, we have used diplomatic and economic 
tools available to us to press Turkey to halt its military actions. 
   
On October 14, President Trump signed an Executive Order designed to 
encourage Turkey to halt its offensive military action in northeast Syria and adopt 
a ceasefire.  It provides the United States with the authorities to deliver severe 
economic consequences and apply additional pressure if Turkey continues with 
this offensive.  The United States has imposed sanctions on three senior Turkish 
Government officials: Hulusi Akar, the Minister of National Defense; Suleyman 
Soylu, the Minister of the Interior; and Fatih Donmez, Minister of Energy, and on 
two ministries, Defense and Energy.  Turkey must follow through on its 
 
commitments from the October 17 Joint Statement with the United States to avoid 
further sanctions under this new E.O.   
 
The United States undertook various diplomatic initiatives to reinforce our 
sanctions, including a Presidential letter to President Erdogan on October 9 and a 
Presidential message to him three days later.  In the latter we warned the Turks that 
the SDF was likely to turn to Russia and the Assad regime if Turkey continued its 
offensive, which then occurred.  The President then dispatched the Vice President, 
Secretary Pompeo, and National Security Advisor O’Brien to Ankara to negotiate 
with Turkey the terms of a ceasefire and the YPG’s evacuation from affected areas.  
As I indicated already, on October 17 those talks, including five hours with 
President Erdogan, produced a Joint Statement outlining a pause that will lead to a 
ceasefire -- that Turkey and the YPG are adhering to – for 120 hours to allow the 
withdrawal of the YPG from the Turkish-controlled safe zone.  In return, the 
United States committed not to impose new sanctions under the October 14th E.O., 
“Blocking Property and Suspending Entry of Certain Persons Contributing to the 
Situation in Syria.”  Turkey has committed to a permanent ceasefire upon 
completion of the YPG withdrawal; in return, the United States would lift the 
sanctions now imposed under the E.O.  This solution will save lives and contribute 
to long-term stability in the region.   
Assuming the pause moves to such a longer-term halt, we will work with 
Turkey and local residents on the humanitarian and social commitments of the 
October 17 Joint Statement, cooperate with our local partners against ISIS even as 
the U.S. military continues the withdrawal directed by the President, and press for 
full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2254, the only hope for a 
long-term resolution of the underlying Syrian conflict.   
 
To these ends, we are looking to organize a number of senior level meetings 
with our international partners involved in the Defeat-ISIS Coalition as well as our 
Syria-focused group.  Our intent is to re-affirm with our Coalition partners the 
shared goals of ensuring that ISIS does not re-emerge.   
Thank you for the opportunity to testify.  I look forward to taking your 
questions.

STATEMENT OF 
CHAIRMAN AJIT PAI 
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 
HEARING ON OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION: 
SPECTRUM AUCTIONS PROGRAM 
BEFORE THE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT 
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
U.S. SENATE 
OCTOBER 17, 2019 
Chairman Kennedy, Ranking Member Coons, and Members of the Financial Services and 
General Government Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here to discuss the Federal 
Communications Commission’s spectrum auctions program.  
Good spectrum policy is critical to securing our nation’s position as the global leader in the 
deployment of 5G, the next generation of wireless technology.  In my testimony before this 
Subcommittee in May, I outlined the Commission’s three-pronged strategy for Facilitating America’s 
Superiority in 5G Technology—the 5G FAST Plan.  This plan calls for freeing up more spectrum for 
commercial use, making it easier to install wireless infrastructure, and modernizing our regulations to 
encourage the deployment of fiber.   
The FCC favors a market-based approach in order to make more spectrum available for 5G.  We 
have eschewed command-and-control, top-down mandates in favor of flexible use for wireless spectrum 
whenever feasible.  The free market best determines what technology should be deployed in what band, 
especially as the pace of technology accelerates more rapidly and demand for spectrum continues to grow.   
One important component of this market-based approach to spectrum policy is our spectrum 
auctions program.  As you know, Congress authorized the FCC to conduct spectrum auctions in the 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.  Since then, the Commission has conducted 93 spectrum auctions.  
Among other things, these spectrum auctions have been critical to the explosive growth in wireless 
communications over the last two-and-a-half decades.  For example, the AWS-1 and 700 MHz spectrum 
auctions conducted during the Bush Administration were critical to the United States leading the world in 
4G LTE deployment. 
The FCC’s spectrum auction program has also been good for our nation’s taxpayers.  Because of 
our spectrum auctions, the FCC is one of the few government agencies that generates more money for the 
U.S. Treasury that it spends.  Overall, the Commission’s spectrum auction program to date has generated 
$116.5 billion in revenue for the U.S. Treasury, with administrative and personnel costs constituting only 
1.7% of that amount.  Each year, Congress sets an auction spending cap for the FCC.  For FY 2019, that 
cap is $130,284,000.  And for FY 2020, both the House and Senate Subcommittee bills have set the FY 
2020 level at $132,538,680.  The Commission appreciates this Subcommittee’s financial support for the 
spectrum auctions program.    
With ever-increasing demand for and technological advances in spectrum use, spectrum policy is 
becoming more complicated.  That’s one reason why Congress provided the FCC in 2012 with incentive 
auction authority.  In 2017, the FCC concluded its first incentive auction, which provided payments to 
broadcast television stations that chose to relinquish their spectrum.  That auction ended up making 
available 70 megahertz of spectrum for mobile broadband use in the 600 MHz band.  It also generated 
about $19.3 billion in revenue.  About $10.05 billion of that money went to pay broadcasters that 
1 
 
relinquished their spectrum, more than $7 billion was directed to the U.S. Treasury for deficit reduction, 
and more than $2 billion is being spent to compensate broadcasters for their relocation costs as a result of 
the post-incentive auction spectrum repack.  I am pleased to report that the repack is going well.  Most 
broadcast television stations that need to be moved from their old frequencies have already done so.  The 
process for compensating stations for their relocation costs has been running smoothly.  And wireless 
carriers are already using much of the 600 MHz spectrum that they won at the auction to provide service 
across the country.  Looking forward, we’ll keep our eye on the ball and make sure that this repack is 
brought to a successful conclusion.  
  Recently, the Commission’s spectrum auction program has been very active as we move 
aggressively to make more spectrum available for 5G services.  On November 14, 2018, we began our 28 
GHz auction, which concluded on January 24, 2019.  It made available 850 megahertz of spectrum and 
raised over $700 million for the U.S. Treasury.  Overall, 33 bidders won a total of 2,965 licenses.  
Then, on March 14, 2019, we started our 24 GHz auction.  That auction ended on May 28, 2019 
and made available 700 megahertz of spectrum for the commercial marketplace.  It also raised over $2 
billion for the U.S. Treasury.  Overall, 29 bidders won a total of 2,904 licenses. 
Each of these auctions was successful, and combined, they pushed 1,550 megahertz of high-band 
spectrum into the commercial marketplace.  This spectrum will be critical to supporting the advanced 
high-bandwidth, ultra-low latency applications that will be made possible for 5G. 
But we can’t and won’t be complacent.  Indeed, we’ve already scheduled two more spectrum 
auctions that will begin within the next nine months.  On December 10, bidding will commence in what 
we are calling Auction 103.  This auction will make available more spectrum than any auction in 
American history.  3,400 megahertz of spectrum in the Upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands will 
be on the auction block.   
One notable feature of this auction is that we are making use of our incentive auction authority to 
reorganize the band.  But while the broadcast incentive auction used separate forward and reverse 
auctions, Auction 103 will use an innovative voucher system that will allow incumbents to receive 
payments for relinquishing their existing licenses or apply the value of their current licenses for new 
licenses won at the auction.  This creative solution illustrates why Congress’ decision to give the FCC 
flexibility in structuring auctions was a wise one. 
Following Auction 103, the FCC will turn to mid-band spectrum auctions.  Mid-band spectrum is 
important for 5G deployment because these bands combine good coverage with good capacity.  On June 
25, 2020, the FCC will start an auction of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band.  For this band, the Commission 
adopted an innovative regulatory regime for commercial use known as dynamic sharing.  We set up a 
three-tiered, hierarchical framework to coordinate shared federal and non-federal use.  Incumbents, which 
are federal users, comprise the highest tier and receive protection from all other users, followed by 
Priority Access Licenses (PALs) on the second tier, and General Authorized Access (GAA) on the third 
tier.  PALs receive protection from GAA operations and must accept interference from incumbents.  GAA 
is licensed-by-rule and must accept interference from all other users. 
Automated frequency coordinators, known as Spectrum Access Systems, will coordinate 
operations, and Environmental Sensing Capability operators will manage a sensor system designed to 
detect the presence of federal incumbent radar transmissions and communicate that information to the 
SASs.  Just last month, we authorized five such frequency coordinators so that initial commercial 
deployments could commence. 
Next June, we will start auctioning the PALs in the 3.5 GHz band.  Seven 10-megahertz channels 
will be made available, for a total of 70 megahertz of spectrum.  But while bidders will be paying for the 
right to use a 10-megehertz channel, they will not be bidding on a specific 10-megahertz channel.  Rather, 
the specific frequencies that they will be using will change periodically as a result of the dynamic 
2 
 
spectrum sharing described above.  A total of 22,631 PALs will be offered in this auction, which will be 
the most licenses ever offered in an FCC spectrum auction. 
Following the 3.5 GHz band auction, the FCC plans to hold an auction in the 2.5 GHz band.  
With almost 200 megahertz, the 2.5 GHz band is the largest contiguous band of terrestrial, flexible use 
spectrum below 3 GHz in the United States.  But that band is dramatically underused today—existing 
licenses cover only about one-half of the country, and the spectrum is barely assigned west of the 
Mississippi River.  In July, the FCC revised the rules for the band, allowing more entities to access the 
spectrum and eliminating unnecessary restrictions.  The Commission will soon open a Tribal priority 
window to give Tribes an opportunity to obtain this spectrum to provide wireless services on rural Tribal 
lands.  Following this window, we will hold an auction to assign the remaining unused portions of the 
band for commercial use.  We have not yet scheduled a start date for this auction, but my goal is for it to 
begin next year. 
Finally, I would like to conclude by discussing a relatively recent change to the Commission’s 
management of its spectrum auction program.  Until late last year, the program was run by the Auctions 
Division of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau.  But auctions aren’t limited to the wireless space.  
The Commission also auctions spectrum for broadcast radio and television licenses.  This summer, for 
example, we held an auction for FM translator licenses.  And the Commission now holds reverse auctions 
of universal service support to promote rural broadband deployment.  In 2018, for example, we held the 
Connect America Fund Phase II reverse auction, which allocated almost $1.5 billion to deploy broadband 
to over 713,000 homes and businesses in rural America.  Next year, we intend to launch the Rural Digital 
Opportunity Fund, which will allocate over $20 billion for rural broadband deployment using a reverse 
auction format.  And in December of this year, the Commission will hold an auction of new toll-free 
numbers.  
In light of the Commission’s increasingly diverse auctions portfolio, it no longer made sense for 
the Auctions Division to remain under the purview of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau.  So 
when we created the new Office of Economics and Analytics, we decided to move the Auctions Division 
there.  This was a good fit because good auction design must be based on sound economics.  I am pleased 
to report that this transition has been smooth and, as evidenced by the Commission’s busy auctions 
schedule, has not disrupted our important auctions work.

STATEMENT OF CARL E. BURLESON,  
ACTING DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR, FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION 
BEFORE THE  
UNITED STATES SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON 
TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT,  
AND RELATED AGENCIES: 
OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, 
JULY 31, 2019 
 
Chairman Collins, Ranking Member Reed, Members of the Subcommittee: 
  Thank you for inviting me to speak with you today to update you on the Federal Aviation 
Administration’s (FAA) work to fulfill its mission to provide the safest, most efficient airspace 
system in the world.  The FAA is committed to advancing the Administration’s and the Department 
of Transportation’s priorities of creating stronger infrastructure that supports a growing economy 
and continuing American leadership in innovation while maintaining safety and access for all users 
of the National Airspace System (NAS).  Our employees are working diligently to accomplish the 
directives Congress set forth in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 and the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2019, which together provide a reliable foundation for the FAA to achieve 
these objectives.  Accompanying me today are Ali Bahrami, Associate Administrator for Aviation 
Safety; Angela H. Stubblefield, Deputy Associate Administrator for Security and Hazardous 
Materials Safety; and Winsome Lenfert, Deputy Associate Administrator for Airports.  With their 
help, I would like to highlight for you some of our activities in these specific areas: aviation safety, 
unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) integration, and airports and infrastructure. 
Aviation Safety 
Safety is the core of the Federal Aviation Administration’s mission and our top priority.  
With the support of this Committee, we have worked tirelessly to take a more proactive, data-
driven approach to oversight that prioritizes safety above all else inside the FAA and within the 
1 
 
 
aviation community that we regulate.  The result of this approach is that the United States has the 
safest air transportation system in the world.  Since 1997, the risk of a fatal commercial aviation 
accident in the United States has been cut by 94 percent.  With respect to commercial space 
transportation, since 1995, there have been a total of 388 licensed or permitted launches and 
reentries (19 so far in 2019), all without any fatalities, serious injuries, or significant property 
damage to the general public.  In the past ten years, there has been one passenger fatality on a 
U.S. commercial airline in over 90 million flights.  But one fatality is one too many, and a 
healthy safety culture requires continuous attention and commitment to continuous improvement. 
In order to maintain the safest air transportation system in the world, the FAA has 
evolved from a prescriptive and more reactive approach to its safety oversight responsibilities to 
one that is performance-based, proactive, centered on managing risk, and focused on continuous 
improvement.  This approach to safety oversight relies on access to data and requires the open 
and transparent exchange of information.  We know that it takes collaboration, communication, 
and common safety objectives to allow the FAA and the aviation community to identify system 
hazards and to implement safety solutions.  This approach gives us knowledge that we would not 
otherwise have about safety events and risks.  Sharing safety issues, trends, and lessons learned 
is critical to recognizing potential risks in the system.  The more data we have, the more we can 
learn about the system, which in turn allows us to better manage and improve the system.   
The FAA’s grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX airplane placed a spotlight on safety and 
our approach to oversight of those we regulate.  With respect to the certification of the 
737 MAX, the facts are these: it took five years to certify the 737 MAX.  Boeing applied for 
certification in January 2012. The certification was completed in March 2017.  During those five 
years, FAA safety engineers and test pilots put in 110,000 hours of work, and they flew or 
2 
 
 
supported 297 test flights.  After certification of an aircraft design, the FAA continues to oversee 
the aircraft’s production and operation.  As we obtain pertinent information, identify potential 
risk, or learn of a system failure, we analyze it, determine how best to mitigate the risk, and 
require operators to implement the mitigation.   
This approach to safety and fact-based, data-driven decision making has been the FAA’s 
guiding principle in our response to the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents.  Once the 
FAA had data showing similarities between the two accidents that warranted further 
investigation of the possibility of a shared cause, the FAA made the decision to ground all 
737 MAX airplanes operated by U.S. airlines or in U.S. territory pending further investigation.   
As part of the FAA’s commitment to continuous improvement, we both welcome and 
invite review of our processes and procedures.  A number of reviews and audits have been 
initiated to look at different aspects of the 737 MAX certification.  After the FAA grounded the 
737 MAX, Secretary Chao asked the Department of Transportation’s Inspector General to 
conduct an audit of the certification for the 737 MAX, with the goal of compiling an objective 
and detailed factual history of the activities that resulted in the certification of the 737 MAX 
aircraft.  Secretary Chao also announced the establishment of a Special Committee to review the 
FAA’s procedures for the certification of new aircraft, including the 737 MAX.  The Special 
Committee to Review FAA’s Aircraft Certification Process is an independent body whose 
findings and recommendations will be presented directly to the Secretary and the FAA 
Administrator.  
  The FAA also established a Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR) to conduct a 
comprehensive review of the certification of the automated flight control system on the Boeing 
737 MAX.  The JATR is chaired by former NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart and comprises a 
3 
 
 
team of experts from the FAA, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the 
aviation authorities of Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Indonesia, Japan, 
Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates.  Completion of the JATR’s work is not a prerequisite 
for returning the 737 MAX to service; however, the FAA will consider the findings and 
recommendations of each of the participants as we continually review our processes. 
Additionally, the FAA met with safety representatives of the three U.S.-based 
commercial airlines that have the Boeing 737 MAX in their fleets, as well as the pilot unions for 
those airlines.  This meeting was an opportunity for the FAA to hear individual views from 
operators and pilots of the 737 MAX as the agency evaluates what needs to be done before the 
FAA makes a decision to return the aircraft to service in the United States.  In keeping with the 
FAA’s longstanding cooperation with its international partners, the FAA also recently hosted a 
meeting of Directors General of civil aviation authorities from around the world to discuss the 
FAA’s activities toward ensuring the safe return of the 737 MAX to service.  We continue to be 
in frequent communication with the international aviation safety community and are working 
closely with our counterparts to address their concerns and keep them informed of progress. 
The FAA also initiated a multi-agency Technical Advisory Board (TAB) review of 
Boeing’s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) software update and 
system safety assessment in order to determine sufficiency.  The TAB consists of a team of 
experts from the U.S. Air Force, NASA, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, and the 
FAA.  None of the TAB experts have been involved in any aspect of the Boeing 737 MAX 
certification.  The TAB is charged with evaluating Boeing and FAA efforts related to the 
software update and its integration into the flight control system.  The TAB will identify issues 
where further investigation is required prior to approval of the design change.  The JATR is 
4 
 
 
looking broadly at the original certification of the 737 MAX flight control system, while the 
TAB is evaluating Boeing’s proposed technical solutions related to the two accidents.  The 
TAB’s recommendations will directly inform the FAA’s decision concerning the 737 MAX 
fleet’s return to service.  
The FAA is following a thorough process, not a prescribed timeline, for returning the 
737 MAX to passenger service.  We continue to evaluate Boeing’s software modification to the 
MCAS, and we are still developing necessary training requirements.  The 737 MAX will not 
return to service for U.S. carriers and in U.S. airspace until the FAA’s analysis of the facts and 
technical data indicate that it is safe to do so. 
UAS Integration 
The FAA’s commitment to global leadership in aviation is equally evident in the area of 
UAS integration.  The steady development and expansion of UAS has created a dynamic change 
in aviation that we have not seen since the dawn of the jet age.  The FAA is committed to 
supporting this change and to working with the UAS community to ensure that this technology is 
integrated into the NAS safely and securely.  UAS offer expanded capabilities in aviation with a 
fast pace of innovation and increasing volume of operations.  For example, the progression of 
UAS innovation and the change in product cycles can generally be measured in months, not 
years.  Similarly, the volume of UAS operations is outpacing manned aircraft.  Currently, there 
are nearly four times as many UAS as registered manned aircraft.   
The new dynamics that UAS bring to the NAS redouble our focus on the safety of all 
aircraft operations as the FAA’s first priority.  An ongoing challenge to UAS integration is the 
potential for conflict between manned and unmanned aircraft.  We continue to engage in 
outreach to UAS operators and the public at large to educate current and prospective drone users 
5 
 
 
about their safety responsibilities.  Efforts such as the “Know Before You Fly” information 
campaign have encouraged UAS operators to understand the rules and responsibilities for flying 
an aircraft in the NAS.  This campaign and the FAA’s related work on the “B4UFLY” mobile 
application are bearing fruit.  The annual rate of increase of pilot reports about UAS operating in 
places where they should not be is dropping by 50 percent each year—while the number of UAS 
operating in the airspace is increasing.   
The UAS Integration Pilot Program (IPP)1 also has been a crucial step in accelerating the 
Department of Transportation’s and FAA’s UAS integration efforts.  Through the IPP, nine 
different communities across the country are working to identify ways to balance local and 
national interests.  The IPP is a case study in communications, security, privacy, and data 
collection.  The experience gained and the data collected from the IPP will help ensure the 
United States remains the global leader in safe UAS integration and fully realizes the economic 
and societal benefits of this technology.  In fact, the IPP is already paying dividends on the 
investment.  Recently, the FAA granted the first air carrier certification to a commercial drone 
operator for package deliveries in rural Blacksburg, Virginia.  Although the regulatory 
framework for broader drone operations is not complete, the IPP has helped to inform the FAA 
and drone operators of the extent to which operations can begin under existing rules. 
UAS Rulemaking 
The FAA currently is enabling safe UAS operations using existing rules, but we also 
understand the need to focus on enabling an ever-expanding universe of UAS operations and 
capabilities.  In order to allow for such operations to be conducted safely and securely, the FAA 
has moved forward with a number of regulatory initiatives.  Together with the Department of

Transportation’s Office of the Secretary, the FAA recently published a proposed new rule on the 
operation of small UAS over people.2  The proposal seeks to mitigate safety risks without 
inhibiting technological and operational advances.  The FAA also recently published an 
advanced notice of proposed rulemaking seeking public input to identify drone safety and 
security issues and explore ways to mitigate risks UAS may pose to other aircraft, people on the 
ground, or to national security.3  The FAA’s security partners have helped to highlight some of 
the important security and public safety questions that must be addressed.   
Additionally, in February 2019, the FAA published an interim final rule on external 
marking requirements for small UAS.4  The rule requires small unmanned aircraft owners to 
display their unique identifier (registration number) on an external surface of the aircraft.  
Identifiers are assigned by the FAA upon completion of the registration process.  Small 
unmanned aircraft owners are no longer permitted to enclose the FAA-issued registration number 
in a compartment.  The FAA took this action to address concerns expressed by the law 
enforcement community and the FAA’s interagency security partners regarding the risk a 
concealed explosive device poses to first responders who must open a compartment to attempt to 
find the small unmanned aircraft's registration number.  
UAS Remote Identification 
Going forward, the ability to remotely identify UAS operators will be a crucial stepping 
stone for UAS traffic management and will facilitate what we envision as high volume, safe, and

secure low-altitude UAS operations.  Congress recognized the importance of remote 
identification when it enacted the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016.  That Act 
laid the foundation for FAA’s work with operators and our security partners to realize the 
importance of remote identification and to reach a consensus on how to address it.  More 
recently, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 provided the FAA with additional authority to 
move ahead with work on universal registration and remote identification—both of which are 
critical to the success of commercial UAS operations and UAS integration more broadly.   
Remote identification is fundamental to both safety and security of drone operations.  
Remote identification will be necessary for routine beyond visual line-of-sight operations and 
operations over people, package delivery, operations in congested areas, and the continued safe 
operation of all aircraft in shared airspace.  It will also be foundational for the advancement of 
automated passenger or cargo-carrying air transportation—what is often referred to as Urban Air 
Mobility.  From a security perspective, remote identification would enable us to connect a 
suspect UAS to its control station location and to identify the registered owner of a suspect UAS.  
With universal remote identification, the FAA, our national security partners, and state and local 
law enforcement will be better able to locate and identify a UAS operator, determine if a UAS is 
being operated in an unsafe, unauthorized, or criminal manner, and take appropriate action if 
necessary.  The FAA is committed to establishing remote identification requirements as quickly 
as possible.   
UAS and the Airport Environment 
With the December 2018 protracted UAS disruption at Gatwick Airport, and other 
reported disruptions at airports around the world and in the United States, the FAA understands 
and shares the concerns of airlines, airport sponsors, and our security partners regarding the 
8 
 
 
potential safety hazards and security threats presented by errant or malicious UAS, particularly in 
and around the airport environment.  A number of airport sponsors have acquired or are pursuing 
possible acquisition of UAS detection systems for their airports.  In an effort to make sure such 
activity is conducted in a safe and coordinated manner, in early May, the FAA sent informational 
correspondence to airport sponsors, which included information to support informed airport 
decision-making regarding the demonstration or installation of UAS detection systems at airports 
(including the legal uncertainties posed by certain UAS detection systems), answers to some 
frequently asked questions, and technical considerations that the FAA has used to assess the 
readiness of UAS detection technologies.5  The FAA wants to coordinate with airports that plan 
to use UAS detection systems to ensure deployment and use do not create interference or 
obstruction with other aviation safety and efficiency systems.  
  Given the events in Gatwick, there is no doubt about the significant operational and 
economic impacts a persistent UAS disruption can have in the airport environment and the need 
to be able not only to detect, identify, and track a disruptive UAS, but also to be able to take 
action to end the disruption.  The FAA along with our federal security partners have formulated a 
concept of operations (CONOPS) for a National Federal Response plan through which current 
federal counter-UAS (C-UAS) authorities and existing federal C-UAS equipment can be rapidly 
projected into a major U.S. airport experiencing a persistent operational disruption due to an 
unauthorized UAS operation.  This CONOPS has been socialized with airport and airline 
associations and should be finalized for implementation soon.

Airports and Infrastructure 
  Airport infrastructure in the United States, with 3,332 airports and 5,000 paved runways, 
supports our economic competitiveness and improves the safety and efficiency of our air 
transportation system.  According to the FAA’s most recent economic analysis, U.S. civil 
aviation accounts for $1.6 trillion in total economic activity and supports nearly 11 million jobs.  
The FAA’s Office of Airports provides leadership in maintaining a safe, secure, efficient, 
environmentally sustainable, and fiscally responsible system of airports.  Under Secretary Chao’s 
leadership, the Department of Transportation and the FAA are delivering Airport Improvement 
Program (AIP) investments for the American people, who depend on reliable infrastructure.  The 
FAA is also helping to streamline non-aeronautical development at airports and is increasing 
airport safety by addressing runway incursions and improving runway safety areas (RSA). 
AIP Investments 
Through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Congress provided an additional  
$1 million in supplemental funding for infrastructure grants.  The FAA published a Federal 
Register notice on July 9, 20186, explaining the evaluation criteria and submission process for 
supplemental discretionary funding requests.  The requirements under the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2018 included: requiring the FAA to give “priority consideration” to specific 
types of airports (smaller and more rural airports); for non-primary airports, there is no local 
match required for the work covered by the grant; and requiring the FAA to obligate the 
supplemental funding by September 2020.  After the FAA awarded an initial round of $205 
million to 37 airports in 34 states in September 2018, airports in October 2018 submitted

improvement-program-aip-for-fiscal-years-2018-2020 
10 
 
 
additional funding requests for grant awards in fiscal years (FY) 2019 or 2020.  This project 
solicitation resulted in requests totaling $10.9 billion in funding. 
On May 15, 2019, Secretary Chao announced the intent to award another $779 million in 
supplemental funding for infrastructure grants to 127 airports in all 50 states and Puerto Rico.  
This represented the final round of grants awarded under the supplemental funding provided in 
the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018.  Overall, about 88% of the supplemental funds went 
to airports meeting the statutory criteria for “Priority Consideration” and more than $430 million 
went to non-primary airports.  Recipients of the selected grants will still need to meet any 
remaining required approvals.  Selected projects include runway reconstruction and 
rehabilitation, as well as new construction or rehabilitation of taxiways, aprons, and terminals.  
The construction and equipment supported by this funding increase airports’ safety, emergency 
response capabilities, and capacity, and could support further potential growth and development 
within each airport’s region.  The FAA is currently working through the normal Airports Capital 
Improvement Plan (ACIP) process to identify and evaluate potential projects for the $500 million 
in supplemental funds appropriated in FY 2019.     
With regard to the total $3.18 billion in regular FY 2019 AIP funding for airports across 
the United States, Secretary Chao has announced three allotments totaling almost $1.8 billion in 
grants awarded for over 900 airports.  Some notable examples of the grant awards include: 
$11 million for reconstruction of Runway 5/23 and mitigation of factors contributing to runway 
incursions in Des Moines, Iowa; $10.4 million for construction of an aircraft rescue and 
firefighting building and acquisition of two aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicles to enhance 
airport safety in Birmingham, Alabama; $3.1 million for runway rehabilitation in Charleston, 
West Virginia; $2.7 million for mitigation of airport noise in New Haven and East Haven, 
11 
 
 
Connecticut; and $2 million for rehabilitation of a general aviation apron used for aircraft 
parking in Helena, Montana. 
Streamlining Certain Types of Development 
  The Department of Transportation and the FAA are also working to streamline project 
reviews and remove unnecessary barriers to development.  Section 163 of the FAA 
Reauthorization Act of 2018 provided a framework for the FAA to determine that certain types 
of proposed development projects no longer trigger a need for formal FAA review and approval.  
To date, the FAA has received over 40 requests for determinations under section 163 and has 
issued 25 determinations.  Some examples of projects receiving determinations under section 
163 are the sale of 11.8 acres of airport land for development of a $37 million facility in the 
Purdue University-affiliated Discovery Park District in Lafayette, Indiana; and the long-term 
lease and construction of industrial warehouse flex facilities on 27 acres of land acquired with 
Airport Development Aid Program7 funds in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Because formal FAA 
review and approval is not required for these projects, they may be able to begin construction 
more quickly. 
Airport Safety 
The FAA also is engaged in several successful efforts to improve safety at our nation’s 
airports.  Runway incursions, which include wrong runway landings and takeoffs, are a top 
airport safety concern for the FAA.  Research has shown that airport geometry can contribute to 
runway incursions.  As a result, the FAA has provided airports with updated guidance on 
recommended taxiway layouts.8

Incursion Prevention into Taxiway and Apron Design” available at www.faa.gov/airports/resources/. 
12 
 
 
A research study conducted in FY 2012 identified 140 locations with nonstandard 
geometry and a high incidence of runway incursions using data from FY 2008 through FY 2012.  
As a result, the FAA launched the Runway Incursion Mitigation (RIM) program in FY 2015 to 
help mitigate the nonstandard geometry at these locations and ultimately reduce the number of 
runway incursions.  The FAA maintains a RIM database, which is updated annually with new 
data.   
Currently, there are 128 RIM locations at 77 airports.  Airports can utilize a variety of 
mitigation strategies to eliminate nonstandard geometry configurations and reduce the likelihood 
of pilot confusion and ultimately, runway incursions.  Airports often use a combination of 
mitigation strategies for RIM locations, which can include changes to airport geometry, lights, 
signs, markings, and/or operational procedures.  
To date, 39 locations have been mitigated through the RIM program, including Santa 
Barbara Municipal Airport, Corpus Christi International Airport, and Albuquerque International 
Airport.  Before mitigation, these 39 locations experienced 435 runway incursions, compared to 
30 runway incursions after mitigation.  The RIM locations will be monitored over time to 
determine if mitigation efforts were successful and whether or not additional mitigation is 
needed. 
The FAA has also worked to mitigate the impacts of runway excursions—incidents 
where an aircraft overruns, undershoots, or veers off the side of a runway—by improving RSA at 
commercial service airports.  The RSA is typically 500 feet wide and extends 1,000 feet beyond 
each end of the runway.  Many airports were built before the current 1,000-foot RSA standard 
was adopted approximately 20 years ago.  In some cases, it is not practicable to achieve the full 
13 
 
 
standard RSA because there may be a lack of available land.  There also may be obstacles such 
as bodies of water, highways, railroads, and populated areas or severe drop-off of terrain. 
The FAA began conducting research in the 1990s to determine how to improve safety at 
airports where the full RSA cannot be obtained.  Working in concert with the University of 
Dayton, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the Engineered Arresting Systems 
Corporation (ESCO) of Logan Township, NJ, a new technology emerged to safely stop 
overrunning aircraft.  Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS) uses crushable material 
placed at the end of a runway to stop an aircraft that overruns the runway.  The tires of the 
aircraft sink into the lightweight material and the aircraft is decelerated as it rolls through the 
material. 
The EMAS technology improves safety benefits in cases where land is not available, or 
not possible to have the standard 1,000-foot overrun.  A standard EMAS installation can stop an 
aircraft from overrunning the runway at approximately 80 miles per hour.  An EMAS arrestor 
bed can be installed to help slow or stop an aircraft that overruns the runway, even if less than a 
standard RSA length is available. 
As of October 2014, there are two manufacturers of EMAS products that meet the FAA 
requirements of advisory circular 150-5220-22B, “Engineered Materials Arresting Systems for 
Aircraft Overruns”—ESCO and Runway Safe.  The FAA must review and approve each EMAS 
installation.  Currently, ESCO’s EMAS is installed on 112 runway ends at 68 U.S. airports, with 
plans to install 3 EMAS at 2 additional U.S. airports.  Runway Safe’s EMAS is installed on four 
runway ends at Chicago Midway Airport.  To date, there have been 15 incidents where ESCO’s 
EMAS has safely stopped overrunning aircraft with a total of 406 crew and passengers aboard 
those flights.   
14 
 
 
EMAS and other RSA improvements have minimized adverse impacts otherwise 
resulting from runway excursions.  For example, in July 2013, Asiana Airlines Flight 214 landed 
short on Runway 28L at San Francisco International Airport.  Although the aircraft sustained 
severe damage and three people died, everyone else on board the aircraft survived, with many 
being able to walk away, due to an RSA improvement that provided the standard 600’ of 
available “undershoot” before the runway.  Had it not been for this enhancement, the aircraft 
would have landed short in San Francisco Bay.  And in March 2017, a McDonnell Douglas 
MD83 aircraft carrying the University of Michigan Men’s Basketball Team overran Runway 23L 
during a rejected take-off at Detroit Willow Run Airport, and entered an RSA that had been 
improved to meet current standards.  Although there was damage to the aircraft, there was only 
one minor injury reported. 
Conclusion 
  In this age of innovation that is reshaping the NAS, the pace of technological change is 
nothing short of amazing.  What has not changed, however, is the FAA’s focus on safety.  It is our 
number one priority and the foundation for everything that we do.  The United States is the gold 
standard in aviation safety and the FAA is committed to maintaining that standard.  In our quest 
for continuous safety improvement, we welcome external review of our systems, processes, and 
recommendations.    We  are  confident,  with  the  support  of  this  Committee  and  the  robust 
engagement of our stakeholders, we can innovate safely and continue to solidify America’s role 
as the global leader in aviation. 
  This concludes my statement.  I will be happy to answer your questions.

 STATEMENT OF DAVID BERNHARDT 
SECRETARY OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR  
BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES 
SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS  
ON THE PRESIDENT’S 2020 BUDGET REQUEST   
MAY 22, 2019 
 
Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Udall, and Members of the Subcommittee, I appear 
before you today to discuss the President’s 2020 Budget Request for the Department of the 
Interior.  Interior’s 2020 budget totals $12.6 billion, of which $11.5 billion supports activities 
within the jurisdiction of this Subcommittee.  The 2020 request reflects the Administration’s 
support for Interior’s important missions and is $926.2 million above the President’s 2019 
request for Interior.  Thanks to the work of this Subcommittee, in fiscal year 2020 Interior will 
have access to additional funding in the event of a severe wildland fire season, through disaster 
cap authority.   
2020 BUDGET PRIORITIES 
 
Interior’s 2020 budget reflects the Administration’s effort to strike the right balance of protection 
and sustainable use of resources in a way that provides proper conservation stewardship of our 
land and resources, enhances the safety of our communities, increases energy security, and 
allows America to prosper within our budgetary parameters.  The budget invests to grow jobs 
and prosperity, promote safe and secure communities, strengthen America’s energy security, 
meet Interior’s Trust responsibilities, and continue to reorganize the Department of the Interior.   
 
At the same time, this budget meets the Administration’s broader economic objective to manage 
Federal spending with restraint.  We’ve focused our resources to take care of the assets we have, 
expand public access to our lands, and invest where Interior can make a significant contribution 
to national objectives. 
 
Complementing our funding request, the President’s 2020 budget request features two significant 
legislative proposals to address wildfire risk through forest management reforms, and to rebuild 
America’s public lands infrastructure.   
 
PROMOTING JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH 
 
The Administration is committed to economic growth and prosperity.  The2020 budget supports 
working lands, good-paying American jobs, common sense regulatory reform, expanded 
opportunities for the outdoor recreation economy, and increased revenue to States, Tribes, and 
local communities.  Interior balances access for Americans to enjoy their public lands, managing 
these special places and natural resources for generations to come and the development needed to 
serve the public and fuel local economies. 
 
Of Interior’s $12.6 billion 2020 budget request, $4.9 billion supports the land management 
activities of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the National Park Service (NPS), and the 
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).  These operating funds support the primary activities to meet 
the unique resource mission of each bureau.  This funding supports resource development, day-
1 
to-day operations, and conservation stewardship activities for Interior’s great places; and fulfills 
the Department’s Federal wildlife responsibilities.   
 
America’s Federal lands and waters contain tremendous job-creating assets, supporting more 
than 1.8 million jobs in energy, recreation, grazing, conservation, and hospitality.  The 
stewardship of these resources and partnerships with communities bordering the public lands 
drive job opportunities and economic growth. 
 
Interior’s resource management programs directly support important jobs across America.  The 
budget invests $92.0 million in the BLM Rangeland Management program, which supports 
western ranching families, by managing nearly 18,000 livestock grazing permits and leases on 
the public lands.  The BLM public domain forestry and Oregon and California grant lands 
programs support jobs and local economies through timber and timber product sales.  The 2020 
budget includes $107.2 million for these programs to support timber sales and forest 
management projects.  Consistent with the targets established under Executive Order 13855, the 
request supports an estimated 280 million board feet in timber sales in 2021, continuing annual 
increases from the 2018 production level of 226 million board feet.   
 
The 2020 budget includes $12.3 million for BLM’s Other Mineral Resources Management 
program which manages development of leasable minerals.  Funding in 2020 will be used to 
streamline program activities, expedite processing of applications, and facilitate more timely 
inspection and enforcement actions. 
 
The U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) mineral resources program works to understand the 
fundamental science and identify supplies of mineral resources to support land use decisions 
across the United States.  This program directly supports the Administration’s efforts to 
strengthen America’s energy and critical minerals security as outlined in Executive Order 13817.  
The program is working to identify domestic supplies of 35 critical minerals needed for 
manufacturing and technology innovation.  The 2020 budget for the USGS includes $30.3 
million for critical minerals work.  This investment will provide the advanced topographic, 
geologic, and geophysical data needed to locate U.S. critical mineral resources to inform 
management of private-sector domestic development, reduce dependence on foreign sources, and 
support job creation and technological innovation. 
 
To increase U.S. economic strength, the Administration has challenged Federal agencies to 
reduce the regulatory burden on Americans.  We are working to ensure our regulations reflect 
advances in science and technology and foster innovation and economic growth.  We have also 
established standard goals to reduce page length and review times, internal processes, and 
applied project management practices to improve Interior’s National Environmental Policy Act 
review and clearance activities.  As part of this effort, we are also working to revise outdated 
processes and leverage technology to deliver better service.  The 2020 budget invests in 
improvements to make it easier to do business with Interior, including more timely processing of 
coal, oil and gas, grazing management, communications infrastructure, and surface mining 
reclamation plan reviews.  
 
2 
Our efforts to improve Interior’s review and permitting activities directly contribute to a stronger 
infrastructure in the United States.  Interior reviews and approves permits for Federal and private 
sector uses of Interior lands, including energy and minerals development, pipelines, and 
transmission infrastructure.  The 2020 budget requests $107.5 million for planning and 
consultation, which includes support for the FWS to perform reviews required under Section 7 of 
the Endangered Species Act and thereby avoid unnecessary delays in Federal infrastructure 
projects. 
 
Investment in Interior’s infrastructure also benefits local economies.  Interior’s infrastructure 
crisscrosses the country in roughly 2,400 locations.  In many communities our operations are a 
major economic driver.  Interior owns approximately 43,000 buildings, 106,000 miles of road, 
and 77,000 structures—including dams, schools, laboratories, employee housing, and irrigation 
and power infrastructure.  Many of these assets are deteriorating.  In 2018, Interior’s deferred 
maintenance backlog was over $18 billion, of which nearly $12 billion is associated with NPS 
assets.  The 2020 budget invests $1.5 billion across Interior for infrastructure maintenance and 
construction to care for our assets.  This includes $639.8 million for NPS construction and 
maintenance.  Complementing the request is proposed legislation to establish a Public Lands 
Infrastructure Fund, setting aside up to $1.3 billion a year, $6.5 billion over 5 years, from 50 
percent of energy development revenue that would otherwise be credited or deposited as 
miscellaneous receipts to the Treasury.  Within Interior, the Fund would be available for 
infrastructure needs in NPS, FWS, the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), and BLM.   
 
According to the U.S. Commerce Department, in 2016, America’s outdoor economy accounted 
for $412 billion of the U.S. GDP.  Interior plays a major role in supporting America’s outdoor 
economy through access to our public lands.  Every year, hundreds of millions of visits are made 
to our national parks, national wildlife refuges, and BLM public lands to do everything from 
rock climb, kayak and camp to snorkel, hunt, and fish.  Recreation visits to BLM and NPS lands 
alone support more than 350,000 jobs.  
 
Increasing recreational opportunities for more Americans through our public lands and waters 
also brings more economic opportunity for our neighboring gateway communities.  Increased 
public access to America’s lands is among our highest priorities.  The budget for our primary 
land management bureaus includes roughly $970.9 million for recreation and public access 
programs to increase the public’s enjoyment of Interior’s unique resources.  In FWS, this request 
supports safe and reliable access to outdoor recreation for over 55 million visitors to the national 
wildlife refuges.  The refuge system has more than 377 units that offer high-quality hunting 
opportunities and 312 units that are open to fishing.  These activities, along with special events 
and outdoor education programs, annually generate $2.4 billion in economic activity and support 
more than 35,000 jobs.  The 2020 budget includes $9.1 million for FWS to improve trails, open 
new areas to hunting, fishing and other recreation, increase awareness through updated web sites 
and recreation maps, and deliver engaging environmental education programs at the refuges.  
 
In 2018, the 418 units of the national park system hosted over 318 million visitors.  The 2020 
request for NPS includes $237.1 million for Visitor Services to support informative 
programming, concession management, and other activities to enhance the visitor experience.  
The budget invests $10.0 million to expand outdoor recreation opportunities including fishing 
3 
programs for youth and other novice anglers, improve recreational related infrastructure and 
resources, and coordinate with State, local, business, and nonprofit stakeholders to increase 
access to outdoor recreation.  
 
Responsible stewardship also means being a good neighbor.  The 2020 budget maintains the 
Administration’s continuing support for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, recognizing the 
inability of local communities to collect property taxes on certain Federal lands in their 
jurisdiction.  In 2018, Interior made payments to over 1,900 local governments across the United 
States.  Communities traditionally use these payments to help deliver vital services such as 
firefighting and police protection, construction of public schools and roads, and search-and-
rescue operations.  The 2020 budget includes $465.0 million in direct appropriations to support 
these payments.  
 
COLLABORATIVE CONSERVATION OF WILDLIFE, HABITAT AND CULTURAL RESOURCES 
 
Conservation stewardship is a key component of Interior’s overall mission and is shared across 
all bureaus.  Whether implementing resource conservation projects, providing grants, scientific 
expertise, or educational programs to support land, water, and wildlife conservation, Interior is a 
leader in protecting and managing America’s resources for current and future generations to 
enjoy.  The Department’s conservation efforts would not be possible without our partners across 
America.   
 
Our partners include the sportsmen and sportswomen who live America’s conservation ethic.  
They volunteer and frequently provide private and partnership resources to care for wildlife 
habitat, species management, and collaborative conservation.  Through the Pittman-Robertson 
and Dingell-Johnson Act programs, sportsmen and sportswomen contribute over a billion dollars 
each year to wildlife and habitat conservation and outdoor recreation projects.  Every time a 
firearm, fishing rod, hook, bullet, motor boat or boat fuel is sold, part of that cost goes to fund 
conservation.   
 
Increased access to hunting and fishing on public lands not only supports the outdoor economy 
but it actively supports conservation of these lands.  Sportsmen and sportswomen also help to 
leverage roughly two to one the Federal contribution for Interior’s North American Wetlands 
Conservation Act Grants.  The 2020 budget includes $40 million for these grants, which support 
projects to improve the health of wetlands, support migratory birds, and enhance nearby water 
quality.  The 2020 budget also includes $31.3 million for State and Tribal Wildlife Grants 
supporting State and Tribal projects to benefit local wildlife and their habitats through planning 
and restoration.  
 
The 2020 budget prioritizes partnerships, species recovery, and proactive wildlife and habitat 
conservation to avoid species from becoming endangered.  The budget includes $95.0 million to 
recover listed species, and $26.4 million for a range of proactive species and habitat specific 
conservation and restoration programs to avoid the need to list species.  The $67.8 million 
request for FWS Habitat Conservation features $54.4 million for the Partners for Fish and 
Wildlife Program, which leverages the Federal investment for conservation projects with local 
non-Federal partners all across the country.    
4 
 
BLM’s multiple use mission enables work, such as grazing, to continue on the public lands, but 
also ensures conservation of many species and their habitats – safeguarding the Nation’s public 
lands as well as peoples’ livelihoods.  BLM manages more wildlife habitat acreage than any 
other Federal agency—supporting conservation efforts for 3,000 species and preserving and 
restoring essential habitat for 430 threatened or endangered species.  The 2020 BLM budget 
includes $118.4 million for Wildlife and Habitat Management.  Management activities benefit 
native prairie, wildlife, and livestock, and help stabilize soils, maintain and improve water 
quality, reduce surface runoff and control flooding, improve ecological site conditions, and 
enhance overall environmental well-being. 
 
Habitat corridors are a feature of many of the tracts of land managed by BLM and are important 
for migrating wildlife.  The Department is working with States to research and protect the 
migration corridors of some of North America’s most iconic big-game species by protecting the 
range of moose, mule deer, elk, pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep, and other species who share 
the ecosystem benefit.  The 2020 budget invests $18.4 million across Interior to continue to 
support and expand migration corridor partnerships and conservation opportunities. 
 
America relies on the NPS to protect and maintain the natural beauty of the parks’ iconic 
landscapes as well as the artifacts and structures which help tell America’s history.  The $2.4 
billion request for national park operations includes $321.6 million for natural and cultural 
resource stewardship across the parks.  The FWS mission focuses on the conservation, 
protection, and enhancement of wildlife and their habitats.  The 2020 FWS budget includes 
$234.4 million for Wildlife and Habitat Management in the national refuge system. 
 
USGS provides science, consistent monitoring, observation and mapping to support the 
Department’s conservation mission.  USGS research provides insight into changes in the natural 
world – our water, lands, geology, wildlife – and how they may affect our communities.  The 
2020 budget includes $141.0 million for scientific work related to ecosystems, supporting 
investigations related to specific ecosystems, such as Florida’s Everglades; or biological threats 
to species, including White Nose Syndrome in bats.   
 
Water is vitally important to the health and well-being of Americans and our lands and wildlife.  
The USGS works with partners to manage water monitoring networks across the country which 
are relied upon by land managers, industry, and communities concerned about the availability of 
water or risk of flooding.  USGS also addresses water quality issues, such as the prevalence of 
harmful algal blooms, which pose risks to natural resources reliant on water but also people.  The 
2020 budget includes $179.9 million for USGS Water Resources programs to monitor, 
understand, and inform water challenges for the benefit of land and wildlife conservation, and 
communities across the country. 
 
ACTIVE MANAGEMENT FOR HEALTHY FORESTS 
 
Dense undergrowth has amassed on Federal lands, providing fuel for catastrophic wildfires and 
worsening insect infestation, and spread of invasive species and disease.  These conditions are 
harming the Nation’s forests, rangelands, and watersheds, and placing people, their homes, and 
5 
their communities at risk.  These conditions also make it more dangerous for wildland 
firefighters to fight the fires.  Active fuels management is a necessary and important tool to 
combat these threats, save lives, and protect property. 
 
In tandem with the budget, the Administration proposes a package of forest management 
legislative reforms to help address this serious risk.  By providing the Department with 
additional tools to expedite timber salvage operations in response to wildfires, insect and disease 
infestations, and other disturbances, the Department can more effectively reduce the risk of 
wildfire, utilize forest materials damaged as a result of those events, and better allocate resources 
to support restoration activities.  Interior’s 2020 budget includes $194.0 million in Wildland Fire 
Management to support aggressive fuels reduction work and pre-suppression activities to help 
mitigate the incidence of catastrophic wildfires.  The budget also includes $161.8 million for 
timber management programs in the BLM and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), to prioritize 
planning and preparation activities affecting timber sales volumes and forest health.  In addition, 
the BLM budget includes $92.0 million to support healthy rangelands through weed reduction, 
vegetation treatments, and permitted grazing operations.  The NPS budget includes $4.0 million 
specifically to improve active forest and vegetation management in the national parks.   
 
Complementing this initiative, Interior continues to work closely with partners to improve the 
sage-steppe working landscapes of the West which are vitally impacted by wildland fires.  The 
2020 budget includes $55.5 million to implement sage-grouse management plans and continue 
cooperation with Western States on greater sage-grouse conservation.  This funding will be used 
to remove conifers, create fire breaks, remove fire-prone invasive plants, and protect and restore 
habitat for all sagebrush dependent wildlife.  At the end of 2018, nearly 1.5 million acres had 
been treated.  The 2020 budget also includes $75.7 million to continue management of Wild 
Horses and Burros on America’s rangelands. 
 
More active forest management like expedited timber salvage can reduce the risk to firefighters 
and revegetation crews, speeding the recovery of lands.  The expedited recovery of wood 
products also provides an economic benefit.  In turn, the fire risk to people, communities, 
recreation facilities, and infrastructure is reduced.   
 
SAFE AND SECURE COMMUNITIES 
 
The Department of the Interior is the proud home of 3,600 federal law enforcement officers with 
duties as varied as the bureaus’ missions.  Interior has highly specialized units in three major 
cities, drug enforcement teams in Indian Country, urban search-and-rescue units that provide 
hurricane response, and backcountry units that operate in the wilderness for days at a time.  The 
2020 budget includes a total of $930.3 million for law enforcement programs, continues 
successful border enforcement and drug enforcement programs, and supports a new initiative to 
address the epidemic of violence and missing persons in Indian Country. 
 
Interior’s law enforcement officers help to secure Interior lands on the southern border.  Over 
12.5 million acres under Interior jurisdiction are within 50 miles of the United States-Mexico 
border.  More than 655 miles of land along the border are managed by Interior’s bureaus.  
Interior works closely with the Department of Homeland Security to increase security on the 
6 
southwest border, including 75 border miles on Tribal lands, primarily managed by the Tohono 
O’odham Nation in Arizona.  Currently, about 300 miles, or less than half, of Interior’s border 
lands have a vehicle barrier, pedestrian fence, or wall.   
 
Fulfilling the President’s commitment to end the opioid crisis in America is another top priority 
of the Department.  This budget includes $10.0 million including an increase of $2.5 million, to 
continue support for the fight against opioids in Indian Country.  BIA drug enforcement agents 
are part of the Federal Opioid Reduction Task Force addressing the increase in drug-related 
activities through interdiction programs to reduce drug use, distribution, and drug-related crime 
to help communities in Indian Country battle the opioid crisis.  In the first year of operation, the 
Task Force conducted 8 undercover operations leading to more than 180 arrests and seizure of 
more than 1,000 pounds of narcotics worth more than $9.0 million that were intended for sale in 
Indian Country. 
 
Interior’s wildland fire suppression operations are part of a vitally important partnership across 
all levels of government to fight wildfires on public lands and minimize risk to nearby 
communities.  In fiscal year 2018, Interior spent more than $528 million on wildfire suppression 
efforts alone.  The 2020 budget includes $383.7 million for wildfire suppression, pursuant to the 
requirements under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018.  Consistent with the Act, 2020 is 
the first year resources are also available through a wildfire budget cap adjustment to meet U.S. 
Forest Service and Department of the Interior fire suppression needs.  The 2020 budget assumes 
a preliminary split of $300 million of the authorized cap adjustment resources for Interior 
requirements, with the remainder allocated to the U.S. Forest Service.  The Administration will 
reallocate resources between agencies as necessary to meet actual wildfire suppression needs. 
 
Employees from across Interior also serve as part of Federal emergency response efforts.  In the 
event of a natural disaster, our employees work to protect and rebuild Interior’s assets, but are 
also part of the community working to help recovery.  USGS scientists play an important role 
preparing for and addressing the aftermath of natural hazard events.  USGS provides important 
scientific and monitoring information to emergency responders, policy makers, and the public to 
reduce the risk of losses from a wide range of natural hazards, including earthquakes, floods, 
hurricanes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, wildfires, geomagnetic storms, and drought.  
The 2020 budget includes $145.0 million for the USGS Natural Hazards programs.  This funding 
maintains important nationwide monitoring networks that are vitally important to emergency 
managers. 
 
AN ERA OF ENERGY PROSPERITY 
 
By advancing common sense policies that appropriately engage in domestic energy development, 
the Trump Administration is putting America on a path towards continued low fuel costs, high 
paying jobs and greater energy security.  Under the Trump Administration, crude oil and natural 
gas production has hit all-time highs, U.S. net energy imports have fallen to their lowest levels 
since 1982, with the U.S. becoming a net exporter of natural gas in 2017 and expected to become 
a net exporter of energy overall, including petroleum and other liquids, by 2020.   
 
7 
Interior manages a good portion of the natural resources on America’s public lands and waters, 
including oil, gas, coal, hydropower, minerals and renewable energy sources.  The Department 
plays an important role in the Nation’s future energy security and our overall economic well-
being.  Altogether, Interior’s energy and mineral portfolio contributed an economic output of 
over $150 billion and supported an estimated 740,000 jobs nationwide.  The same year, Interior 
shattered prior records in onshore oil and gas and offshore wind energy lease sales, and disbursed 
$8.9 billion in revenues to States, Tribes, local communities, and the U.S. Treasury, an increase 
of $1.8 billion from 2017.   
 
The 2020 budget requests $777.0 million in discretionary resources for energy-related programs 
across the Department.  Together with permit fees and other mandatory funding, Interior’s 2020 
energy programs total $830.1 million.  A large portion of these energy development activities 
occur on the Outer Continental Shelf.  The 2020 request includes a total of $393.9 million to 
support responsible exploration and development of America’s offshore energy resources, which 
remains an important component of the Administration’s energy strategy.  Within this request is 
$193.4 million for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s (BOEM) oil, gas, and renewable 
energy leasing and exploration activities.  The continued efforts of the Bureau of Safety and 
Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) are integral to a strong offshore energy program.  The 
budget includes $200.5 million for BSEE’s work to ensure safe and environmentally sustainable 
energy exploration and production.  BSEE is committed to the continual advancement of the 
effectiveness of its inspection program, enhancing its permitting processes around greater quality 
assurance and consistency, reforming overly burdensome regulations, ensuring high levels of 
preparedness in the event of oil spills, and expanding the renewables program. 
 
The 2020 budget includes $190.4 million in current and permanent funding for BLM’s onshore 
oil and gas activities, of which $137.3 million is requested in direct appropriations.  Funding will 
expand areas available for leasing, expedite permitting, and improve program management.  The 
2020 budget advances activities in Alaska and New Mexico, and continues work to streamline 
leasing processes and speed the review of Applications for Permits to Drill.  Interior has already 
reduced wait times for these permits by 57 days (from 120 days to 63 days).  The budget will 
also help to expedite the processing of rights-of-way permits needed to move energy to 
consumers.   
 
The 2020 BLM budget includes $29.1 million for renewable energy activities.  This funding will 
support the review and siting of geothermal resources, wind and solar energy projects on public 
lands, and rights-of-way applications to connect these projects to transmission lines.   
The 2020 budget includes $19.8 million for the BLM coal management program focused on 
reducing permit processing times, simplifying the lease application process, and improving the 
timeliness to complete lease sale fair market value determinations.  BLM’s Federal coal leasing 
program supplies more than 40 percent of the coal produced in the United States. 
 
The 2020 budget for BIA includes $25.5 million for energy and mineral development programs 
in Tribal communities.  Income from energy and mineral production is the largest source of 
revenue from natural resources on trust lands.  In 2018, more than $1 billion in revenue from oil, 
gas and mineral activities was disbursed to Tribes and individual Indian mineral rights owners. 
8 
Tribes use this revenue to develop infrastructure, provide healthcare and education, and support 
other critical community development programs. 
 
An important component of Interior’s natural resource programs is the collection and 
disbursement of billions of dollars in receipts from development.  The 2020 budget includes 
$147.3 million for the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) to ensure Americans 
receive an accurate return for their public resources.  In 2020, ONRR will continue to implement 
a critical new Minerals Revenue Management Support System to update and improve 
management and accountability of Interior’s significant revenue collections.  
 
FULFILLING OUR TRUST AND INSULAR RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
The Department of the Interior is responsible for fostering the government-to-government 
relationship with Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Villages and overseeing relations with U.S. 
territories and insular areas.  
 
The United States has an important relationship with the affiliated insular areas including the 
territories of American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands.  With China’s escalating influence in the Pacific region, Interior’s 
insular responsibilities and obligations contribute meaningfully to broader Administration policy 
objectives in the region.  In 2020, the Office of Insular Affairs will implement activities to 
bolster healthcare capacity, strengthen island economies, and fulfill U.S. Compact obligations.  
The Office will also participate in foreign policy and defense matters concerning the U.S. 
territories and the freely associated states.  The 2020 budget includes a total of $610.7 million in 
current and permanent authority, with $84.1 million in current appropriations. 
 
Interior provides services directly, or through contracts, grants, or compacts, to 573 federally 
recognized Tribes with a combined service population of nearly 2 million American Indians and 
Alaska Natives.  The Department is committed to Tribal prosperity and working together with 
Tribes to address challenges in economic development, education, and law enforcement.  Interior 
supports Indian self-determination to ensure Tribes have a strong voice in shaping Federal 
policies directly impacting their ability to govern and provide for the safety, education, and 
economic security of their citizens.  Interior’s Tribal programs deliver community services, 
restore Tribal homelands, fulfill commitments related to water and other resource rights, execute 
fiduciary trust responsibilities, support the stewardship of energy and other natural resources, 
create economic opportunity, and provide access to education.  
 
The 2020 budget for Indian Affairs prioritizes programs that serve the broadest service 
population and addresses Federal responsibilities and Tribal needs related to education, social 
services, infrastructure, law enforcement, and stewardship of land, water, and other natural 
resources.  The 2020 budget includes $1.9 billion for BIA, and $936.3 million for BIE.  Within 
this is $367.4 million to fully fund the estimated Contract and Tribal Grant Support Costs Tribes 
incur from managing Federal Indian programs. 
  
The 2020 budget takes action to improve the quality and efficiency of the BIE schools.  In 2020, 
for the first time, we request funding for BIA and BIE separately, as part of an effort to improve 
9 
overall transparency, accountability, and autonomy for the effective delivery of BIE school 
services.  This step is consistent with direction from this Subcommittee which began 5 years ago, 
urging the Department to consolidate all responsibilities related to Indian education under BIE.  
The changes in the 2020 budget respond to your direction and other longstanding criticism that 
the lines of authority for BIE services were not clear, it was too difficult to determine who had 
final accountability for delivering services, and BIE did not have sufficient independence to 
ensure school needs were met.  
 
The 2020 budget is the result of a detailed review within Indian Affairs, looking at the services 
provided to the BIE schools and the different roles of BIA, the Office of the Assistant Secretary 
for Indian Affairs, and BIE.  The review considered where it made sense to decouple overlapping 
functions and where it made sense to continue cross-servicing to BIE with clearer agreements in 
place.  The 2020 request reflects this review and strengthens BIE’s ability to deliver materials 
and services, carry out needed health and safety inspections, and ensure repairs are made.  The 
BIE budget includes $867.4 million to continue core Indian education elementary, secondary and 
post-secondary programs.  It also includes $68.9 million to support facility construction, repairs, 
deferred maintenance, and capital improvements.  
 
The 2020 BIA budget requests $1.5 billion for Operation of Indian Programs.  This includes 
$409.2 million for the Public Safety and Justice programs providing law enforcement, 
corrections, and court services to Indian communities.  The 2020 budget also includes $326.0 
million for Tribal Government programs with $178.9 million for Self Governance Compacts.   
 
The 2020 BIA budget includes $184.1 million for Natural Resources Management supporting 
resource conservation, economic use, recreation, and protection of Tribal resource rights.  Within 
this amount is $54.8 million for Tribal forestry programs which complement of the 
Administration’s forest management legislative reforms.  The budget also includes $11.2 million 
for the Tribal Management/Development Program which supports Tribal management of fish 
and game programs on Indian reservations.  These programs ensure the protection of millions of 
acres of habitat necessary for the conservation of fish, wildlife, and plant resources and 
significantly contribute to the economic development of Tribal communities and the growing 
national demand for outdoor recreation and tourism.  
 
The budget maintains a strong commitment to meet Tribal settlement agreements and includes 
$45.6 million for BIA Water Rights Settlements.  At this funding level, BIA remains on track to 
meet current water settlement commitments within the legislated timeframes.  Across Interior, 
the budget includes $178.6 million for Indian Settlement commitments. 
 
GOVERNMENT REFORM 
 
President Trump challenged Federal agencies to modernize and reform the Executive Branch and 
Interior is leading the way to better serve the American people.  The absolute first step is 
fostering a culture of ethics and respect amongst colleagues.  There is zero tolerance for any type 
of workplace harassment at Interior.  The Department is instilling a culture change through clear 
management accountability, swift personnel actions, reporting procedures for harassment 
conduct, improved training, and substantive action plans.  In the area of anti-harassment efforts, 
10 
each bureau and office has made significant headway to put a diverse set of measures in place to 
prevent and address unacceptable conduct.  
 
We have also launched an internal Workplace Culture Transformation Advisory Council across 
the Department to keep a focus on Interior’s workplace environment.  The Council will look at 
common issues raised in the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, ways to improve employee 
engagement, and building career paths that cross bureau silos; all with the goal to transform 
Interior’s workplace culture for future generations. 
 
Another management priority is creating a strong ethical culture to ensure Interior employees 
honor the public’s trust to manage funds responsibly and avoid conflicts of interest.  The 
expectations for appropriate employee conduct have been made clear, and the Department has set 
goals and expectations for qualified ethics officials sufficient to ensure our operations are 
conducted ethically.  
 
Over many decades, the Department of the Interior experienced new bureaus becoming 
established on an ad hoc basis with their own unique regional organizations.  This ultimately 
resulted in a complicated series of 49 regional boundaries among 8 bureaus.  This complexity led 
to the situation where bureau regional leadership was focused on different geographic areas, did 
not have adequate and shared understanding of the needs and perspectives of regional 
stakeholders, and opportunities to share administrative capacity across bureaus were difficult to 
recognize and implement.  Members of the public were often frustrated by problems in inter-
bureau decision making where uncoordinated timelines and processes could lead to 
unnecessarily long delays in reaching a decision.  In 2018, Interior began a reorganization effort 
focused on making improvements across each of these areas.  
 
Interior’s reorganization is driven by the need to improve our delivery of service to the public. 
The Department developed a reorganization strategy that relies on unified regions across Interior, 
moves some staff west to be closer to the resources and customers they support, improves 
coordination and collaboration among Interior’s bureaus, and reviews standard administrative 
processes across Interior to find smarter ways to conduct business operations. 
 
Last year, Interior took the first step in the reorganization.  After working closely with 
stakeholders across the country on options to consolidate Interior’s 49 different regions into 
common regions, Interior adopted 12 unified regions for a subset of the bureaus.  As a result of 
Tribal consultation, BIA, BIE, and the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians will 
not realign their regional field structure.   
 
Establishing unified regional boundaries across bureaus is the cornerstone of reforms to improve 
Interior’s service delivery to the public. Within each shared region, bureaus will focus work on 
the same resources and constituents and improve coordination across the Department.  For the 
public, fewer regions will make it easier to do business with Interior, particularly when the 
public interacts with several bureaus or jurisdictions.  For Interior’s business, the move will 
strengthen inter-bureau coordination and understanding, joint problem-solving, and mutual 
assistance.  
 
11 
Bureaus and offices have begun to work across organizational lines to identify ways to maximize 
the benefits of the new regions.  In 2019, we are analyzing options to relocate more operations 
out West, where the preponderance of bureau assets and acres are located, to better serve our 
customers.  As part of the planning, we are considering relative cost, accessibility, and the 
specific functions where it makes sense to be closer to field assets.  We are also reexamining 
some of the Department’s common business operations to leverage consistent best practices 
across Interior.  In 2020, the budget requests $27.6 million to continue implementing the 
reorganization with three areas of focus: Implementation of the Unified Regions ($12.1 million), 
Relocation and Regional Stand Up ($10.5 million), and Modernizing Interior’s Business ($5.0 
million). 
 
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS 
 
Forest Health—The Administration proposes a comprehensive package of legislative reforms to 
proactively reduce the risk of wildfires through better management of Federal forests and 
rangelands.  The proposed legislation would provide categorical exclusions on Interior lands for 
active forest management, including the ability to harvest dead, dying, or damaged trees and 
proactive fuels management including the use of fuel breaks.  These changes are much needed to 
help reduce fire risk, improve forest health, minimize after fire impacts, prevent re-burn of fire 
impacted areas, and improve safety for wildland firefighters. 
 
Public Lands Infrastructure Fund—The budget proposes $6.5 billion over 5 years for a Public 
Lands Infrastructure Fund to address deferred maintenance needs in the Departments of Interior 
and Agriculture.  Within Interior, the Fund will support infrastructure improvements through an 
allocation of 70 percent for national parks, 10 percent for national forests, 10 percent for wildlife 
refuges, 5 percent for BIE schools, and 5 percent for lands managed by the BLM.  The Fund will 
be supported by the deposit of 50 percent of all Federal energy development revenue that would 
otherwise be credited or deposited as miscellaneous receipts to the Treasury over the 2020–2024 
period, subject to an annual limit of $1.3 billion.  Interior and Agriculture would prioritize 
projects, monitor implementation, and measure results.  
 
Recreation Fee Program—The budget proposes to reauthorize the Federal Lands Recreation 
Enhancement Act, which expires in September 2020.  As a precaution, the budget also proposes 
appropriations language to provide a 2-year extension of FLREA through September 2022.   
 
Cancel Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act Account Balances—The budget 
proposes to cancel $230.0 million in unobligated balances from the Southern Nevada Public 
Land Management Act (SNPLMA) program over a 3-year period.   
 
EPAct Geothermal Payments to Counties—The budget proposes to restore the disposition of 
Federal geothermal leasing revenues to the historical formula of 50 percent to the States and 50 
percent to the U.S. Treasury by repealing Section 224(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  That 
section changed the distribution to direct 50 percent to States, 25 percent to counties, and 25 
percent to the Federal government.  
 
 
12 
CONCLUSION 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the President’s 2020 Budget Request for the 
Department of the Interior.   
 
In closing, this is a budget that prioritizes core functions important to the American people 
within budget parameters. Complementing this funding request is legislation to provide up to 
$6.5 billion over 5 years to address the deferred maintenance backlog on our public lands. 
 
This budget advances collaborative conservation with investments in the America’s natural and 
cultural resources, support for conservation stewardship partnerships, a focus on species 
recovery and proactive conservation activities to avoid the need for listing, and reforms to 
improve the health of our forest and rangelands and reduce risk from severe wildfires.    
 
I look forward to working with you to support the President’s 2020 budget request.  I am 
prepared to address your questions at this time.

Statement of Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin  
Department of the Treasury 
Before the Appropriations Subcommittee on 
Financial Services & General Government 
United States Senate 
May 15, 2019 
 
Chairman Kennedy, Ranking Member Coons, and members of the Subcommittee, I am pleased 
to be with you today to discuss the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget and our key policy 
priorities at the Treasury Department. 
 
President Trump’s economic program of tax cuts, regulatory relief, and improved trade deals is 
resulting in more jobs and higher wages for hardworking families.  In the first quarter of 2019, 
we saw an annual GDP growth rate of 3.2 percent, far exceeding expectations.  That follows 3 
percent growth from Q4 of 2017 to Q4 of 2018, the fastest fourth quarter to fourth quarter 
growth in 13 years.  Unemployment remains historically low at 3.6 percent, and earnings are up 
year-over-year by 3.2 percent as well. 
 
These results are because America’s economy is the most competitive in the world.  The Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) lowered business taxes and incentivized the investment of hundreds of 
billions of dollars in U.S. business operations, leading to more and better career opportunities for 
workers.  It also cut the Federal income tax liability for a typical family earning $75,000 in half, 
saving them over $2,000 per year because of lower rates, a doubled standard deduction, and 
enhanced child tax credit, among other benefits.  Combined with increased earnings, a typical 
family is seeing as much as $4,000 dollars more in their paychecks annually.  
 
I want to highlight the Opportunity Zones tax incentive, an important component of the TCJA.  
Opportunity Zones will ensure that the economic renewal we are experiencing reaches distressed 
communities.  Opportunity Zones provide capital gains tax relief for investments in areas in need 
of revitalization.  We are seeing great enthusiasm for this policy from entrepreneurs and 
communities seeking to partner with one another to make positive social impacts.  We are 
confident that it will help to restore the promise of prosperity for more Americans. 
 
As you know, trade is a top priority for President Trump and this Administration.  I urge all 
members of Congress to support the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).  This 
deal will create the highest standards ever to protect workers and entrepreneurs in our 
hemisphere.  It will strengthen intellectual property rights, support small businesses and 
manufacturing, and expand U.S. access to Canada’s dairy, poultry and egg markets.  I would also 
note that, for the past several months, Ambassador Lighthizer and I have engaged in intensive 
and serious negotiations with China to improve our trade relationship.  China has recently 
retreated from many commitments they made during those negotiations.  We will keep you 
apprised of any further developments.   
 
 
 
 
Turning to the President’s FY 2020 Budget for the Treasury Department, it reflects our 
objectives of fostering strong economic growth and protecting our national security and 
technology infrastructure.   
 
I would like to highlight our request for funding for the IRS Integrated Business Systems 
Modernization Account.  Our FY 2020 request for $290 million is an installment in our multi-
year plan to update IRS systems and operations.  Carrying out this plan will create a more 
efficient and effective customer-service experience for taxpayers, improve compliance and 
enforcement, and ultimately reduce the long-term costs of maintaining these systems.  Through 
the implementation of new technologies, we will provide innovative resources that will not only 
reduce call and wait times for taxpayers and allow them to conduct business with the IRS online, 
but also continue to protect sensitive taxpayer data.  I would also like to emphasize our program 
integrity cap adjustment that would provide an additional $362 million in FY 2020 for more 
effective enforcement procedures, including investments in data analytics and measures to 
identify and prevent fraud, identity theft, and other instances of non-compliance.  The proposed 
investments will generate about $47.1 billion in additional revenues over 10 years and would 
cost about $14.5 billion, for a net revenue of $32.6 billion. 
 
We are requesting $35 million for the continued implementation of the Foreign Investment Risk 
Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA.  This critical legislation passed with 
overwhelming bipartisan support.  It modernizes the process through which the Committee on 
Foreign Investment in the United States, referred to as CFIUS, reviews transactions for national 
security risks while preserving the United States’ commitment to maintaining an open 
investment environment. 
 
We are also requesting enhanced funding for Treasury’s Office of Terrorism and Financial 
Intelligence and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  These funds are 
necessary to continue protecting our financial system from abuse by rogue regimes, terrorists, 
transnational organized criminal enterprises, and other actors posing threats to the American 
people and our allies.  Our request includes funds for information technology improvements as 
well as mission-support capabilities.  In particular, our request supports the Terrorist Financing 
Targeting Center and implementation of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through 
Sanctions Act, known as CAATSA.  We are also requesting further expansion of FinCEN’s 
capabilities to combat cybercrime and prevent the illicit exploitation of emerging payment 
systems, such as cryptocurrency. 
 
Finally, I would note that the Budget includes additional support for the Office of Critical 
Infrastructure Protection and Compliance Policy to help Treasury identify and reduce emerging 
threats and vulnerabilities to our financial system. 
 
I am pleased to join you today to discuss our plans for creating more jobs, higher wages, and a 
more secure future for the American people.  I look forward to your questions.  Thank you very 
much. "

Statement of Victoria Christiansen, Chief of the USDA Forest Service 
Before the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment 
and Related Agencies 
Concerning President’s Fiscal Year 2020 Proposed Budget 
For the USDA Forest Service 
      May 15, 2019, 9:30 a.m. 
 
Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Udall, and members of the Subcommittee, thank 
you for inviting me here today to testify on the President’s fiscal year 2020 Budget request for the 
Forest Service.  
 
The fiscal year 2020 President’s Budget for the USDA Forest Service totals nearly $5.7 
billion. Of that, $559 million is mandatory funding. It is a good investment for the American people 
and will enable us to make progress in addressing the critical condition of America’s forests. Up to 
80 million acres of the National Forest System, about 4 in every 10 acres, are at moderate to high 
risk from catastrophic fire. Other threats include regional drought, invasive species, and major 
outbreaks of insects and disease. Stakeholders of the USDA Forest Service broadly agree on the 
need for active measures to address the threats across many of the landscapes we manage, and 
Congress has done their part to help. I appreciate the support and innovative authorities that 
Congress provided in the 2014 Farm Bill, the 2018 Omnibus, and the 2018 Farm Bill to help us do 
more to improve the conditions of our forests and grasslands and protect communities. This is an 
indication of Congress’ expectations and trust in us, and I look forward to continuing to work with 
you to meet those expectations. There is much more work to be done to improve landscape 
resiliency for present and future generations, but we are committed to doing the right work in the 
right places at the right scale. 
 
In 2018, Secretary Perdue announced a new strategy entitled, “Toward Shared Stewardship 
Across Landscapes: An Outcome-Based Investment Strategy” that calls for stronger collaborative 
decision-making with States and partners and employs new technology that can be shared. To do 
this, we will continue to reform our processes to better serve those connected to the land, improve 
infrastructure, and collaborate with our partners to set mutual goals and priorities to get more work 
done across landscapes. Use of tools like the Good Neighbor Authority, with more than 200 
agreements in 37 states, 20-year stewardship contracts with cancellation ceiling relief, and other 
internal process improvements, including environmental analysis decision-making, is reducing the 
time and cost needed to produce high quality and science-based decisions that are accomplished 
effectively and efficiently. The agency continues our work on other fiscal reforms, and identifying 
new reforms, to ensure accountability and credibility for every dollar we receive. In this Budget the 
USDA Forest Service proposes a new budget structure that will eliminate cost pools, improve 
transparency and accountability, and will enable efficient delivery of integrated programs at an 
ecosystem/landscape scale level. 
 
Fortunately, implementation of the fiscal component of the fire funding fix begins in fiscal 
year 2020. The USDA Forest Service is requesting access to $1.95 billion of the overall resources 
authorized in the recently enacted “wildfire cap adjustment.” This, in addition to the Suppression 
funding requested in the President’s budget, should dramatically reduce the need for transferring 
funds from our other mission programs to cover firefighting costs. Access to the wildfire cap 
1 
 
adjustment has stabilized our budgeting environment and the President’s Budget is proposing 
funding increases to line items to improve the condition of our forests.  
 
We recognize that the successful delivery of services and work starts with a highly skilled, 
motivated workforce. Forest Service employees remain our largest and most important investment. 
They are essential to confronting the arduous challenges facing America’s forests and grasslands 
and are integral to the services and experiences we provide to citizens and local communities. We 
are aware that we must do more to stop harassment, bullying and retaliation. We have taken, and 
continue to take, significant steps to improve policies, accountability, reporting systems, and 
training around the workplace environment. I want to reaffirm my commitment to continue the hard 
work that will improve our agency’s culture; to continue transparency before this Subcommittee, 
Congress and the public we serve; and to achieve a workplace where all employees are treated with 
respect and dignity, so that they do not fear for their safety—physically or emotionally.  
 
The President’s 2020 Budget  
The fiscal year 2020 request focuses on three primary areas: reducing wildland fire risk, 
improving forest and grassland conditions through shared stewardship, and contributing to rural 
economic prosperity. To address these focus areas, the Budget makes significant investments in the 
following program areas:  
 
  $1.34 billion is proposed for Fire Preparedness, which enables the Forest Service to maintain 
its existing firefighting capability and funds all base 8 salary costs for firefighters.  
  $1.011 billion is proposed for Suppression, the 2015 10-year average, base funding set by 
the 2018 Omnibus which will be frozen through fiscal year 2027. 
o  The Budget seeks $1.95 billion of the authorized wildfire funding fix cap adjustment 
for wildfire suppression activities. 
o  This, in addition to the $1.011 billion for Suppression, would provide about $3 
billion for wildland fire suppression activities in fiscal year 2020.  
  $450 million is proposed for Hazardous Fuels, which supports the agency’s emphasis on 
improving the condition of the Nation’s forests and grasslands while enhancing their 
resilience to the negative effects of wildland fire.  
  $375 million is proposed for Forest Products, which will support the sale of 3.7 billion board 
feet of timber. The Forest Service is working to improve the speed and agility in the 
planning and execution of land management actions, including timber sales.  
  $77 million is proposed for the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program, which 
generates data on past, current, and projected tree inventories for all 50 states. The FIA 
program enables the natural resource community to understand the magnitude of changes in 
forest conditions and trends, and to make projections of future conditions - information 
which is vital to the long-term health of forests and the sustained availability of multiple 
uses from forests. 
 
Legislative Proposals  
The fiscal year 2020 President’s Budget proposes several key legislative changes to improve 
our effectiveness in delivering programs and services:  
 
 
2 
 
  Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act Reauthorization (FLREA): The proposal is to 
reauthorize the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act through September 30, 2022. 
The revenues collected from these recreation fees are an important source of funding to 
enhance the visitor experience through maintenance, operations, and improvements to 
recreation facilities on public lands. This is an interagency proposal with the Department of 
the Interior. The Triennial Report to Congress on Implementation of FLREA, published in 
May 2012, contained several “Considerations for the Future of the Program,” which set the 
foundation for the interagency proposal. 
 
  Grazing Permits: The proposal would amend the Federal Land Policy and Management Act 
(FLPMA) to correct the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act amendment to FLPMA 
Section 402. For this section only, all National Forest System lands would be included so 
that grazing permits on national forests in eastern States and National Grasslands are treated 
equally in National Environmental Policy Act analysis of grazing permits.  
 
  Wild and Scenic Rivers: The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act requires that comprehensive river 
management plans be prepared within three years following a Wild and Scenic River 
designation.  This proposal would change the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to state that the 
Secretary of Agriculture shall not be in violation of Section 3(d)(1) of the Wild and Scenic 
Rivers Act solely because more than three years have passed since a river was designated 
“wild and scenic” and a comprehensive river management plan has not yet been completed. 
If more than three years have passed since designation without the completion of a 
comprehensive river management plan, the proposal would require that a plan must be 
completed or appropriately updated no later than during the next forest plan revision 
process.  
 
  Forest Botanical Products: This proposal would reauthorize the Forest Botanical Products 
Program for charging and retaining fees for the harvest of forest botanical products. The 
objective of the program is to provide for the sale and harvest of forest botanical products in 
a sustainable manner that contributes to meeting the Nation’s demand for these goods and 
services. The proposal would extend the agency’s existing authority for one year, to 
September 30, 2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 extended this authority 
beyond a pilot program through September 30, 2019.  
 
  Communication Site Program -Administrative Fee Retention: This proposal would authorize 
appropriation of a new programmatic administrative fee for communications use 
authorizations to cover the costs of administering the Forest Service’s communications site 
program on National Forest System (NFS) lands.  This new fee, which was authorized by 
the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, subject to appropriation, would allow the agency 
to better manage the growing use of Forest Service lands for communications facilities to 
better serve its customers, emergency services, and visitors to NFS lands by providing 
expanded telecommunications capabilities, including cellular coverage and broadband 
access, to rural communities.  
 
3 
 
  Mineral Receipts; Public Land Infrastructure Fund: This proposal allows the Forest Service 
to be eligible to use up to 10 percent annually from the Administration’s Public Lands 
Infrastructure Fund. This proposed fund was included in the Department of the Interior’s 
FY2020 Budget request to address deferred maintenance needs. The Public Lands 
Infrastructure Fund would be supported by the deposit of 50 percent of all federal energy 
development revenue that would otherwise be credited or deposited as miscellaneous 
receipts to the Treasury over the 2020-2024 period, subject to an annual limit of $1.3 billion.  
 
  Cost recovery Minerals: This proposal would authorize the Forest Service to retain and 
spend new cost recovery fees for locatable mineral plans of operations and surface use plans 
of operations for oil and gas leases, and other written Forest Service authorizations relating 
to the disposal of locatable and leasable (but not saleable) minerals on all NFS lands. The 
agency currently has the authority to collect such fees but does not because we are unable to 
retain the fees. The provision caps the amount that may be retained at $60 million annually. 
This proposal would better align the Forest Service with the Department of the Interior.  
 
  Cost Recovery for Land Uses/Infrastructure Special Use Processing: This proposal would 
change the agency’s cost recovery authority to allow the collection of funds associated with 
the full cost of processing a land use-related special use proposal. The amendment would 
authorize the agency to collect fees at the very beginning of the screening process rather 
than waiting until an application has been fully screened and accepted for consideration. 
Under the current cost recovery law, only when a proposal becomes an application is the 
agency able to recover costs to process the application.  
 
Coupled with the expanded authorities Congress has provided and our internal reforms, 
these legislative proposals will translate to better results, and increased production and work in our 
nation’s forests and grasslands.  
 
In closing, the Forest Service’s fiscal year 2020 Budget request prioritizes investments to 
reduce wildland fire risk, improve forest and grassland conditions through shared stewardship with 
our partners, and contribute to rural economic prosperity. It requires tough choices within our 
existing program of work and will compel us to make delivery of forest and rangeland products and 
services. We will also need to ensure better cost containment and accounting for our spending. The 
Forest Service will continue to meet this challenge. I look forward to working with this 
Subcommittee to fulfill the President’s goals and our key responsibilities for the long-term benefit 
of the Nation’s forests and grasslands and for all Americans. I will be glad to answer your 
questions.

TESTIMONY BY  
J. CHRISTOPHER GIANCARLO 
CHAIRMAN OF THE 
COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION 
BEFORE THE 
SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON 
FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT 
WASHINGTON, DC 
MAY 8, 2019 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Thank you, Chairman Kennedy, Ranking Member Coons, and Members of the 
subcommittee.  I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today, along with my fellow 
colleague from the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), Chairman Jay Clayton. 
 
I want to start by saying thank you to all the members of this subcommittee for 
supporting the work of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and for the  budget 
increase you provided with the enactment of the FY 2019 budget. 1 
 
I would also like to acknowledge the strong working relationship that exists today 
between the SEC and CFTC.  From the outset Chairman Clayton and I recognized the need for 
our agencies to work more closely together.  We are doing that today in the areas of regulatory 
enforcement, cyrptoasset regulation, Dodd-Frank rule harmonization, clearinghouse oversight, 
disaster recovery testing and resolution planning and so much more.  It has been a privilege, a 
pleasure and an honor to work alongside him and the fine men and women of the SEC.  I thank 
Chairman Clayton for being a good partner and trusted colleague in the challenging roles that we 
serve.          
 
As you know, the CFTC oversees the futures, options and swaps markets.  While most 
Americans do not actively participate in these markets, businesses of all sizes use the derivatives 
markets to manage commercial and market risk.  These markets are one reason why American 
consumers enjoy stable prices, not only in the supermarket, but in all manner of consumer 
finance from auto loans to household purchases.   Derivatives markets influence the price and 
availability of heating in American homes, the energy used in factories, the interest rates 
borrowers pay on home mortgages, and the returns workers earn on their retirement savings. 
 
Today, American derivatives markets are the world’s largest, most developed, and most 
influential.  They are relatively unmatched in their depth and breadth, providing deep pools of 
trading liquidity, low transaction costs and friction and participation by a diverse array of global 
counterparties.  They are also some of the world’s fastest growing and technologically 
innovative. 
                                                           
1 Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, PL 116-6 at https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-joint- resolution/31 
 
1 
 
 
American derivatives markets are also the world’s best regulated.  The United States 
is the only major country in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to 
have a regulatory agency specifically dedicated to derivatives market regulation: the CFTC. 
There is a connection between having the world’s most competitive derivatives markets and 
independent Federal regulation.  For over forty years, the CFTC has been recognized for its 
principles-based regulatory framework and econometrically-driven analysis.  The CFTC is 
respected around the world for its depth of expertise and breadth of capability. 
 
The combination of regulatory expertise and competency is one of the reasons why 
derivatives markets continue to serve the global need to hedge price and supply risk safely and 
efficiently.  It is why well-regulated U.S. derivatives markets, by allowing low-cost and effective 
hedging, are of great benefit to American producers and consumers and to the rest of the world. 
 
In short, America’s well-regulated derivatives markets are a national advantage in global 
economic competition.  However, we must not take this advantage for granted.  In order for 
U.S. derivatives markets to remain the world’s best, U.S. markets must remain the world’s best 
regulated.  To be the best regulated, U.S. derivatives markets must have an adequately funded 
regulator.  The CFTC must have adequate resources to continue to serve its mission to foster 
open, transparent, competitive, and financially sound U.S. derivatives  markets that remain the 
envy of the world. 
 
It was five years ago this month that I first testified before the Senate Agriculture 
Committee concerning my nomination to serve on the Commission.  I knew that if confirmed, I 
would bridge the last years of the Obama Administration and the early years of  the new 
Administration.  In 2017, as Chairman of the Commission, I set out my agenda for moving the 
Agency forward.  I pledged to make sure that our derivatives markets  performed their essential 
role moderating price, supply and other commercial risks – shifting risk to those who can best 
bear it from those who cannot.  I said that our markets should be neither the least nor the most 
prescriptively regulated – but the BEST regulated – balancing market oversight, health and 
vitality.  To do that, we would follow a three-part agenda: completing unfinished business of 
the past, improving current operations, and  preparing for the future, what I call becoming a 21st 
Century digital regulator. 
 
I believe the budget request for FY 2020 supports this agenda. 
 
BUDGET REQUEST 
 
The Commission is requesting a total of $315.0 million for FY 2020.  This budget 
request consists of two separate requests, the annual Commission operational funding of 
$284.0 million and a new request to support the relocation of three regional offices of $31.0 
million. The annual operational request of $284.0 million will provide 707 FTE in FY 2020; 
this request is $2.5 million above the FY 2019 President’s Budget Request2  and represents an

inflationary adjustment of less than 1%.  This request seeks an annual increase of $35.0 
million above the FY 2019 Continuing Resolution funding level and is in line with the FY 
2019 President’s Budget. 
 
The budget request of $284 million is the level of funding necessary to fulfill the 
CFTC’s statutory mission. 
 
21st CENTURY REGULATOR 
 
I have frequently talked about transforming the CFTC into a 21st Century regulator 
amidst today’s increasingly digital and algorithmic markets.  I recently identified several factors 
that are challenging the work of regulators: the extraordinary pace of exponential  technological 
change, the disintermediation of traditional actors and business models, and the need for 
technological literacy and big data capability. 
 
I said that the CFTC’s response to rapidly changing markets and technological 
developments, including blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, is built upon the 
following four cornerstones: 
 
•  Adopting an ""exponential growth mindset"" that anticipates the rapid pace of 
technological innovation and the need for appropriate regulatory response; 
•  Becoming a ""quantitative regulator"" able to conduct independent market data 
analysis across different data sources, including decentralized blockchains and 
networks, without being reliant on self-regulatory organizations and market 
intermediaries; 
•  Embracing ""market-based solutions"" to determine the value of technological 
innovations, as we witnessed with the launch of crypto-asset-based futures 
products; and 
•  Establishing an internal FinTech Stakeholder to address the opportunities and 
challenges that FinTech presents and manage the ever-present tension between 
innovation and regulation. 
 
For us, that stakeholder is LabCFTC, which was launched almost two years ago.  In that 
time, it has had over 250 separate interactions with innovators big and small.  It has offices in 
New York City.  It conducts “lab hours” in places where innovators work: from Silicon Valley, 
California to Silicon Hills, Texas and from the South Bank of London to Singapore Center. 
LabCFTC is not a “sandbox.” It does not try to pick winners from losers, nor does it exempt 
firms from CFTC rules. 
 
Instead, LabCFTC provides us both an internal and external technological focus.  
Internally, it means explaining technology innovation to agency staff and other regulators and 
advocating for technology adoption.  Externally, that means reaching out and learning about 
technological change and market evolution, while providing a dedicated liaison to innovators.  It 
has entered into FinTech cooperation agreements with regulators in London, Singapore and 
Australia.  It has published well-regarded technology primers   and requests for comments.  I am 
proud to say that LabCFTC has become a category leader.  Every U.S. federal financial regulator 
3 
 
has either created or is creating a program similar to LabCFTC. 
 
ECONOMIC MODELING AND ECONOMETRIC CAPABILITIES 
 
The FY 2020 budget request will continue to allow the agency to expand its core 
economic expertise in order to conduct in-depth analytical and empirical studies of issues 
affecting all areas of Commission and regulatory interest.  It will allow the Commission to 
address the large volumes of data collected as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The resulting 
work will further enhance the Commission’s understanding of  market risk or systemic risk and 
derivatives market structure and participants, including end users, intermediaries, and traders, 
and connections between futures, cleared swaps, and uncleared swaps. 
 
Improved economic and econometric analysis will improve the analytical and empirical 
foundations of the Commission’s policies and rules and better inform its cost-benefit 
considerations.  Furthermore, this request will enable the Commission to provide more of its 
analysis to the public in the form of white papers on topics of current interest, as well as 
recurring reports on aggregate market trends, trading activity, and positions, and high-quality 
research papers on fundamental properties of relevant markets and sectors of market participants. 
 
CYBER SECURITY 
 
As market leaders and regulators, we must continue to take every step possible to thwart 
cyber-attacks that have become a continuous threat to U.S. financial markets.  With the FY 2020 
budget request, the Commission plans to strength cybersecurity and network defenses, support 
the LabCFTC 2.0 initiative, and invest in the agency’s multi-year cloud strategy. 
 
The Commission seeks new IT security resources to continue progress towards achieving 
compliance with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and related Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) security mandates and ensuring the protection of sensitive 
market participant data. 
 
The same vulnerabilities hold true in the case of futures commission merchants where 
customer accounts hold records and information that requires protection.  We as an agency will 
work hard to ensure that regulated entities live up to their responsibility to ensure their IT 
systems are adequately protected from attacks and customers are protected. 
 
AGENCY REFORM AND THE KISS PROJECT 
 
Two years ago, I announced the launch of Project KISS.  It stands for “Keep It Simple 
Stupid.” It is an agency-wide review of CFTC rules, regulations and practices to make them 
simpler, less burdensome and less costly.  It has resulted in a range of rule and process 
improvements that are reducing regulatory costs and burdens.3  Many KISS initiatives were 
recommended by market participants, but many were also initiated by our own agency staff that 
                                                           
3 Michael Gill, Chief of Staff, U.S. Comm. Fut. Trading Comm’n, Remarks at the National Press Club, CFTC KISS 
Policy Forum, Washington, D.C. (Feb. 12, 2018), available at 
https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opagill2. 
4 
 
saw ways to reduce undue obligations on registrants and market participants.  There are still more 
Project KISS initiatives in the pipeline.  It is my belief that this effort should continue upon my 
departure and be a regular part of the agency’s mission. 
 
DODD FRANK RULEMAKING 
 
The Commission has made progress on completion of its critical Dodd-Frank Act rule 
making.  On November 5, 2018 a five-Member Commission voted unanimously on the 
threshold for swap dealer de minimis to provide the market with certainty that the threshold 
will not fall from $8 billion to $3 billion. 4 
 
In addition, all five Commissioners have committed to Congress to move forward with 
a final position limits rule.  I believe the final rule must be responsive to the public comments 
and ensure that regulatory barriers do not stand in the way of long standing hedging practices 
of American farmers, ranchers, producers and manufacturers, who depend on our markets.  I 
intend to put forth such a position limits rule proposal before I leave the Commission. 
 
SEF REFORMS 
 
The CFTC’s implementation of its swaps trading rules has long been a concern of 
mine.  I believe the current framework is inconsistent with the Dodd-Frank Act by being too 
prescriptive, too burdensome and too modeled on futures markets.  The framework is also 
highly subjective and overly reliant on a series of no-action letters, staff interpretations and 
temporary regulatory forbearance that may change at any time. 
 
That is why, last November, the Commission issued a proposed rule to amend the SEF 
regulations and the trade execution requirement and a request for comment on the practice of 
“post-trade name give-up.”5   I believe there are two crucial reasons to improve the SEF rules: 
risk and opportunity.  The impermanence of the current SEF rule framework poses risk for 
market participants.  At any time staff may well change or withdraw the numerous 
interpretations, guidance and compliance expectations that underpin the current framework.  
Moreover, the current restrictions on methods of execution may turn out to be, by themselves, a 
source of trading risk during a liquidity crisis – when swaps counterparties need to be found 
through less prescriptive and more flexible means of execution. 
 
On the other hand, improving the SEF rules presents opportunity – opportunity for 
service innovation by existing and new market entrants that has waned under the current 
framework.  It is the opportunity to boldly create a regulatory framework that actually fosters 
innovation, entrepreneurship, competition and increased market vibrancy rather than stifle it.  
Improving the SEF rules also increases the chance that the SEC will draw on the new 
framework in whole or in part for their security-based SEF regime.  It would create a common 
U.S. regulatory approach for all swaps products, reducing operational and compliance costs and

5 
 
risks. 
 
I do not support merely tinkering with the current SEF rules to fix their most glaring 
shortcomings or perpetuating the many no action letters and staff guidance on which they rely.  
Such a step would be unworthy of the regulator of the world’s most vital derivatives markets.  
Instead, the agency must not be afraid to build a better and more durable regulatory framework 
for swaps execution that encourages the return of innovation and new service offerings and 
supports vibrant markets and broad-based prosperity for a generation or more.  
 
INCREASED EXAMINATIONS OF CLEARINGHOUSES 
 
Fully funding the CFTC at the FY 2020 levels will support the agency’s oversight of 
clearinghouses.  The agency’s work to conduct regular examinations, in concert with the 
Commission’s surveillance and other functions, is a highly effective method to maintain market 
integrity so that American businesses can rely on these markets.  The Commission leverages 
resources by conducting joint examinations across Commission divisions, and through 
coordinated examinations with the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, where possible.  This effort allows the Commission to be more efficient with its 
limited resources and at the same time, reduce burdens for dual registrants. 
 
In addition, examinations of DCOs help the Commission identify issues that may affect a 
clearinghouse’s ability to control and monitor its risks.  These are among the most important 
examinations that the Commission conducts, as clearinghouses have become critical single 
points of risk in the global financial system.  Furthermore, the number of clearinghouses, the 
scope and complexity of the examination issues and the importance of these examinations to 
overall financial stability are all increasing. 
 
In addition to U.S. clearinghouses, the Commission regulates six registered non-U.S. 
clearinghouses, and has limited oversight of four non-U.S. clearinghouses exempt from 
registration.  The Commission anticipates new applications for DCO registration resulting from 
the explosion of interest in crypto currencies; an area in which protection of the crypto currencies 
will be one of the highest risks.   
 
The Commission has an active, data-driven daily risk surveillance function, and expects 
to continue investing additional resources on human capital, data, and technology to improve our 
current analytical capabilities to keep up with growth in both the scale and complexity of risk 
transmission in the derivatives markets. 
 
Given the emphasis of G-20 and Dodd Frank reform efforts on central clearing as a 
critical tool to help mitigate systemic risk in the global financial markets, the Commission 
expects to grow our stress testing program to help ensure that the clearing eco-system continues 
to be resilient to absorb both market and systemic shocks. 
 
EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT 
 
Recently, the CFTC along with the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA), with support from Her Majesty’s Treasury, issued a joint statement 
6 
 
providing assurances to market participants on the continuity of derivatives trading and 
clearing activities between the UK and U.S. regardless of the outcome of the UK’s withdrawal 
from the EU.6   Together, the four authorities are taking measures to avoid regulatory 
uncertainty about the continuation of derivatives market activity between the UK and U.S.  
These measures should give confidence to market participants about their ability to trade and 
manage risk across the Atlantic.  It is a great credit to the decades-long cooperation between 
the CFTC and the Bank of England, FCA, and HM Treasury, that we are able to work together 
to take these steps. 
 
It is critical that the CFTC continues to work positively with its overseas regulatory 
counterparts, not just in the UK, but in all financial centers.  I am a firm believer that by 
working together with my regulatory counterparts across the globe, in a cooperative spirit, we 
can strengthen our economies while keeping our financial system resilient and stable.  That is 
why the afternoon after the CFTC-UK announcement; I traveled to Brussels to meet with 
European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis and Director-General Olivier 
Guersent to discuss how to broaden cooperation between the CFTC and the EC. 
 
In addition, I am proud to report that we achieved a significant milestone on March 13, 
2019 as the CFTC and the Monetary Authority of Singapore announced the mutual recognition 
of swaps trading venues in our respective jurisdictions.7  In this regard, the CFTC exempted 
certain Singapore trading venues from the SEF registration requirements.  This exemption 
reduces the burdens associated with duplicative and overlapping regulations, mitigates market 
fragmentation, enables U.S. market participants to access Singaporean markets to manage risks 
effectively, and enhances cross-border business opportunities for both U.S. and Singaporean 
firms. 
 
Recently, EU co-legislators reached a political agreement on the new amendments to 
the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR 2.2) pertaining to the regulation and 
supervision of central counterparties (CCPs).  To mark this occasion, I issued two statements: a 
joint statement with Valdis Dombrovskis (Dombrovskis), the Vice-President of the European 
Commission (EC), and a separate statement as Chair of the CFTC.  The statements publically 
affirm that the CFTC’s concerns regarding the potential adverse impact EMIR 2.2 on U.S. 
CCPs and the broader U.S. financial markets remain a significant issue for the U.S. and it is 
our expectation, that EU authorities will address our concerns during the EMIR 2.2 legislative 
process. 
 
The joint statement with Dombrovskis asserts that the CFTC will continue to engage 
with EU authorities on EMIR 2.2 through the next phase of the legislative process, the drafting 
of the implementation regulations (the Level 2 process), and that the EC will consider the 
CFTC’s concerns during this Level 2 process.  It also states that it is the expectation of the EC 
and the CFTC that the implementation of EMIR 2.2, along with the CFTC’s on-going review

of its cross-border regime, will result in a future transatlantic relationship between the EU and 
the CFTC, which will be based on greater deference than there is now. 
 
In my separate statement, I reaffirm my understanding that although the application of 
EMIR 2.2 to U.S. CCPs is not likely to occur until 2020 or beyond, EU authorities, including 
the EC and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), will work with the CFTC 
to address U.S. concerns during the legislative process.  Further, I state that the starting point 
for any future recognition assessment of U.S. CCPs must be the current 2016 Equivalence 
Decision. 
 
These statements taken together are meant to provide market participants who transact 
in both U.S. and EU markets assures that the CFTC and the EC will continue to work through 
our differences to mitigate the impact of unnecessary regulatory and supervisory burdens, and 
to foster economic growth and stability for our global CCPs. 
 
Six months ago, I released a White Paper on cross-border swaps regulation that 
proposed updating the agency’s current cross-border application of its swaps regime with a 
rule-based framework based on regulatory deference to third-country regulatory jurisdictions 
that have adopted the G-20 swaps reforms.8  As our regulatory counterparts continue to 
implement swaps reforms in their markets, it is critical that we make sure our rules do not 
conflict and fragment the global marketplace.  That is why I believe the CFTC should move to a 
flexible, outcomes-based approach for cross-border equivalence and substituted compliance and 
operate on the basis of comity, not uniformity, with overseas regulators. 
 
Before I leave the Commission, I intend to put forward a rule proposal to address the 
registration of non-U.S. CCPs clearing swaps for U.S. persons.  I also intend to put forth a rule 
proposal addressing the registration and regulation of non-U.S. swap dealers and major swap 
participants.  In particular, the proposal will address the risk that non-U.S. swap dealing activity 
poses to the United States, but do so in a way that does not apply the swap dealer rules 
extraterritorially without sufficient consideration of whether the activity truly poses a “direct 
and significant” risk to the U.S. financial system, as Congress intended. 
 
ENFORCEMENT 
 
The fiscal year 2020 budget request will allow the Commission to continue its strong 
record on enforcement and oversight of the derivatives markets to ensure they operate free of 
fraud, manipulation, and other trading abuses.  
 
Two years ago, I issued a warning to those who may seek to cheat or manipulate our 
markets that they would face aggressive and assertive enforcement action by the CFTC.  I 
pledged there would be no pause, let up or reduction in our enforcement of the law and 
punishment of wrongdoing.   
 
During my watch, the CFTC has been resolute in holding market participants to the

https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7817-18.

highest standards of behavior.  In fact, by any measure, enforcement has been among the most 
vigorous in the history of the CFTC, including more enforcement actions, more penalties, 
more large-scale matters, more accountability, more partnering with criminal law enforcement 
and more whistleblower awards than in prior years.9 
    
 The Commission has strengthened its rules and procedures to better protect 
whistleblowers, brought new impactful enforcement cases, and successfully resolved other 
important enforcement cases.  In addition, enforcement resources have been enhanced through 
the internal realignment of the Market Surveillance Branch in 2017 to report directly to the 
Director of Enforcement.  This is one of several actions the Commission has taken to better 
utilize resources across the Commission.   
 
  At the same time, I have strived to make sure CFTC enforcement staff is committed to 
providing incentives for companies and individuals to engage in ethical corporate behavior – to 
develop a true culture of compliance, to do the right thing.  The cooperation and self-reporting 
policies issued by the Division make clear that companies and individuals could receive a 
recommendation for a Commission reduction in penalty if they fully cooperate with enforcement 
investigations, timely remediate, and, most importantly, self-report misconduct before the 
Commission learns about it.  
 
To better encourage compliance, the Division recently issued an advisory on 
cooperation and self-reporting concerning foreign corrupt practices.  As noted in remarks 
accompanying the advisory, James McDonald, the Commission’s enforcement director, 
made clear that if a company or individual not registered (or required to be registered) with 
the CFTC timely self-reports a violation of the CEA involving foreign corrupt practices, 
fully cooperates, and appropriately remediates, the Division will apply a presumption, absent 
aggravating circumstances, that it will not recommend a civil monetary penalty.10 
 
Before I entered government service, I spent a decade and a half working on Wall 
Street.  My commitment to transparent examination practices and robust regulatory 
enforcement derives from that experience.  It is the duty of government generally and the 
particular mission of the CFTC to fairly enforce market regulation and prosecute bad actors.  
We fulfill that mission so that America’s financial markets are places for good people to 
fulfill their dreams, grow the economy and increase prosperity. 
 
AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY FUTURES 
 
Under my leadership at the Commission, we have refocused our attention on 
agricultural commodity futures, the agency’s traditional foundation.

During almost five years on the Commission, I have travelled the country and visited 
agriculture producers in over two dozen states from Montana, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana 
and Iowa to Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Georgia, Mississippi and Oklahoma.  I have 
walked in wheat fields and harvested soybeans, tramped through rice farms and beneath 
pecan groves, milked dairy cows and toured feedlots, visited grain elevators and viewed 
cotton gins.  I have also met with our energy producers, going 900 feet underground in a 
Kentucky coal mine and 90 feet in the air on a North Dakota oil rig.  Throughout, I have 
been moved by the diverse beauty of this country.  I have come to love its hard-working 
families producing food and energy from this abundant land.  These visits have been a great 
privilege for me. 
 
This year in Kansas, we held the CFTC’s second annual agricultural futures conference 
along with Kansas State University.11  Panelists discussed current macro-economic trends and 
issues affecting our markets, such as market speculation, algorithmic trading, trade data 
transparency, novel hedging practices and market manipulation.  Our common purpose was to 
hear from end users who use our markets to hedge risk and consider and address issues of 
emerging market structure and trading practices.   
 
We also hosted a CFTC Agricultural Advisory Committee meeting in Kansas where 
panelists discussed the future of Futures Commission Merchants (FCM) and cash market 
innovations, as well as the evolution of electronic trading in agricultural markets, both very 
timely and important topics.  I believe this was the first ever CFTC advisory committee 
meeting held outside of Washington with all five Commissioners in attendance. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Looking to the past, I will be pleased that I have furthered and confirmed much of the 
Dodd-Frank mandate for swaps.  Where I have identified flaws in implementation, I have 
proposed comprehensive solutions.  In my view, now is the time to create better frameworks 
that are more flexible, more durable and more supportive of deep and liquid markets, in good 
times and in bad. 
 
As for the present, I have tried to do what my parents taught me – to leave any place I 
visit in a better condition than I found it: better run, better funded, more transparent, more 
accountable and more efficient in its vital mission overseeing American markets. 
 
As for the future, I will be satisfied that I have raised the profile and reputation of the 
CFTC and set it on a course for the digital Twenty-First Century.  So much is changing, and 
changing rapidly in our commodity derivatives markets. As market regulators, we are ready to 
listen, and we are working to understand.  And, we will be dogged.  The greater the pace of 
change, the greater must be our capacity to keep pace, understand and harness it.

The CFTC is well along the course of that new direction set two years ago – a course 
that is sustainable and true. 
 
Thank you for a privilege to speak to you today.  It has been my honor to serve you, 
our dynamic markets and the American people.

SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE – DEFENSE 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STATEMENT BY 
 
THE HONORABLE PATRICK M. SHANAHAN 
 
ACTING SECRETARY OF DEFENSE 
 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BUDGET HEARING 
 
MAY 8, 2019 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EMBARGOED UNTIL RELEASE BY THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE - DEFENSE 
   
INTRODUCTION 
 
Chairman Shelby, Vice Chairman Durbin, distinguished members of the Committee, I 
appreciate the opportunity to testify in support of the President’s budget request for Fiscal Year 
(FY) 2020. I am joined today by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph 
Dunford, and the Department’s Comptroller and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. David Norquist. 
 
The size, scale, and importance of collaboration between Congress and the Department of 
Defense (DoD) shows we are united in our purpose to protect and defend our Nation. During 
my time as Deputy Secretary of Defense and now as Acting Secretary of Defense, I have 
engaged in substantive discussions with many members of this Committee. I look forward to 
continuing our engagements, in this hearing and beyond, with both long-serving and new 
members, as the Department drives results along our strategic priorities. 
 
We in DoD appreciate Congress’s partnership in repeatedly demonstrating the bipartisan nature 
of defense. I thank Congress for voting to lift budgetary caps and providing sustained funding 
increases over the last two years, which have helped our military meet today’s challenges while 
preparing for those of tomorrow. Members of this Committee, the entire Congress, and the 
American people can rest assured that DoD has efficiently and effectively invested your money. 
Thank you, in particular, for your support of the FY2019 2.6 percent pay increase for our 
military personnel.  
 
Our responsibility is to remain responsible stewards of your trust and the American people’s 
hard-earned tax dollars. DoD has accelerated necessary changes in how we develop, posture, 
and employ our Joint Force. We are taking a clear-eyed approach to the strategic environment 
in which we operate and marrying our past experiences to new ideas, driving progress and 
fostering innovation in the process.  
 
Our FY2020 budget reflects the President’s vision for prioritizing the security, prosperity, and 
interests of the American people. It also reflects my vision for the future – one marked by a 
more lethal, results-oriented Department of Defense with the capabilities and capacity to ensure 
national security and implement our National Defense Strategy (NDS) at the speed of relevance. 
Today I look forward to discussing that vision and how it is reflected in DoD’s posture and 
resourcing decisions.   
 
 
THE 2018 NDS: AN ENDURING FRAMEWORK 
 
To provide context for that discussion, I want to take us back in time: two years ago, our 
Department had brand new civilian leadership ready to drive results. With a military enduring 
the longest continuous duration of combat in American history, we contended with a host of 
challenges, including an increase in North Korean missile testing; an aggressive Iran; violent 
extremists in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan; and growing strategic competition with China and 
1 
   
Russia. In addition, cyber and space emerged as contested, warfighting domains, further 
complicating an already complex security environment. 
 
Amidst these challenges, the release of our 2018 NDS last January provided the strategic unity 
DoD needed, with clear direction on restoring military readiness and modernizing the Joint 
Force to address great power competition. 
 
The 2018 NDS’s unified framework enables a potent combination of teamwork, resources, and 
an unmatched network of allies and partners stepping up to shoulder their share of the burden 
for international security. The NDS also fosters alignment within the Department, the 
Interagency, industry, and Congress. 
 
More than fifteen months after its release, I say with conviction: the NDS remains the most 
effective aligning mechanism for the Department. Its implementation is our most critical 
mission. Yet, strategy cannot be static; it must be constantly reevaluated. In February, my staff 
concluded a clear-eyed assessment of our NDS priorities and our progress in meeting them, 
highlighting our successes and making clear we still have more work to do. Most significantly, 
it reaffirmed that erosion of our competitive edge against China and Russia continues to be 
DoD’s most pressing “central problem.” Our three primary lines of effort – increasing our 
military’s lethality, strengthening our network of alliances and partnerships, and reforming 
DoD’s business practices – remain the most effective avenues for addressing this challenge. 
 
I thank Congress for its own evaluation via the NDS Commission. Having reviewed the 
findings of both our internal DoD assessment and of the Commission’s report, I am confident 
we are aligned on the most critical matters. The few areas where we did not agree reflect the 
reality that finite resources require tough choices. DoD stands by these choices as necessary 
components of our strategic approach.  
 
As our Department has aligned behind our Strategy, our competitors have not been complacent. 
They have accelerated their own military modernization efforts and vigorously pursued the 
development and fielding of advanced technologies with a clear intent: create an asymmetric 
military advantage against us, our allies, and our partners. 
 
 
PRIORITY THREATS & POLICY OBJECTIVES 
 
THE CHINA THREAT 
 
As this Committee recognizes, the Chinese Communist Party exports coercive influence far 
beyond its borders while internally wielding authoritarian governance over its own people. To 
achieve hegemony in the Indo-Pacific in the near term and shape a world consistent with its 
authoritarian model, China is: (1) aggressively modernizing its military, (2) systematically 
stealing science and technology and seeking military advantage through a strategy of Military-
2 
   
Civil fusion; (3) undermining the rules-based international order, which has benefited all 
countries, including China, and (4) building an international network of coercion to further its 
economic and security objectives.  
 
Military Modernization 
 
The trajectory of China’s military spending is clear. In just twenty years, China’s official 
defense budget soared from roughly $20 billion in 1998 to $170 billion in 2018, with actual 
spending even higher. In March, China announced a projected 7.5 percent increase in defense 
spending in 2019. China devotes these funds to aggressive military modernization and advanced 
weaponry development, from nuclear and missile capabilities to space and cyber. Accounting 
for purchasing power and the significant portion of our military budget going to pay and 
benefits, today, China’s defense spending approaches that of the United States.  
 
China has made investments specifically intended to offset U.S. advantages, including robust 
anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) networks, more lethal forces, and new strategic capabilities. If 
deployed to overwhelm U.S. or allied combat power at initial stages of a conflict, these 
capabilities could seek to achieve a “fait accompli” that would make reversing Chinese gains 
more difficult, militarily and politically. Implementation of our Strategy ensures we have the 
capabilities, posture, and employment of forces so this never comes to pass. 
 
On the nuclear front, China is developing long-range bomber capabilities that, if successful, 
would make it one of only three nations in the world to possess a nuclear triad. In addition, 
China is building up its inventory of missiles, focusing on those intended to circumvent U.S. 
and allied defenses and deny the United States critical military access to the Indo-Pacific. 
Within the past five years alone, China has successfully tested hypersonic cruise and boost glide 
weapons concepts for these purposes.  
 
In 2018, China conducted more space launches than any other nation. In choosing to develop 
counterspace and dual-use space capabilities and enhance space-based intelligence, surveillance 
and reconnaissance, China has demonstrated its ability to weaponize space, if desired. We, in 
turn, cannot ignore China’s ability to target U.S. and allied space capabilities. We also cannot 
ignore China’s ambitions in the cyber domain, which it recognizes as the battlefield’s “nerve 
center.” With all People’s Liberation Army (PLA) cyber operations coordinated under one roof, 
China can operate in this contested domain without bureaucratic red tape to slow it down.   
 
Technology Theft 
 
The rate at which China is systematically stealing U.S. and allied technology for its own 
military gain is staggering. Reversing this dangerous trend – one which could impact our troops 
on the battlefield – means acknowledging reality: every Chinese company is at risk of being 
either a witting or unwitting accomplice in China’s state-sponsored theft of other nations’ 
military and civilian technology. To quote China’s own cybersecurity law, private companies 
3 
   
are required to “provide technical support and assistance to public security organs and national 
security organs,” whether they want to or not. Any U.S. or allied company that works with 
Chinese companies, without proper safeguards, thus opens itself to theft as well. 
 
To grasp the pervasiveness of the problem, look to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 
There are open Chinese economic espionage or technology theft cases in nearly all FBI field 
offices. For years, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has indicted members of the Chinese 
state and military for stealing U.S. technology. In January, DoJ recognized China’s escalating 
tactics and took a step further, indicting executives of Chinese telecommunications company 
Huawei for scheming to steal T-Mobile’s trade secrets.  
 
Huawei exemplifies the Chinese Communist Party’s systemic, organized, and state-driven 
approach to achieve global leadership in advanced technology. With initiatives like the Digital 
Silk Road, Made in China 2025, and Thousand Talents Program in play, which spur companies 
and individuals to carry out its bidding, China aims to steal its way to a China-controlled global 
technological infrastructure, including a 5G network. China pursues large-scale acquisition of 
foreign companies in sensitive sectors and pressures companies into transferring technology. 
Finally, China’s Military-Civil Fusion strategy seeks to translate cutting-edge technology into 
advanced weapons. 
 
Here I must note: some U.S. companies have voiced ethical qualms about working with DoD to 
develop advanced technology, in some cases even terminating relationships – often while 
continuing to work with China. DoD takes ethical considerations extremely seriously when 
researching and developing emerging technologies, and our efforts improve performance and 
allow human beings to make better decisions. China, on the other hand, repeatedly demonstrates 
little regard for international ethical rules and norms.  
 
China’s approach to technological advancement matters for our military advantage, and its 
ambitions threaten the security of critical U.S. capabilities and technological infrastructure, and 
thus our military operations, safety, and prosperity. 
 
Let me be perfectly clear: the United States does not oppose competition, as long as it takes 
place on a fair and level playing field. However, we cannot accept the unfair and illegal actions 
of others who intend to tilt the playing field through predatory economics and underhanded 
tactics.  
 
Undermining the Rules-based International Order 
 
We all know China’s population is comparable to the Americas and Western Europe’s 
combined. But China is also geographically situated within arm’s reach of 2.4 billion people, 
roughly a third of the earth’s population, across Southeast Asia, Japan, and India. Make no 
mistake – China is extending that reach by increasing its overt military and coercive activities 
vis-à-vis its neighbors.  
4 
   
 
China’s increasingly provocative behavior in the Indo-Pacific, particularly the South China Sea 
(SCS), should concern us all. Between 2013 and 2018, China increased its air and sea 
incursions into the SCS twelvefold. Within those five years, it also increased deployments of 
offensive and defensive weapons systems to the SCS by the same order of magnitude.  
 
China’s land reclamation and militarization far exceed that of other claimants combined in the 
South China Sea.  Between 2013 and 2015 alone, China created more than 3,200 acres in the 
SCS, building features within its self-proclaimed ‘nine dash line’ – a claim the Permanent Court 
of Arbitration in The Hague ruled in 2016 has no legal basis. These constructed features are 
almost four times the size of Central Park in New York City and roughly five times the size of 
this Capitol Hill neighborhood.  Imagine walking from this hearing room to the Marine 
Barracks at 8th and I over what used to be part of the Pacific Ocean.  
 
Now also picture Chinese interference in freedom of navigation. Yet for this, we do not have to 
use our imaginations. China habitually threatens this freedom, using both conventional military 
force projection and “gray zone” or irregular warfare activities. For example, in September, 
Chinese military vessels came dangerously close to the USS Decatur off the coast of the Spratly 
Islands. China’s force projection inside and outside the SCS disrespects and undermines our 
rules-based international order and threatens regional stability and security. 
 
International Network of Coercion 
 
Lastly, China is diligently building an international network of coercion through predatory 
economics to expand its sphere of influence. Sovereign nations around the globe are 
discovering the hard way that China’s economic “friendship” via One Belt, One Road can come 
at a steep cost when promises of investment go unfulfilled and international standards and 
safeguards are ignored.  
 
Let us look at just a few examples. Saddled with predatory Chinese loans, Sri Lanka granted 
China a ninety-nine-year lease and seventy percent stake in its deep-water port. The Maldives 
owes China roughly $1.5 billion in debt – about thirty percent of its GDP – for construction 
costs. Pakistan will owe China at least $10 billion in debt for the construction of Gwadar Port 
and other projects.  
 
In Africa, Djibouti owes China more than eighty percent of its GDP and, in 2017, became host 
to China’s first overseas military base. In Latin America, Ecuador agreed to sell eighty to ninety 
percent of its exportable crude oil to China through 2024 in exchange for $6.5 billion in 
Chinese loans. And after leasing land tax-free to China for fifty years, Argentina is denied 
access and oversight to a Chinese satellite tracking station on its sovereign territory, unwittingly 
allowing the facility’s use for military purposes.  
 
5 
   
The list of nations entrapped by China’s predatory debt tactics runs long, and some have started 
to push back. Yet, under the guise of good-intentioned development, Beijing continues to 
leverage debt for economic or political concessions – a practice we expect will intensify as 
more nations prove unable to pay China back.  
 
POLICY OBJECTIVES TO MEET THE CHINA THREAT 
 
Left unaddressed, China’s success in unfairly tilting the playing field in its favor has serious 
implications for our own military advantage. While we do not seek to contain China, we expect 
China to play by the rules, meeting the same standards to which the United States and all other 
nations are held. We will cooperate with China wherever and whenever possible, but we also 
stand ready to compete where we must to ensure our military’s competitive advantage for 
decades to come. 
 
As German Minister of Defense Ursula von der Leyen said last month in Munich, “our 
partnerships are not built on domination. They do not create political and economic 
dependencies.”  Our pursuit of many belts and many roads creates alternative options for 
nations unwilling to succumb to China’s increasingly coercive methods. 
 
As such, DoD’s priority policy objectives are to outpace Chinese military modernization to 
deter future conflict, or win decisively should conflict occur; protect U.S. and partner research 
and development of advanced technology from rampant Chinese theft, and; maintain a free and 
open Indo-Pacific built on strong alliances and growing partnerships.  
 
THE RUSSIA THREAT 
 
China is not the only nation attempting to undermine U.S. interests and security to alter the 
international order in its favor. Despite having an economy smaller than that of the state of 
Texas, Russia, against the economic odds, seeks a return to great power status. Though it has 
not reached that goal, Russia is playing a weak strategic hand well by: (1) aggressively 
modernizing its military; (2) projecting military might beyond its borders; (3) intimidating its 
neighbors, including exploiting their energy dependence for strategic gain, and; (4) 
undermining other nations’ sovereign democratic processes. 
 
Military Modernization 
 
Russia is aggressively modernizing its military to gain an asymmetric advantage over the 
United States and NATO. Russia plans to spend $28 billion to upgrade and modernize each leg 
of its strategic nuclear triad by 2020, and has already spent more than ten percent of its total 
military budget every year since 2011 on nuclear modernization efforts. In March 2018, 
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Russia’s development of six new strategic 
weapons systems – five of which are nuclear capable – including hypersonic systems able to 
6 
   
maneuver at ten times the speed of sound and intended to circumvent U.S. missile defense 
capabilities. One of those hypersonic systems is expected to enter service this year. 
 
In addition to modernizing its strategic weapons systems and delivery platforms, including its 
submarine fleet, Russia is building a large, diverse, and modern set of non-strategic systems, 
including the dual-capable SSC-8 cruise missile, which clearly violates the Intermediate-Range 
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. Every NATO Ally agrees on this point and supports our decision 
to withdraw from the INF Treaty in response to Russia’s material breach. A treaty not followed 
by all parties cannot be an example of effective arms control. For any who doubt U.S. efforts to 
bring Russia back into compliance with the Treaty, I would emphasize: we held over thirty 
meetings with the Russians at every level of government for more than five years – across two 
administrations, one Democrat and one Republican. 
 
Moving to space, Russian systems are intended to disrupt, degrade, and damage U.S. satellites 
in orbit. There is no question: Russia treats space as a warfighting domain to gain military 
advantage over the United States. Moscow has already fielded ground-based directed energy 
laser weapons and is developing air-based systems and additional novel counterspace 
capabilities to target our space-based missile defense sensors. Russia now has the third largest 
collection of operational satellites in the world, behind only us and China. 
 
Projecting Military Power 
 
On top of modernizing its military capabilities, Russia also projects its military might around 
the globe. In 2018, Russia conducted its largest strategic military exercise since 1981. Today 
Moscow deploys a variety of aviation and naval missions to the Pacific, the Arctic, the 
Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the western hemisphere. In December, Russia sent 
bombers to Venezuela, conducted several patrols in the Caribbean, and has since deployed 
military forces to Venezuela to support the failed Maduro regime. And in the Middle East, 
Russia has continued support for Syria’s murderous regime with expeditionary operations and 
long-range strikes. These examples make clear Russia’s ambitions for a more globally dominant 
military footprint. 
 
Strategy of Intimidation 
 
In addition to projecting military power far beyond its borders, over the last decade Russia has 
attempted to incrementally push geographic boundaries with its neighbors. From its 2008 
invasion and continued occupation of twenty percent of Georgian territory to its 2014 invasion 
and continued occupation of Crimea, Russia demonstrates blatant disregard for other nations’ 
sovereignty. Lest we forget, Russia still holds twenty-four Ukrainian crewmembers it captured 
last November, when it attacked three Ukrainian ships near the Sea of Azov in violation of 
international law. 
 
7 
   
Russia’s escalating intimidation efforts are amplified by irregular warfare and “gray zone” 
tactics intended to sow confusion, conceal military movement, and limit accountability. By 
deploying mercenaries – like those of the Wagner Group to places like Crimea, Syria, Libya, 
and now Venezuela – instead of uniformed soldiers, Russia hopes its use of proxies will further 
muddy the already murky waters of conflict and limit international response to its actions. 
Russia’s attempts at deception are not fooling anyone.  
 
Undermining Sovereign Processes 
 
Russia’s duplicity also extends to the cyber domain, where it propagates coordinated 
disinformation campaigns to undermine sovereign democratic processes. In April 2018, 
Facebook estimated that roughly one million users followed a page operated by Russia’s 
Internet Research Agency (IRA). Last year, Twitter identified more than 3,800 IRA accounts 
that had generated millions of tweets over a nine-year span. These accounts are intended to 
foster divisiveness in the West and undermine trust in democratic institutions.  
 
Russian efforts extend beyond their bots and internet trolls – they conduct deliberate cyber 
operations against the United States and other sovereign nations. To name a few examples of 
Russian handiwork: it has targeted U.S. government and critical systems to allow damage or 
disruption of U.S. civilian or military infrastructure during a crisis; launched distributed denial 
of service attacks against NATO, Ukraine, and German government websites, and; released a 
potent cyber virus that caused billions of dollars in damage around the world. 
 
In response, we are not complacent. DoD is getting after the problem, and we are achieving 
results, most notably in our recent successful efforts to stymie Russian disruption of our 
midterm elections. We are determining what other actions DoD and our Interagency partners 
must take to ensure the continued safety and integrity of our democratic institutions. 
 
POLICY OBJECTIVES TO MEET THE RUSSIA THREAT 
 
As these examples make clear, Russia is intent on undermining U.S. military advantage to alter 
the existing balance of power in its favor. In order to thwart Russia’s efforts to regain peer 
competitor status, DoD is focused on modernizing our military to enhance deterrence and 
prevent future conflict, while bolstering burden sharing to ensure the NATO Alliance remains 
credible and capable against Russian aggression.  
 
We are also working diligently with the Interagency, our allies, and our partners to deter 
Russia’s physical intimidation and contest its cyber aggression, information warfare, and “gray 
zone” tactics in Syria and beyond. That includes ensuring Russia does not control the 
international narrative, casting its malign intentions and actions under a cloak of subterfuge, 
disinformation, and malign propaganda. We are strengthening our ability to counter this 
deliberate deceit, both on our own and with our allies and partners. 
 
8 
   
REGIONAL THREATS: NORTH KOREA & IRAN 
 
As DoD modernizes to win competition with China and Russia, we also remain alert to regional 
threats, like those posed by the Iranian and North Korean regimes.  
 
While President Trump and our diplomats negotiate for the denuclearization of North Korea, its 
collection of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles continues to pose a threat to the U.S. 
Homeland, as well as our allies. 
 
Iran, for its part, relentlessly seeks to expand its malign influence across the Middle East and 
beyond. By providing advanced conventional weapons and military support to the Syrian 
regime and Houthi rebels in Yemen, and offering support and financing to terrorist groups like 
Lebanese Hizballah, Iran is entrenching and proliferating its clout across the region. In addition, 
Iran demonstrates reckless behavior in the maritime domain. Iranian leaders repeatedly threaten 
to close the Strait of Hormuz – the gateway for almost a third of all global sea-traded oil – to 
international shipping and allow Iranian-backed Houthis to conduct attacks on international 
shipping in the Bab al-Mandab.  
 
Iran has also increased funding for its cyber efforts twelvefold under President Rouhani, as well 
as increased espionage and targeting of U.S. government and commercial entities since 
withdrawing from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. DoD also remains closely attuned to 
the threat posed by Iran’s ballistic missile capabilities and remains vigilant about the potential 
that Tehran may one day decide to pursue a nuclear weapon.   
 
POLICY OBJECTIVES TO MEET REGIONAL THREATS 
 
In support of the ongoing negotiations for the denuclearization of North Korea, DoD aims to 
ensure our diplomats continue to speak from a position of strength. Our alliances in the region 
remain ironclad, including with the Republic of Korea and Japan. Together we deter North 
Korean aggression and maintain our ability to protect the Homeland and win decisively should 
conflict ever occur.  
  
To counter Iran’s destabilizing influence across the Middle East, DoD seeks to deepen and 
expand alliances in the region and strengthen local partners’ capabilities and capacity to manage 
and counteract threats. We also seek to ensure freedom of navigation for all, bolster resilience 
against destructive cyber-attacks, and prevent weapons of mass destruction (WMD) from falling 
into the hands of irresponsible actors. 
 
THE TERRORISM THREAT 
 
Working by, with, and through an expansive network of international partners, we have made 
meaningful progress in thwarting terrorist designs against the U.S. Homeland and interests. Yet 
we do not discount the threats that continue to emanate from violent extremist organizations 
9 
   
(VEOs), as they seek to conduct and inspire attacks, gain legitimacy by exerting control over 
territory, enjoy safe haven in under-governed countries, obtain access to WMD material, and 
proliferate their ideology to others across the globe. 
 
Taking a step back from our hard-won successes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria 
(ISIS), we also recognize the global fight against radical Islamist terrorists is not over. From the 
1980s to now, the number of nations, either unwittingly or willingly, providing safe haven to 
VEOs has increased eleven-fold. Today, radical Islamist terrorist movements are organized in 
more than two dozen countries, and the globe must contend with more than one hundred VEO-
directed, enabled, or inspired attacks every year. VEOs continue to take advantage of instability 
in places like Yemen, Syria, Libya, Iraq, the Maghreb, Lake Chad, Somalia, and Afghanistan, 
preying on the conflict-ridden to grow their influence. 
 
POLICY OBJECTIVES TO MEET THE TERRORISM THREAT 
 
Recognizing terrorism as a global threat, we must pursue global solutions that utilize the unique 
capabilities and capacities of our allies and partners, in addition to our own. Military might 
alone will not eliminate terrorist ideology or the threat of future terrorist attacks.  
 
However, we can and are reducing the likelihood of an attack on our Homeland, our troops, and 
our interests by contributing to a whole-of-government and coalition approach. Together, we 
are removing terrorists’ ability to control and hold territory; bolstering the internal security and 
stable governance of vulnerable states; ensuring the proper safeguarding of WMD material from 
terrorist hands; checking their ability to exploit emerging technologies, including unmanned 
systems; targeting VEO financial networks and countering terrorist ideology online to limit its 
spread to the greatest extent possible; and sharing intelligence to limit the risk of attack around 
the world.  
 
 
WHAT DoD IS DOING ABOUT IT 
 
To meet our policy objectives, DoD cannot simply keep pace with our competitors as they 
increase their regional and global influence, grow their military capabilities, and develop and 
field advanced technologies. We must – and will – significantly outpace them.  
 
We have made tough choices that align finite resources with our strategic priorities, reducing 
some day-to-day operational requirements now so we are prepared to deter, compete, and win 
against strategic competitors in the future. Our work bringing the NDS to life is far from over, 
but we are demonstrating clear progress along our three lines of effort.  
 
 
 
 
10 
   
Increasing Lethality 
 
In order to protect the Homeland and remain the most lethal military in the world, we have 
begun a paradigm shift towards a more balanced, distributed, survivable, and cost-imposing 
Joint Force. In 2018, we closely linked our combatant commands’ operations to policy 
objectives and our Service plans to capability and capacity, with a focus on execution and 
performance. We are adjusting our posture, increasing lethality, improving operational 
readiness, and beginning to modernize and innovate at scale. These efforts allow us to better 
exploit adversary weakness, project power in contested environments, and expand our combat 
credible forward presence. 
 
We have shifted our posture in key regions, taking initial steps to economize for sustainable 
missions in the Middle East and South Asia to prepare for the possible high-end fight of the 
future. In doing so, we maintain strategic predictability and implement operational 
unpredictability via the Dynamic Force Employment (DFE) model. This approach provides 
assurance to our allies and partners, while keeping our competitors and adversaries on their 
toes. We demonstrated DFE in action last year, when one of our carrier strike groups returned 
early from deployment unannounced and quickly redeployed to the North Atlantic – the first 
carrier strike group to conduct operations there since the 1990s. 
 
We encourage and welcome all individuals who can meet our exacting requirements to join our 
military’s ranks. A key element of strengthening our military and increasing lethality is 
ensuring our warfighters achieve established physical, mental, and security vetting standards. 
War is unforgiving, and our mission demands we remain a standards-based organization. In 
upholding systematically applied standards, we ensure the readiness of our Joint Force and 
cohesion of our units. One of those standards is deployability. Since June, we have lowered the 
percentage of non-deployable Service Members by one percent – that means roughly 20,000 
fewer non-deployable Service Members today than ten months ago.  
 
DoD has also worked diligently to ensure our personnel have the capacity, training, and 
capabilities they need to achieve results. Last year, we accelerated delivery of more than 14,000 
munitions and precision guidance kits to our warfighters, turned the corner on replenishing 
critical munitions stockpiles, and made strides to rapidly deploy cutting edge equipment to the 
warfighter. Our Close Combat Lethality Task Force continues to strengthen our infantry’s 
lethality, survivability, resiliency, and readiness for close combat. Four out of five U.S. combat 
deaths occur in our infantry. Therefore, it is a strategic imperative to ensure those who confront 
war’s grimmest realities never enter into a fair fight.  
 
This work on personnel and munitions readiness feeds into complementary efforts to increase 
equipment readiness. In October 2018, we set an eighty percent readiness target for mission 
critical aviation platforms. In just a few months, almost every type, model, and series of aircraft 
targeted by that memorandum has demonstrated progress. This year, we will establish similarly 
ambitious readiness targets across the DoD enterprise. In addition, our Services have made 
11 
   
impactful readiness gains. As one example, the Air Force’s operational squadrons are twenty-
three percent more ready today than in 2017, and we will have twenty-five percent more pilots 
able to carry out missions in FY2019 than in FY2016.  
 
On modernization, we remain committed to a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent. 
Nuclear deterrence has kept the peace over the last seventy years, and its importance has been 
reaffirmed by every Congress and every president since Harry Truman. Last year, DoD released 
our Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which details the need for modern and tailored nuclear 
capabilities and capacity that meet the realities of our times. We are moving out on those 
efforts. With FY2019 funding, we are recapitalizing and modernizing our aging legacy forces, 
including our nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3), while pursuing prudent, 
modest adjustments to our arsenal, which will increase the flexibility of our response options. 
 
Here it is worth re-stating – Russia is aggressively developing and modernizing a suite of 
strategic and non-strategic nuclear weapons. Not only does this add urgency to the 
modernization of our legacy forces, it underscores the importance of the supplemental 
capabilities called for in last year’s NPR.  Both the low-yield submarine-launched ballistic 
missile (SLBM) and the sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM) close what we believe to be 
troubling gaps in regional deterrence. These are not redundant capabilities. The low-yield 
SLBM, deployed in small numbers, will provide a highly tailored response to specific 
developments in Russia’s forces and doctrine that may lead Russia to mistakenly believe it 
could potentially use a small number of low-yield nuclear weapons without risking a U.S. 
military response. A nuclear SLCM will provide a similar capability in response to serious 
developments and trends in Russia’s nonstrategic nuclear forces. These supplemental 
capabilities enhance deterrence and stability. 
 
Turning to emerging technology fields, DoD has identified ten key areas: hypersonics; fully 
networked C3; directed energy; cyber; space; quantum science; artificial intelligence 
(AI)/machine learning; microelectronics; autonomy; and biotechnology.  
 
We have invested in basic research, rapid prototyping, and experimentation to mature 
technology that can be used at scale. We are also updating our warfighting doctrine as the 
character of warfare changes. Take AI for example – competitors are investing heavily in this 
field, redefining the future of warfare. Last year, DoD established the Joint AI Center (JAIC), 
and we released our AI Strategy in February of this year. These efforts accelerate DoD’s 
delivery and adoption of AI at the speed of relevance, while attracting and cultivating the best 
global talent. 
 
In pursuit of stronger missile defense, DoD released our Missile Defense Review (MDR) in 
January, which recognizes the accelerating proliferation of advanced offensive missile 
capabilities around the world.  The MDR articulates a comprehensive approach that combines 
deterrence, active and passive missile defense, and attack operations. We continue to maintain 
12 
   
ground- and sea-based missile defenses while also developing new capabilities to counter new 
threats.  
 
As the MDR illustrates, our military is not constrained by earth’s geography. We are taking 
steps to secure unfettered access to and freedom to operate in space, in accordance with our 
international agreements and obligations. Reforming the organization of the military space 
enterprise is fundamental for protecting our roughly $20 trillion economy and our position as 
the world’s strongest military. In March, we submitted a legislative proposal to Congress 
requesting authorization and associated appropriations for a U.S. Space Force. If approved, the 
Force would transform our approach to space, increasing our responsiveness in this warfighting 
domain. Establishing a sixth branch with dedicated military leadership will unify, focus, and 
accelerate the development of space doctrine, capabilities, and expertise to outpace future 
threats, institutionalize advocacy of space priorities, and further build space warfighting culture. 
I ask for your support of our proposal, so we can move out in this critical domain. 
 
We recognize restoring military readiness, modernizing our Joint Force, and increasing lethality 
will not happen overnight, but as the above examples demonstrate, we are making meaningful 
progress. 
 
Strengthening Alliances and Partnerships 
 
Beyond DoD’s efforts to improve readiness and lethality, we are expanding collaboration and 
cooperation outside the Department. DoD’s participation in combined military exercises has 
increased by seventeen percent in the last two years, and our Foreign Military Sales have 
increased by more than sixty-five percent in the last three years. Across the globe, DoD has 
leveraged opportunities to expand and deepen our already unmatched network of allies and 
partners, while making real progress on burden sharing for international security.  
 
Starting in the Indo-Pacific, our priority theater, we continue to pursue many belts and many 
roads by keeping our decades-old alliances strong and fostering growing partnerships. In all our 
actions, we demonstrate our commitment to a free and open region, marked by respect for the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations, big and small. 
 
We are fortifying our bedrock alliances with Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the 
Philippines, and Thailand while growing key partnerships across the Indo-Pacific. It is worth 
noting here that four out of the five nations in our Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network are 
also Pacific nations, further emphasizing the region’s importance.  
 
In 2018, the United States took historic strides with two key partners in particular, Vietnam and 
India. Our Navy conducted the first U.S. aircraft carrier visit to Vietnam since the Vietnam 
War, and we participated in the inaugural U.S.-India 2+2 Strategic Dialogue in New Delhi, 
showing growing trust between the world’s oldest and largest democracies. 
 
13 
   
While our diplomats chart a path to the denuclearization of North Korea, DoD continues to 
enforce United Nations Security Council resolution sanctions against North Korean ship-to-ship 
transfers, alongside allies and partners. We have also improved integration of our missile 
defense assets on the Korean Peninsula to better protect U.S. Forces and allies. 
 
In July 2018, we conducted the largest naval exercise in the world, the Rim of the Pacific or 
RIMPAC, alongside twenty-five other nations. That and our Southeast Asia Maritime Security 
Initiative have boosted interoperability and increased our allies and partners’ ability to conduct 
maritime security and awareness operations on their own. Our efforts across the region have 
enabled our allies and partners to take a tougher stand against Chinese aggression in 
international waters. For example, this past year France, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, 
Australia, and New Zealand all increased their presence in the East and South China Seas, 
reiterating our collective stance to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows. 
 
In Europe, the United States is fortifying relationships, realizing burden sharing gains, and 
developing a more lethal, combined capability. This year, NATO – the most successful Alliance 
in history – marks its seventieth anniversary as the bedrock of transatlantic security. NATO is 
poised to bolster deterrence through larger and more frequent exercises, mobility and 
infrastructure improvements, a revamped command structure, and increased force presence in 
territories most vulnerable to Russian aggression. We are rapidly pursuing our “Four Thirties 
Readiness Initiative” by 2020: thirty mechanized battalions, thirty air squadrons, and thirty 
combat vessels ready to fight within thirty days or less. 
 
Over the last two years, NATO has made significant burden sharing progress, both financially 
and operationally. Since 2017, our NATO Allies have increased their defense spending by $41 
billion. The nine percent increase from 2016-2018 represents the largest in a quarter century. By 
2020, NATO projects Allies will increase defense spending by $100 billion. These are 
impressive numbers. Yet NATO contributions do not all boil down to simple dollar amounts. 
The Alliance continues to provide valuable manpower, specialized capabilities, and territory 
that no other partnership in the world can match.  
 
I now move to the impactful work we are doing by, with, and through our allies and partners 
across the Middle East and South Asia.  
 
In Syria and Iraq, the United States, as part of the seventy-nine-member Defeat-ISIS Coalition, 
and our local partners have liberated more than thirty towns and cities from ISIS control since 
January 2017 – that’s all of the territory ISIS once held. 
 
As we look ahead in Syria, we will continue to stand with those who fought and continue to 
fight alongside our Coalition, address Turkey’s security concerns along Syria’s northeast 
border, maintain the global Defeat-ISIS Coalition, and set conditions for continuing U.S. 
counterterrorism operations in the region. We fully support the Government of Iraq in its fight 
14 
   
against terrorism and will continue to enable the Iraqi Security Forces’ progress in securing 
liberated areas and thwarting ISIS attempts to mount a clandestine insurgency. 
 
In Afghanistan, we are executing President Trump’s South Asia Strategy, R4+S (regionalize, 
realign, reinforce, reconcile, and sustain). In applying military pressure on the Taliban, we 
support Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and Secretary Pompeo’s ongoing negotiations, which 
are Afghanistan’s first chance for real peace in forty years. We are also applying maximum 
pressure on ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K) and other terrorist groups in Afghanistan, to stymie any 
threats to the U.S. Homeland. 
 
Since 2016, our allies and partners have stepped up to create necessary conditions for 
negotiations. Afghan forces now lead one hundred percent of conventional ground missions. 
U.S. and coalition personnel perform train, advise, and assist roles, and the United States 
provides combat enablers to supplement Afghan capability gaps. In addition, U.S. and Afghan 
special forces regularly partner to conduct strikes against insurgents and terrorists. In 2018, 
international partners agreed to extend their roughly $1 billion in annual financial sustainment 
of Afghan forces through 2024. NATO’s fulfillment of requirements in Afghanistan has 
increased more than fourteen percent since the introduction of President Trump’s South Asia 
Strategy, its highest level in the Mission’s history. Since 2016, the number of non-U.S. 
Coalition troops to NATO’s Resolute Support Mission has increased by more than thirty-five 
percent, and two new countries, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, are formalizing their 
status as operational partners.  
 
Defeating Al Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and ISIS remains the United States’ top 
national security interest in Yemen. At the same time, we fully support UN Special Envoy 
Martin Griffiths’s efforts to bring all relevant parties of the civil war to the negotiating table. 
Though not easy, these is the necessary first step on the path to lasting peace.  
 
In Africa, we are helping partners build their security forces’ capacity to counter terrorist and 
other transnational threats, bolstering relationships to ensure U.S. influence and access against 
great power competition, enhancing our ability to conduct crisis response, and supporting 
whole-of-government efforts to advance stability and prosperity.   
 
The last stop in our abbreviated walk around the world is closer to home – to our allies and 
partners in the western hemisphere and our efforts to protect our southern border. Over the last 
year, we have fostered strong military-to-military ties with our Canadian and Mexican 
neighbors, while bolstering relationships with Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Chile. We 
appreciate and applaud these nations’ contributions to international security, demonstrated 
notably last year when Chile served as the Combined Forces Maritime Component Commander 
at RIMPAC – the first time in the exercise’s history a non-English speaking nation has done so. 
 
As we continue to monitor the situation in Venezuela, we are working closely with the 
Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, and regional partners to 
15 
   
provide humanitarian assistance, while maintaining our posture to protect our national interests 
and citizens abroad.  
 
On the southern border – in February, I visited the El Paso area to assess the security situation 
and DoD’s role in supporting our Department of Homeland Security partners. 
 
As these myriad examples illustrate, our thriving, global constellation of alliances and 
partnerships provides an asymmetric advantage no competitor or adversary can match. We take 
that advantage seriously, and we continue to foster its growth at every opportunity.  
 
Implementing Reform 
 
Let me now turn inward – to reform of our internal business practices. Over the last year, we 
have made marked improvements to our fiscal transparency, instituting a wide range of reform 
initiatives that bolster efficiency, effectiveness, and performance. 
 
We have focused reform in key areas, including healthcare, contract management, information 
technology (IT), acquisition, civilian resource management, and financial management. Let me 
provide a brief overview of our progress so far. Over the course of FY2017 and FY2018, we 
have saved $4.7 billion from reform across our headquarters’ activities – a down payment on 
more to come. 
 
On healthcare, we realized savings of almost $519 million in TRICARE reform in FY2018, 
with $3.4 billion in savings planned through FY2021.  Our entire Fourth Estate has now 
participated in contract service requirement reviews to eliminate unnecessary contracts, 
resulting in $492 million in programmed savings.  
 
Within the IT field, we modernized our defense travel system, trimming our regulation by 
almost 1,000 pages. The reform allows for better industry competition and has saved nearly 
$160 million to date. Within acquisition reform, our Services saved more than $550 million in 
FY2017 and FY2018 by selling equipment to foreign partners and negotiating multi-year 
procurements over single-year contracts.  
 
And within financial management, DoD completed our first-ever consolidated financial 
statement audit in 2018, covering roughly $2.7 trillion in assets. DoD has developed corrective 
action plans to address ninety-one percent of the total audit findings and recommendations, with 
more corrective actions to come.  
 
In addition to business reform, the Department has also made important structural reforms, 
including elevating U.S. Cyber Command to full combatant command status; standing up U.S. 
Army Futures Command; finalizing our split of the Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics 
office into two separate offices, Acquisition and Sustainment (A&S) and Research and 
Engineering (R&E); and appointing the Department’s first Chief Data Officer. 
16 
   
The Way Ahead 
 
Our Department has been busy, but we are just getting started. I am encouraged by our initial 
progress. Focus and discipline are vital for our NDS’s continued execution.  
 
 
OUR FY2020 REQUEST: A STRATEGY-DRIVEN BUDGET 
 
Our FY2018 funding stopped the erosion of our competitive edge by beginning to restore 
military readiness. Our FY2019 funding continued readiness gains and made key down 
payments on a more lethal military. Now our Department needs adequate, sustainable, and 
predictable funding to maintain momentum and expand our modernization and readiness 
efforts. Every line of our FY2020 request is designed to implement our Strategy. Therefore, 
every dollar of it – both in baseline funding and overseas contingency operations – is critical. I 
ask for Congress’s support for on-time funding of our $750 billion topline for National Defense, 
so we can continue to breathe life into the NDS. 
 
Our strategy-driven budget drives further progress along our three lines of effort and brings our 
military modernization efforts to life at the speed of relevance. It enables critical shifts to 
compete, deter, and win in any high-end fight of the future, while preserving capabilities to 
support current operations. With this funding, we ensure America maintains our asymmetric 
military advantage with a more lethal, agile, and innovative Joint Force. 
 
The FY2020 request includes the largest research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) 
budget in seventy years, when adjusted for inflation. That is $104 billion in total requested 
funds for FY2020 – $9 billion more than what we will spend this fiscal year. We have made 
strategic choices to prioritize lethality for the high-end fight.  
 
Across DoD, these choices move our capabilities from cost-accepting to cost-imposing, from 
the exquisite and purely survivable to the affordable and attritable. Through targeted 
investment, we will replace a federated approach with an enterprise one, enabling a more 
distributed, scaled path to innovation and modernization. This path prioritizes unmanned and 
machine capabilities, as well as the ability to “fight in the dark” without network dependency. 
 
With that broader context in mind, I will now focus on four priority areas: (1) Investing in the 
contested space and cyber domains; (2) modernizing in traditional air, maritime, and land 
domains, as well as multi-domain enterprises; (3) innovating in emerging technology fields to 
strengthen our competitive edge, and; (4) building on readiness gains to meet requirements for 
our current operational commitments and future challenges. 
 
 
 
 
17 
   
Space and Cyber Investments 
 
Our request recognizes the critically important role space will play in maintaining military 
superiority in the future. The $14.1 billion dedicated to space will counteract the erosion of our 
competitive advantage by enhancing our existing space-based capabilities, like GPS, satellite 
communications, and missile warning, as well as increasing launch capacities. We will also 
stand up the U.S. Space Force Headquarters, U.S. Space Command, and Space Development 
Agency to best prepare DoD to assure freedom of operation in space, deter attacks, and when 
necessary, defeat space and counter space threats to the United States, our allies, and our 
partners. 
 
We also note the cyber domain’s crucial role, both now and in warfare’s future. That is why we 
have requested $9.6 billion to support offensive and defensive cyberspace operations, shore up 
network resiliency against adversaries, and improve our cyber posture. These efforts help 
ensure DoD has the information and communications technology capabilities necessary for 
implementing our NDS and realizing our mission. 
 
Traditional and Multi-Domain Investments 
 
The FY2020 budget will ensure the U.S. military maintains long-term competitive advantage on 
land, in the air, and on the sea. Across these three traditional domains, we are investing a total 
of $107 billion for modernization.  
 
In the air domain, this includes $57.7 billion to increase the procurement and modernization of 
our fighter force. A balanced mix of fourth and fifth generation aircraft will effectively and 
affordably meet the entire spectrum of NDS missions, providing the stealth needed to gain air 
superiority, execute precision strikes, and conduct stand-in electronic attack against peer 
competitors in highly-contested environments, while also providing counter-air and strike in 
more permissive environments. We will also purchase additional tankers, Advanced Medium-
Range Air-to-Air missiles, and Joint Air-Surface extended range missiles.  
 
On land, we will invest $14.6 billion to fund roughly 6,400 combat and tactical vehicles, 
including M-1 Abrams upgrades and Amphibious Combat Vehicles, as well as multiple combat 
systems that provide overmatch on the last two hundred meters of the battlefield.  
 
In the maritime domain, we will increase and diversify our strike options, including offensive-
armed unmanned surface and underwater vessels and advanced long-range missiles. FY2020 
funds will also accelerate fleet growth, delivering more ships faster, including cutting edge 
unmanned variants. 
 
The FY2020 request also invests $14 billion in modernizing and recapitalizing all three legs of 
our nuclear capabilities, to include the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent system, Columbia-
class ballistic missile submarine, Long-Range Standoff Weapon, B-21 bomber, life-extended 
18 
   
Trident SLBM, and the F-35 dual-capable fighter aircraft; while also enhancing our missile 
warning and NC3 capabilities. 
 
We also slate $13.6 billion for missile defeat and defense modernization, increasing the 
capability and capacity of our ground-based defenses, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, 
and Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense systems; enhancing our space-based missile warning and 
other capabilities to address hypersonic threats; and developing boost-phase missile defense 
systems, including directed energy and air-launched kinetic interceptors.  
 
Also on the multi-domain front, we will invest $3.4 billion for our Special Operations Forces. 
The FY2020 request refocuses on strategic competition by increasing funding for research and 
development, modernization, and expanded capabilities for the high-end fight, while 
maintaining irregular warfare as a core competency.  
Innovation and Advanced Technology Investments 
 
With more than $7.4 billion directed toward DoD’s development and fielding of technologies 
focused on the high-end fight, the FY2020 budget prioritizes funding across four key emerging 
areas: autonomy, AI/machine learning, hypersonics, and directed energy.   
 
Let me expand on hypersonics for a moment as one example. Without the long-range, 
survivable, and fast strike capability of hypersonic weapons, it will be difficult for our military 
to maintain access to key regions or come to the defense of allies and partners in a crisis or war. 
Yet, with the $2.6 billion requested in FY2020, projected doubling of funding requests in 
coming years, and close inter-service cooperation, we are accelerating pursuit of options 
deliverable from land, sea, and air, with some capabilities expected to deploy to the warfighter 
three years earlier than previously planned. 
 
Sustainment and Readiness Investments 
 
This budget sustains our Joint Force and builds on critical readiness gains. We will invest 
almost $125 billion in operational readiness and sustainment, including $1.5 billion for 
advanced training facilities and ranges, $2.6 billion for improving and expanding cyber 
operations training, and $41.2 billion for further improving tactical aviation readiness.  
 
In addition, the FY2020 budget will allow an increase to our total end-strength by roughly 
7,700 Service Members over the projected FY2019 level, as well as give our men and women in 
uniform a much-deserved 3.1 percent pay raise, the largest in a decade. 
 
In concert with the funding priorities I have just outlined, we will continue to pursue 
opportunities that balance capacity and capability by realizing economies of scale in large 
equipment acquisitions, like aircraft carriers and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. As we do so, we 
will continue to assess the utility of our investments through a lifecycle lens.  
 
19 
   
CONCLUSION 
 
With Congress’s support and delivery of on-time funding at our requested topline, this budget 
ensures our military maintains the lethality, adaptability, and resiliency necessary to compete, 
deter, and win against any adversary in an increasingly dangerous world.  
 
It is a privilege and honor to lead the most lethal military in the world. I thank those in uniform 
and their families for all they do, today and every day, to keep us safe, and I appreciate the 
critical role Congress plays to ensure our warfighters are ready to succeed on the battlefields of 
today and tomorrow.  
 
The men and women of the Department of Defense stand ready, as always, to protect liberty 
and freedom.  
 
Thank you.

STATEMENT OF 
CHAIRMAN AJIT PAI 
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 
HEARING ON THE FCC’S FISCAL YEAR 2020 BUDGET REQUEST 
BEFORE THE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT 
U.S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
MAY 7, 2019 
Chairman Kennedy, Ranking Member Coons, and Members of the Financial Services and 
General Government Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here to present the Federal 
Communications Commission’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget Request.  The Commission’s Office of 
Management and Budget-designated spending level for FY20 is $335,660,000, derived exclusively from 
regulatory fees for regular FCC operations, and an auction spending cap of $132,538,680.   
But before I discuss the Commission’s plans for the next fiscal year, I want to take this 
opportunity to thank this Subcommittee for its support during the prior year.  We greatly appreciate your 
decision to provide us with funds above the FY19 request, as well as your permission to complete internal 
reorganizations to advance agency reform efforts. 
Let me highlight a few positive impacts of this Subcommittee’s decisions. 
First, you increased auction funding by more than $17 million.  The funds provided by this 
Subcommittee have enabled us to meet our statutory deadline to complete our rulemaking to implement 
changes to the TV Broadcaster Relocation Fund and provide money to reimburse low-power television, 
TV translator, and FM radio stations impacted by the post-Incentive Auction spectrum repack.  They have 
also helped us establish a dedicated call center and launch a public education campaign to assist 
consumers impacted by the relocation of broadcast stations.  And they have funded monthly reports to 
Subcommittee staff on our progress with respect to the repack.   
Second, you authorized two agency reorganization initiatives to help the Commission better carry 
out its mission.  You approved the creation of the Office of Economics and Analytics, which brought 
together economists who were previously scattered throughout the Commission.  The Office is already 
having a positive impact on the Commission’s work, and going forward, I am confident that it will allow 
us to continue expanding and deepening the use of economic analysis in the Commission’s decision-
making.  This Subcommittee also permitted us to transfer the audit and enforcement responsibilities 
associated with our Equal Employment Opportunity rules from the Media Bureau to the Enforcement 
Bureau.  This reorganization, which took place earlier this year, was supported by many civil rights 
organizations and will help us to more effectively enforce these rules.   
Third, you gave us nearly $6 million above our general request for FY19, which is supporting a 
broad range of Commission efforts essential to our core mission.  The FCC greatly appreciates your 
decision to return our funding to $339,000,000 in FY19.  This amount means a great deal to a small 
agency and aids our efforts to expand the deployment of rural broadband, improve public safety, foster 
technological innovation, protect consumers, and modernize our information technology. 
Turning to the future, I’d like to discuss some of the Commission’s most important priorities for 
next year—priorities that the funds requested in this budget submission are critical to advancing.   
First, we will continue our work to secure our nation’s leadership in 5G, the next generation of 
wireless connectivity.  5G networks will be 100 times faster than today’s networks, maybe even more.  
1 
They will have lag times that are a tenth of what they are today.  And they’ll have much more capacity, 
being able to connect as many as one million devices per square kilometer. 
Our work on 5G will open the door to new services and applications that will grow our economy 
and improve our standard of living.  Smart transportation networks will link connected cars—reducing 
traffic, preventing accidents, and limiting pollution.  Ubiquitous wireless sensors will enable healthcare 
professionals to remotely monitor your health and transmit data to your doctor before problems become 
emergencies.  Connected devices will empower farms to apply precision agriculture.  And there will be 
more innovations that we can’t even conceive of today. 
These breakthroughs will boost our economy.  One study pegs 5G’s potential at three million new 
jobs, $275 billion in private investment, and $500 billion in new economic growth. 
To realize this potential, we’ve developed a comprehensive strategy that will “Facilitate 
America’s Superiority in 5G Technology”; it’s called the “5G FAST” plan.  It has three key components: 
(1) pushing more spectrum into the marketplace; (2) promoting the deployment of wireless infrastructure; 
and (3) modernizing outdated regulations.  In my testimony today, I’d like to concentrate on the first 
prong, spectrum.   
The applications and services of tomorrow will require much more bandwidth.  They cannot be 
developed and deployed without spectrum.  This critical resource represents the lifeblood of the 
communications industry—and with it, the future of our economy.  That’s why the FCC must continue its 
work to aggressively make more spectrum available for commercial use.   
In my testimony to this Subcommittee last year, I said that the FCC would hold two high-band 
spectrum auctions during FY19: one for the 28 GHz band and another for the 24 GHz band.  And I noted 
that conducting these auctions successfully and promptly would be important to U.S. leadership in 5G.   
I am pleased to report that we have done what I said we would do.  Our 28 GHz auction began 
last November and concluded this January.  All in all, bidders won 2,965 licenses, and the auction raised 
$702,572,410 in gross bids for the U.S. Treasury.  Our 24 GHz auction began in March.  The clock phase 
of this auction ended in April, and the assignment phase is currently taking place.  Gross bids so far have 
more than doubled from the amount raised in the 28 GHz auction, to just short of $2 billion.    
While these auctions are significant accomplishments, the FCC cannot and will not rest on our 
laurels.  Instead, we will continue to free up spectrum for commercial use.  Starting on December 10, we 
will hold the largest auction in Commission history—we expect the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz 
bands will release 3.4 gigahertz of spectrum into the commercial marketplace.  During the next fiscal 
year, we also intend to auction mid-band spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band.  We will continue our work to 
make additional mid-band spectrum bands available for flexible use, including in the 2.5 GHz and 3.7-4.2 
GHz bands.    
All in all, these auctions will free up for the commercial marketplace over 5 gigahertz of 
spectrum for flexible use.  For context, that’s more spectrum than is currently used for mobile broadband 
by all mobile broadband providers in the United States combined. 
As part of our balanced spectrum strategy, we have also been working to make more spectrum 
available for unlicensed use.  Earlier this year, for example, we allocated over 21 gigahertz of spectrum 
above 95 GHz for unlicensed operations.  And we are continuing our effort to open up a large amount of 
unlicensed spectrum in the 6 GHz band, proposing to safeguard incumbents with innovative technologies 
and sharing techniques that will make sure we get the most use of this limited, essential resource. 
The second priority I’d like to address involves our continuing efforts to close the digital divide.  
Closing the digital divide has been my top priority since becoming chairman.  That’s why last year, the 
Commission took a variety of steps to better enable the private sector to deploy broadband infrastructure.  
2 
For example, we made it easier and cheaper for competitive providers to attach fiber to utility poles 
through a groundbreaking reform called “one-touch make ready.”   
Of course, there are some areas where the business case for broadband deployment just won’t 
exist—no matter how much red tape we cut.  These are typically rural areas with sparser populations and 
lower incomes.  The FCC manages programs to connect these rural communities through what is called 
the Universal Service Fund (USF).  And we’ve been aggressively taking action to maximize the USF’s 
impact—to stretch scarce dollars as far as we can.   
Last year, we finished a landmark reverse auction called Connect America Fund Phase II.  
Through this novel approach, we’re awarding about $1.5 billion to connect over 713,000 homes and 
businesses nationwide.  Before the auction, we identified parts of our country that were unserved by 
broadband.  This was so that we could target funding to leverage—not displace—private capital 
expenditures.  We didn’t want to fund overbuilding.  We also made sure the auction was open to 
providers of all types, including rural telecom companies, cable, fixed wireless, and satellite companies, 
ands well as electric utilities.  This ensured that there would be plenty of competition. 
The outcome of the auction was a tremendous success.  We distributed funding much more 
efficiently thanks in part to intermodal, competitive bidding, saving $3.5 billion from the $5 billion price 
we initially thought would be required to connect these unserved areas.  We also ensured that 99.7% of 
the winning bids would provide consumers with service of at least 25/3 Mbps.  And we set a level playing 
field that enabled a variety of entities, from fixed wireless to electric utilities, to win.  
Moreover, last December, we implemented reforms to the FCC’s Alternative Connect America 
Cost Model (A-CAM).  As a result, a total of 186 small, rural carriers participating in the A-CAM 
program have now accepted $65.7 million in additional annual support over the next decade to provide 
106,000 more rural homes and small businesses with 25/3 Mbps broadband service.  This represents a 
31.8% increase in the number of locations that will have high-quality service available through the FCC’s 
A-CAM program.  And the increase is much larger in many states, such as 105.4% in Montana and 92.4% 
in my home state of Kansas.  
In December, for the first time we also began requiring that small, rural carriers that continue to 
rely on the Commission’s legacy, cost-based support mechanism provide 25/3 Mbps broadband service to 
specific numbers of rural homes and small businesses in their service areas.  Under the prior 
Administration’s rules, these carriers were only required to provide 10/1 Mbps service to 115,441 
locations; under our new rules, these same carriers will have to provide 25/3 Mbps broadband to at least 
600,535 locations.  At the same time, we also initiated a second round of A-CAM offers of fixed, model-
based support for a term of ten years to these carriers, in exchange for building out 25/3 Mbps broadband 
to all fully-funded locations in their service areas.  If all legacy-reliant carriers accept the new A-CAM 
offers, they will be required to provide 25/3 Mbps service to at least 1,126,082 locations. 
Last year, we took other steps through the Fund to help close the digital divide as well.  For 
example, we increased the annual cap on rural healthcare program spending by nearly 43%, to $571 
million per year for that funding year–the first increase in the program’s funding level since it was 
established in the 1990s.  These additional funds will help to provide critical connectivity to rural 
healthcare institutions.   
And we plan to continue our emphasis on closing the digital divide.  Later this year, for example, 
we will begin a rulemaking to establish a $20.4 billion Rural Digital Opportunity Fund.  Applying lessons 
learned from the Connect America Fund Phase II reverse auction, this program will spur the deployment 
of high-speed broadband networks across more of rural America over the next decade, bringing greater 
economic opportunities to America’s heartland.  Service providers that win funding in the reverse auction 
will deploy needed infrastructure to provide up to gigabit-speed broadband in the parts of the country 
most in need of connectivity.  I’m excited about this program—it will be the FCC’s single biggest step yet 
3 
to close the digital divide and will connect up to four million rural homes and small businesses to high-
speed broadband networks. 
Of course, it is important that we spend USF funds wisely and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse 
in these programs.  That’s why last month, we sent you a reorganization plan to create a Fraud Division 
within the Enforcement Bureau.  I am pleased that this proposal was unanimously endorsed by the 
Commission and cleared by the Office of Management and Budget.  This reform will embed a permanent 
effort to combat USF fraud within the structure of the Enforcement Bureau.   
Our third priority is to continue fulfilling our important mission to protect public safety.  Last 
year, for example, we took important steps to improve Wireless Emergency Alerts, which play a critical 
role in notifying Americans when emergencies strike.   
In February, I visited the Orleans Parish Communications District, which is the 911 call-handling 
and dispatch center for the Crescent City.  And in March, I traveled to New Jersey and Delaware and 
visited 911 call centers.  These interactions underscored to me the importance of supporting those who 
work every day to help their fellow Americans in their time of need.  During the last fiscal year, we began 
work to implement laws passed by Congress to improve 911 calling.  For example, we proposed rules to 
implement Kari’s Law.  Kari’s Law requires multi-line telephone systems—which commonly serve 
hotels, office buildings, and campuses—to enable users to dial 911 directly.  And it also contains a 
notification requirement so that when a 911 call is made in these settings, a front desk or security office 
will be alerted to facilitate building entry by first responders.  We have proposed rules to help first 
responders locate wireless 911 callers in multi-story buildings.  In the coming year, the Commission 
intends to take further steps to improve 911 calling.  Among other things, I believe that we will be able to 
take final action to add a vertical, or “z-axis” metric to our location accuracy rules and finalize rules 
implementing Kari’s Law.   
Our work in this area also extends to national security and involves our review of foreign 
companies that seek to do business in the United States.  Later this week, at our May open meeting, the 
Commission will act to promote secure communications—a long-standing FCC priority.  In 2011, China 
Mobile USA, which is ultimately owned by the Chinese government, applied to the Commission seeking 
to provide international telecommunications services in the United States.  Consistent with agency policy, 
we solicited the views of the relevant federal agencies on whether the application raised national security, 
law enforcement, or related concerns. 
After a lengthy review of the application and in consultation with the U.S. intelligence 
community, in 2018, the Executive Branch agencies recommended that the FCC deny China Mobile 
USA’s application due to substantial national security and law enforcement concerns that cannot be 
resolved through an agreement with the company (called “voluntary mitigation”).  Notably, this is the 
first time the Executive Branch has ever recommended that the FCC deny an application due to national 
security concerns.  Based on this recommendation and the full public record in this proceeding, I have 
determined that approving this application would not serve the public interest.  At our May meeting, the 
Commission therefore will vote on an order that would deny China Mobile USA’s application. 
Going forward, we will continue to use our statutory authority to protect the people and overall 
security of United States.  That includes following through with our proposal to ban the use of money 
from the FCC’s Universal Service Fund from being used by recipients to procure equipment or services 
from companies that pose a national security threat to our communications networks or the 
communications supply chain.  
* * * 
I would like to conclude by highlighting the FCC’s most important resource: our staff.  Day in 
and day out, they come to work ready and eager to advance the public interest.  Whether they are working 
to expand broadband deployment, combat robocalls, promote wireless innovation, protect public safety, 
4 
or address consumer complaints, they serve the American people with skill and dedication, and I am 
honored to have them as colleagues.  The funds that you provide to our Commission enable them to do 
their jobs, and for that I am very grateful. 
Thank you for this opportunity to discuss this budget proposal.  I will be pleased to answer any 
questions that you may have.

PRESENTED 
MAY 7, 2019  
 
 
Good morning Chairman Moran, Ranking Member Shaheen, and members of the 
Subcommittee. 
 
Thank you for inviting me to appear before you today.  On behalf of the men and women 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), I want to thank this Committee for its substantial 
support in the Fiscal Year (“FY”) 2019 Appropriation.  The resources provided will allow the 
FBI to combat some of the most egregious national security and criminal threats; continue to 
partner with State, local, Tribal and other Federal agencies in a task force environment; and 
endeavor to keep pace with technological advancements employed by our adversaries. 
 
The funding provided is also imperative in allowing the FBI to retain its most precious 
assets — its personnel.  As the Committee is aware, FBI personnel are the life-force of the 
organization — they work tirelessly to combat some of the most complex and serious national 
security threats and crime problems challenging the Nation’s intelligence and law enforcement 
communities.   
 
Today, I appear before you on behalf of the men and women who tackle these threats and 
challenges every day.  I am extremely proud of their service and commitment to the FBI’s 
mission and to ensuring the safety and security of communities throughout our nation.  On their 
behalf, I would like to express my appreciation for the support you have given them in the past, 
ask for your continued support in the future, and pledge to be the best possible stewards of the 
resources you provide.   
 
I would like to begin by providing a brief overview of the FBI’s FY 2020 budget request, 
and then follow with a short discussion of key threats and challenges that we face, both as a 
nation and as an organization.   
 
FY 2020 Budget Request Overview 
 
The FY 2020 budget request proposes a total of $9.31 billion in direct budget authority to 
carry out the FBI’s national security, criminal law enforcement, and criminal justice services 
missions. The request includes a total of $9.26 billion for Salaries and Expenses, which will 
support 35,558 positions (13,201 Special Agents, 3,115 Intelligence Analysts, and 19,242 
professional staff), and $51.9 million for Construction.   
 
As a result of this budget being formulated before the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
2019, was passed, it was built utilizing the prior year enacted level as a starting point. The 
request does, however, include six program enhancements totaling $144.9 million.  These 
enhancements are proposed to meet critical requirements and close gaps in operational 
capabilities, including:  $70.5 million to enhance cyber investigative capabilities; $18.3 million 
to mitigate threats from foreign intelligence services; $16.6 million to support the National 
Vetting Center, $18.2 million to target and disrupt transnational organized crime financial and 
Darknet networks; $4.2 million to increase the capacity to perform National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System (“NICS”) services; and $17.2 million to enhance the FBI’s ability to 
render safe a weapon of mass destruction. 
 
The request also includes two rescissions from funding appropriated in prior fiscal years 
— $60 million from the FBI’s Salaries and Expenses account and $159 million from the FBI’s 
Construction account. 
 
When compared against the FY 2019 enacted level, the FY 2020 request level represents 
a total decrease of $267.8 million, including an increase of $65.3 million in the Salaries and 
Expenses account and a reduction of $333.1 million in the FBI’s Construction account.  
 
 
Key Threats and Challenges 
 
This Committee has provided critical resources for the FBI to become what it is today — 
a threat-focused, intelligence-driven organization. Our nation continues to face a multitude of 
serious and evolving threats ranging from homegrown violent extremists to hostile foreign 
intelligence services and operatives; from sophisticated cyber-based attacks to internet facilitated 
sexual exploitation of children; from violent gangs and criminal organizations to public 
corruption and corporate fraud.  Keeping pace with these threats is a significant challenge for the 
FBI.  As an organization, we must be able to stay current with constantly evolving technologies.  
Our adversaries — terrorists, foreign intelligence services, and criminals — take advantage of 
modern technology, including the Internet and social media, to facilitate illegal activities, recruit 
followers, encourage terrorist attacks and other illicit actions, and to disperse information on 
building improvised explosive devices and other means to attack the U.S.  The breadth of these 
threats and challenges are as complex as any time in our history.  And the consequences of not 
responding to and countering threats and challenges have never been greater.  
 
- 2 - 
 
The support of this Committee in helping the FBI do its part in facing and thwarting these 
threats and challenges is greatly appreciated.  That support is allowing us to establish strong 
capabilities and capacities for assessing threats, sharing intelligence, leveraging key technologies, 
and — in some respects, most importantly — hiring some of the best to serve as Special Agents, 
Intelligence Analysts, and professional staff.  We have built and are continuously enhancing a 
workforce that possesses the skills and knowledge to deal with the complex threats and 
challenges we face today — and tomorrow.  We are building a leadership cadre that views 
change and transformation as a positive tool for keeping the FBI focused on the key threats 
facing our nation.   
 
Today’s FBI is a national security and law enforcement organization that uses, collects, 
and shares intelligence in everything we do. Each FBI employee understands that, to defeat the 
key threats facing our nation, we must constantly strive to be more efficient and more effective. 
Just as our adversaries continue to evolve, so, too, must the FBI. We live in a time of acute and 
persistent terrorist and criminal threats to our national security, our economy, and indeed our 
communities. These diverse threats underscore the complexity and breadth of the FBI’s mission: 
to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States. 
 
 
National Security 
 
Counterterrorism 
 
Preventing terrorist attacks remains the FBI’s top priority.  However, the threat posed by 
terrorism — both international terrorism (“IT”) and domestic terrorism (“DT”) — has evolved 
significantly since 9/11.  
 
The most persistent threats to the Nation and to U.S. interests abroad are homegrown 
violent extremists (“HVEs”), domestic terrorists, and foreign terrorist organizations (“FTOs”).  
The IT threat to the U.S. has expanded from sophisticated, externally directed FTO plots to 
include individual attacks carried out by HVEs who are inspired by designated terrorist 
organizations. We remain concerned that groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham 
(“ISIS”) and al Qaeda have the intent to carry out large-scale attacks in the U.S. 
  
The FBI assesses HVEs are the greatest terrorism threat to the homeland. These 
individuals are global jihad-inspired individuals who are in the U.S., have been radicalized 
primarily in the U.S., and are not receiving individualized direction from FTOs. We, along with 
our law enforcement partners, face significant challenges in identifying and disrupting HVEs. 
This is due, in part, to their lack of a direct connection with an FTO, an ability to rapidly 
mobilize, and the use of encrypted communications.   
 
 
- 3 - 
In recent years, prolific use of social media by FTOs has greatly enhanced their ability to 
disseminate messages. We have also been confronting a surge in terrorist propaganda and 
training available via the Internet and social media. Due to online recruitment and indoctrination, 
FTOs are no longer dependent on finding ways to get terrorist operatives into the United States to 
recruit and carry out acts of terrorism. Terrorists in ungoverned spaces — both physical and 
cyber — readily disseminate propaganda and training materials to attract easily influenced 
individuals around the world to their cause. They motivate these individuals to act at home or 
encourage them to travel. This is a significant transformation from the terrorist threat our nation 
faced a decade ago.   
 
Despite significant losses of territory, ISIS remains relentless and ruthless in its campaign 
of violence against the West and has aggressively promoted its hateful message, attracting like-
minded extremists. The message is not tailored solely to those who overtly express signs of 
radicalization. It is seen by many who click through the Internet every day, receive social media 
notifications, and participate in social networks. Ultimately, many of the individuals drawn to 
ISIS seek a sense of belonging. Echoing other terrorist groups, ISIS has advocated for lone 
offender attacks in Western countries. Recent ISIS videos and propaganda have specifically 
advocated for attacks against soldiers, law enforcement, and intelligence community personnel.   
 
Many foreign terrorist organizations use various digital communication platforms to 
reach individuals they believe may be susceptible and sympathetic to extremist messages. 
However, no group has been as successful at drawing people into its perverse ideology as ISIS, 
who has proven dangerously competent at employing such tools. ISIS uses high-quality, 
traditional media platforms, as well as widespread social media campaigns to propagate its 
extremist ideology. With the broad distribution of social media, terrorists can spot, assess, 
recruit, and radicalize vulnerable persons of all ages in the U.S. either to travel or to conduct an 
attack on the homeland. Through the Internet, terrorists overseas now have direct access to our 
local communities to target and recruit our citizens and spread the message of radicalization 
faster than was imagined just a few years ago.   
 
The threats posed by foreign fighters, including those recruited from the U.S., are very 
dynamic. We will continue working to identify individuals who seek to join the ranks of foreign 
fighters traveling in support of ISIS, those foreign fighters who may attempt to return to the 
United States, and HVEs who may aspire to attack the United States from within.   
 
ISIS is not the only terrorist group of concern. Al Qaeda maintains its desire for large-
scale, spectacular attacks. However, continued counterterrorism pressure has degraded the group, 
and in the near term al Qaeda is more likely to focus on supporting small-scale, readily 
achievable attacks against U.S. and allied interests in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region. 
Simultaneously, over the last year, propaganda from al Qaeda leaders seeks to inspire individuals 
to conduct their own attacks in the U.S. and the West.   
 
 
- 4 - 
In addition to FTOs, domestic extremist movements collectively pose a steady threat of 
violence and economic harm to the United States. Trends within individual movements may 
shift, but the underlying drivers for domestic extremism — such as perceptions of government or 
law enforcement overreach, socio-political conditions, and reactions to legislative actions — 
remain constant. The FBI is most concerned about lone offender attacks, primarily shootings, as 
they have served as the dominant mode for lethal domestic extremist violence. We anticipate law 
enforcement, racial minorities, and the U.S. government will continue to be significant targets for 
many domestic extremist movements.   
 
As the threat to harm the United States and U.S. interests evolves, we must adapt and 
confront these challenges, relying heavily on the strength of our federal, State, local, and 
international partnerships. The FBI uses all lawful investigative techniques and methods to 
combat these terrorist threats to the United States. Along with our domestic and foreign partners, 
we are collecting and analyzing intelligence concerning the ongoing threat posed by foreign 
terrorist organizations and homegrown violent extremists. We continue to encourage information 
sharing, which is evidenced through our partnerships with many federal, State, local, and Tribal 
agencies assigned to Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country. Be assured, the FBI 
continues to strive to work and share information more efficiently, and to pursue a variety of 
lawful methods to help stay ahead of these threats.  The FBI’s FY 2020 Request includes 48 
positions (including two Special Agents) and $16.6 million to support technical and analytical 
capabilities related to Counterterrorism vetting efforts. 
 
Counterintelligence 
 
The Nation faces a continuing threat, both traditional and asymmetric, from hostile 
foreign intelligence agencies.  Traditional espionage, often characterized by career foreign 
intelligence officers acting as diplomats or ordinary citizens, and asymmetric espionage, typically 
carried out by students, researchers, or businesspeople operating front companies, is prevalent.  
Foreign intelligence services not only seek our nation’s state and military secrets, but they also 
target commercial trade secrets, research and development, and intellectual property, as well as 
insider information from the Federal Government, U.S. corporations, and American universities. 
Foreign intelligence services continue to employ more creative and more sophisticated methods 
to steal innovative technology, critical research and development data, and intellectual property, 
in an effort to erode America’s economic leading edge.  These illicit activities pose a significant 
threat to national security and continue to be a priority and focus of the FBI.   
 
Foreign influence operations — which include covert actions by foreign governments to 
influence U.S. political sentiment or public discourse — are not a new problem. But the 
interconnectedness of the modern world, combined with the anonymity of the Internet, have 
changed the nature of the threat and how the FBI and its partners must address it. The goal of 
these foreign influence operations directed against the United States is to spread disinformation, 
sow discord, and, ultimately, undermine confidence in our democratic institutions and values.  
Foreign influence operations have taken many forms and used many tactics over the years. Most 
 
- 5 - 
widely reported these days are attempts by adversaries—hoping to reach a wide swath of 
Americans covertly from outside the United States — to use false personas and fabricated stories 
on social media platforms to discredit U.S. individuals and institutions.  However, other 
influence operations include targeting U.S. officials and other U.S. persons through traditional 
intelligence tradecraft; criminal efforts to suppress voting and provide illegal campaign 
financing; cyber attacks against voting infrastructure, along with computer intrusions targeting 
elected officials and others; and a whole slew of other kinds of influence, like both overtly and 
covertly manipulating news stories, spreading disinformation, leveraging economic resources, 
and escalating divisive issues. 
 
Almost two years ago, I established the Foreign Influence Task Force (“FITF”) to identify 
and counteract malign foreign influence operations targeting the United States.  The FITF is 
uniquely positioned to combat this threat.  The task force now brings together the FBI’s expertise 
across the waterfront — counterintelligence, cyber, criminal, and even counterterrorism — to 
root out and respond to foreign influence operations.  Task force personnel work closely with 
other U.S. government agencies and international partners concerned about foreign influence 
efforts aimed at their countries, using three key pillars.  Currently there are open investigations 
with a foreign influence nexus spanning FBI field offices across the country.  Second, we are 
focused on information and intelligence-sharing.  The FBI is working closely with partners in the 
Intelligence Community and in the federal government, as well as with State and local partners, 
to establish a common operating picture.  The FITF is also working with international partners to 
exchange intelligence and strategies for combating what is a shared threat.  The third pillar of our 
approach is based on strong relationships with the private sector.  Technology companies have a 
front-line responsibility to secure their own networks, products, and platforms. But the FBI is 
doing its part by providing actionable intelligence to better enable the private sector to address 
abuse of their platforms by foreign actors. Over the last year, the FBI has met with top social 
media and technology companies several times, provided them with classified briefings, and 
shared specific threat indicators and account information, so they can better monitor their own 
platforms.   
 
But this is not just an election-cycle threat. Our adversaries are continuously trying to 
undermine our country, whether it is election season or not.  As a result, the FBI must remain 
vigilant.   
 
In addition to the threat posed by foreign influence, the FBI is also concerned about 
foreign investment by hostile nation states.  Over the course of the last seven years, foreign 
investment in the U.S. has more than doubled.  Concurrent with this growth, foreign direct 
investment (“FDI”) in the U.S. has increasingly become a national security concern, as hostile 
nations leverage FDI to buy U.S. assets that will advance their intelligence, military, technology, 
and economic goals at the expense of U.S. national security.  The Committee on Foreign 
Investment in the U.S. (“CFIUS”), an Executive Branch committee chaired by the Department of 
Treasury, was statutorily created to address potential risks to U.S. national security resulting from 
foreign acquisitions or mergers with U.S. companies.  As part of this process, the FBI provides 
 
- 6 - 
input and analysis to the National Intelligence Council within eight days of a CFIUS filing and a 
risk assessment to the Department of Justice within 30 days of a CFIUS filing.  As a result of the 
Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (“FIRRMA”), which was enacted last year, 
the FBI anticipates its workload to increase dramatically.   
 
The FY 2020 Request includes six positions (including one Special Agent) and $18.3 
million to address the threats posed by foreign influence and foreign investment in the United 
States. 
 
Cyber Threats 
 
Virtually every national security threat and crime problem the FBI faces is cyber-based or 
facilitated.  We face sophisticated cyber threats from state-sponsored hackers, hackers for hire, 
organized cyber syndicates, and terrorists.  On a daily basis, cyber-based actors seek our state 
secrets, our trade secrets, our technology, and our ideas — things of incredible value to all of us 
and of great importance to the conduct of our government business and our national security.  
They seek to strike our critical infrastructure and to harm our economy. 
 
As the committee is well aware, the frequency and impact of cyber-attacks on our 
Nation’s private sector and government networks have increased dramatically in the past decade 
and are expected to continue to grow.  We continue to see an increase in the scale and scope of 
reporting on malicious cyber activity that can be measured by the amount of corporate data stolen 
or deleted, personally identifiable information compromised, or remediation costs incurred by 
U.S. victims. Within the FBI, we are focused on the most dangerous malicious cyber activity: 
high-level intrusions by state-sponsored hackers and global organized crime syndicates, as well 
as other technically sophisticated attacks.  FBI agents, analysts, and computer scientists are using 
technical capabilities and traditional investigative techniques — such as sources, court-
authorized electronic surveillance, physical surveillance, and forensics — to fight the full range 
of cyber threats.  And we continue to actively coordinate with our private and public partners to 
pierce the veil of anonymity surrounding cyber based crimes. 
 
Botnets used by cyber criminals have been responsible for billions of dollars in damages 
over the past several years. The widespread availability of malicious software (malware) that can 
create botnets allows individuals to leverage the combined bandwidth of thousands, if not 
millions, of compromised computers, servers, or network-ready devices to conduct attacks. 
Cyber threat actors have also increasingly conducted ransomware attacks against U.S. systems, 
encrypting data and rendering systems unusable —  thereby victimizing individuals, businesses, 
and even public health providers. 
 
Cyber threats are not only increasing in size and scope, but are also becoming 
increasingly difficult to investigate.  Cyber criminals often operate through online forums, selling 
illicit goods and services, including tools that can be used to facilitate cyber attacks. These 
criminals have also increased the sophistication of their schemes, which are more difficult to 
 
- 7 - 
detect and more resilient than ever. Cyber threats are also becoming increasingly difficult to 
investigate. For instance, many cyber actors are based abroad or obfuscate their identities by 
using foreign infrastructure, making coordination with international law enforcement partners 
essential. 
 
The FBI is engaged in a myriad of efforts to combat cyber threats, from improving threat 
identification and information sharing inside and outside of the government to developing and 
retaining new talent, to examining the way we operate to disrupt and defeat these threats.  We 
take all potential threats to public and private sector systems seriously and will continue to 
investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace.  The FY 2020 Request 
includes 33 positions (including three Special Agents) and $70.5 million to enhance cyber 
information-sharing abilities and increase cyber tools and capacities. 
 
 
Criminal Threats 
 
We face many criminal threats, from complex white-collar fraud in the financial, health 
care, and housing sectors to transnational and regional organized criminal enterprises to violent 
crime and public corruption. Criminal organizations — domestic and international — and 
individual criminal activity represent a significant threat to our security and safety in 
communities across the Nation. A key tenet of protecting the Nation from those who wish to do 
us harm is the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS.  The goal of NICS 
is to ensure that guns do not fall into the wrong hands, and also to ensure the timely transfer of 
firearms to eligible gun buyers.  Mandated by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 
1993 and launched by the FBI on November 30, 1998, NICS is used by Federal Firearms 
Licensees (“FFLs”) to instantly determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to purchase 
firearms.  NICS receives information from tens of thousands of FFLs and checks to ensure that 
applicants do not have a criminal record or are not otherwise prohibited and therefore ineligible 
to purchase a firearm. In the first complete month of operation in 1998, a total of 892,840 firearm 
background checks were processed; in 2018, almost 2.2 million checks were processed per 
month. 
 
While most checks are completed by electronic searches of the NICS database within 
minutes, a small number of checks require examiners to review records and resolve missing or 
incomplete information before an application can be approved or rejected.  Ensuring the timely 
processing of these inquiries is important to ensure law abiding citizens can exercise their right to 
purchase a firearm and to protect communities from prohibited and therefore ineligible 
individuals attempting to acquire a firearm. The FBI is currently processing a record number of 
checks, over 26 million were processed in 2018 — an increase of almost 950,000 checks.  The 
FY 2020 Request includes 40 positions and $4.2 million to increase the capacity to process NICS 
checks within the mandated timeframe and to meet new requirements included in the Fix NICS 
Act.

Violent Crime 
 
Violent crimes and gang activities exact a high toll on individuals and communities. 
Many of today’s gangs are sophisticated and well organized and use violence to control 
neighborhoods, and boost their illegal money-making activities, which include robbery, drug and 
gun trafficking, fraud, extortion, and prostitution rings. These gangs do not limit their illegal 
activities to single jurisdictions or communities. The FBI is able to work across such lines, which 
is vital to the fight against violent crime in big cities and small towns across the Nation. Every 
day, FBI special agents work in partnership with federal, State, local, and Tribal officers and 
deputies on joint task forces and individual investigations. 
 
FBI joint task forces — Violent Crime Safe Streets, Violent Gang Safe Streets, and Safe 
Trails — focus on identifying and targeting major groups operating as criminal enterprises. Much 
of the FBI criminal intelligence is derived from our State, local, and Tribal law enforcement 
partners, who know their communities inside and out. Joint task forces benefit from FBI 
surveillance assets, and our sources track these gangs to identify emerging trends. Through these 
multi-subject and multi-jurisdictional investigations, the FBI concentrates its efforts on high-
level groups engaged in patterns of racketeering. This investigative model enables us to target 
senior gang leadership and to develop enterprise-based prosecutions. 
 
By way of example, the FBI has dedicated tremendous resources to combat the threat of 
violence posed by MS-13. The atypical nature of this gang has required a multi-pronged 
approach — we work through our task forces here in the U.S. while simultaneously gathering 
intelligence and aiding our international law enforcement partners. We do this through the FBI’s 
Transnational Anti-Gang Task Forces (“TAGs”). Established in El Salvador in 2007 through the 
FBI’s National Gang Task Force, Legal Attaché (“Legat”) San Salvador, and the United States 
Department of State, each TAG is a fully operational unit responsible for the investigation of 
MS-13 operating in the northern triangle of Central America and threatening the United States. 
This program combines the expertise, resources, and jurisdiction of participating agencies 
involved in investigating and countering transnational criminal gang activity in the United States 
and Central America. There are now TAGs in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Through 
these combined efforts, the FBI has achieved substantial success in countering the MS-13 threat 
across the United States and Central America. 
 
Despite these efforts, we still have work to do. There are still jurisdictions that are 
struggling.  The latest Uniform Crime Reporting statistics gathered from the Crime in the United 
States, 2017 show the number of violent crimes in the Nation decrease by 0.2 percent compared 
with the 2016 estimate.  The 2018 Preliminary Uniform Crime Report indicates a similar trend. 
We are committed to working with our federal, State, local, and Tribal partners in a 
coordinated effort to reduce crime in the United States.

Transnational Organized Crime (“TOC”) and Opioids 
 
More than a decade ago, organized crime was characterized by hierarchical organizations, 
or families, that exerted influence over criminal activities in neighborhoods, cities, or States. But 
organized crime has changed dramatically. Today, international criminal enterprises run multi- 
national, multi-billion-dollar schemes from start to finish. Modern-day criminal enterprises are 
flat, fluid networks with global reach.  While still engaged in many of the “traditional” organized 
crime activities of loan-sharking, extortion, and murder, modern criminal enterprises are 
targeting stock market fraud and manipulation, cyber-facilitated bank fraud and embezzlement, 
drug trafficking, identity theft, human trafficking, money laundering, alien smuggling, public 
corruption, weapons trafficking, extortion, kidnapping, and other illegal activities.  TOC 
networks exploit legitimate institutions for critical financial and business services that enable the 
storage or transfer of illicit proceeds.  Preventing and combating transnational organized crime 
demands a concentrated effort by the FBI and federal, State, local, Tribal, and international 
partners.   
 
While the FBI continues to share intelligence about criminal groups with our partners and 
combines resources and expertise to gain a full understanding of each group, the threat of 
transnational crime remains a significant and growing threat to national and international security 
with implications for public safety, public health, democratic institutions and economic stability 
across the globe.  Because of this, the FBI’s FY 2020 Request includes $18.2 million to 
strategically target TOC networks across the globe and to develop solutions to effectively disrupt 
and dismantle Darknet financial networks and transnational money laundering groups. 
 
Illicit drug trafficking continues to be a growing threat.  Large amounts of high-quality, 
low cost heroin and illicit fentanyl are contributing to record numbers of overdose deaths and 
life-threatening addictions nationwide. The accessibility and convenience of the drug trade online 
contributes to the opioid epidemic in the United States.  Transnational criminal organizations 
(“TCOs”) are introducing synthetic opioids to the U.S. market, including fentanyl and fentanyl 
analogs. To address this evolving threat, we are taking a multi-faceted approach and establishing 
many initiatives and units across our criminal program. 
 
In January 2018, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General directed the FBI and other 
federal law enforcement partners to develop a strategic plan to disrupt and dismantle the Darknet 
illicit marketplaces facilitating the distribution of fentanyl and other opioids.  As a result, the FBI 
established the Joint Criminal Opioid Darknet Enforcement (“J-CODE”) Initiative, which brings 
together agents, analysts, and professional staff with expertise in drugs, gangs, health care fraud, 
and more, with federal, State, and local law enforcement partners from across the U.S. 
Government.  The J-CODE team has developed a comprehensive, multi-pronged criminal 
enterprise strategy to target the trafficking of fentanyl and other opioids on the Darknet and 
Clearnet.  This strategy focuses on identifying and infiltrating the marketplace administrative 
team, analyzing financial information, locating and exploiting marketplace infrastructure, 
targeting vendors and buyers, and enabling field office success in the investigation and 
 
- 10 - 
prosecution of these marketplaces.  As a result, numerous investigations and operations have 
been initiated and several online vendors who are facilitating the trafficking of opioids via the 
Internet, to include fentanyl, have been disrupted. 
 
The FBI is also addressing this threat through the Prescription Drug Initiative (“PDI”). The PDI 
was established in 2016 in response to the substantial and increasing threat associated with 
prescription drug diversion, and in particular, the staggering national increase in opioid-related 
deaths. The objective of the PDI is to identify and target criminal enterprises and other groups 
engaged in prescription drug schemes; identify and prosecute, where appropriate, organizations 
with improper corporate policies related to prescription drugs; and identify and prosecute, where 
appropriate, organizations with improper prescribing and dispensing practices. The PDI 
prioritizes investigations which target “gatekeeper” positions, to include medical professionals 
and pharmacies that divert opioids outside the scope of their medical practice and/or distribute 
these medications with no legitimate medical purpose. Since its inception, the PDI has resulted in 
the conviction of numerous medical professionals and secured significant federal prison 
sentences, to include life terms for physicians who cause harm or death to the patients entrusted 
to their care.  
 
 
Beyond these two programs, the FBI has dedicated additional resources to address this 
expansive threat. We have more than doubled the number of Transnational Organized Crime 
Task Forces, expanded the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (“OCDETF”) 
Airport Initiative to focus on insider threats partnering with TCO actors, and created and led the 
Fentanyl Safety Working Group at FBI Headquarters, which has led to a new program to protect 
field agents and support employees with personal protective equipment (“PPE”) and opioid 
antagonists (i.e. naloxone) from the threat of fentanyl exposure. The FBI participated, along with 
other federal partners, in the creation of the Heroin Availability Reduction Plan (“HARP”), takes 
part in monthly HARP meetings hosted by the Office of National Drug Control Policy 
(“ONDCP”), and continues to provide training to our international law enforcement partners on 
successful identification, seizure, and neutralization of clandestine heroin/fentanyl laboratories. 
 
Crimes Against Children and Human Trafficking 
 
It is unthinkable, but every year, thousands of children become victims of crimes — 
whether it is through kidnappings, violent attacks, sexual abuse, human trafficking or online 
predators. The FBI is uniquely positioned to provide a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive 
response; identify, locate, and recover child victims; and strengthen relationships between the 
FBI and federal, State, local, Tribal, and international law enforcement partners to identify, 
prioritize, investigate, and deter individuals and criminal networks from exploiting children.   
 
The FBI has several programs in place to arrest child predators and to recover missing 
and endangered children.  To this end, the FBI funds or participates in a variety of endeavors, 
including our Innocence Lost National Initiative, Innocent Images National Initiative, Operation 
 
- 11 - 
Cross Country, Child Abduction Rapid Deployment Teams, Victim Services, 80 Child 
Exploitation Task Forces, 53 International Violent Crimes Against Children Task Force Officers, 
as well as numerous community outreach programs to educate parents and children about safety 
measures they can follow. 
 
Currently, there are at least 30 child pornography sites operating openly and notoriously 
on the Dark Net, including the Tor network.  Some of these child pornography sites are 
exclusively dedicated to the sexual abuse of infants and toddlers.  The sites often expand rapidly, 
with one site obtaining 150,000 new members within its first seven weeks of operation.  The FBI 
combats this pernicious crime problem through investigations such as Operation Pacifier, which 
targeted the administrators and users of a highly-sophisticated, Tor-based global enterprise 
dedicated to the sexual exploitation of children.  This multi-year operation has led to the arrest of 
over 348 individuals based in the United States, the prosecution of 25 American child 
pornography producers and 51 American hands-on abusers, the rescue or identification of 55 
American children, the arrest of 548 international individuals, and the identification or rescue of 
296 children abroad.     
 
Child Abduction Rapid Deployment Teams are ready response teams stationed across the 
country to quickly respond to abductions. Investigators bring to this issue the full array of 
forensic tools such as DNA analysis, trace evidence, impression evidence, and digital forensics. 
Through improved communications, law enforcement also has the ability to quickly share 
information with partners throughout the world, and these outreach programs play an integral 
role in prevention. 
 
In addition to programs to combat child exploitation, the FBI also focuses efforts to stop 
human trafficking — a modern form of slavery.  The majority of human trafficking victims 
recovered during FBI investigations are United States citizens, but traffickers are opportunists 
who will exploit any victim with a vulnerability. Victims of human trafficking are subjected to 
forced labor or sex trafficking, and the FBI is working hard with its partners to combat both 
forms.   
 
The FBI works collaboratively with law enforcement partners to investigate and arrest 
human traffickers through Human Trafficking Task Forces nationwide.  We take a victim-
centered, trauma-informed approach to investigating these cases and strive to ensure the needs of 
victims are fully addressed at all stages. To accomplish this, the FBI works in conjunction with 
other law enforcement agencies and victim specialists on the local, State, Tribal, and federal 
levels, as well as with a variety of vetted non-governmental organizations. Even after the arrest 
and conviction of human traffickers, the FBI often continues to work with partner agencies and 
organizations to assist victims in moving beyond their exploitation. 
 
Earlier this year, the FBI announced the results of an 11-day effort by the Violent Crimes 
Against Children/Human Trafficking Program and the Metro Atlanta Child Exploitation 
(“MATCH”) Task Force. The effort, leading up to Super Bowl LIII, was collaborated with over 
 
- 12 - 
25 local, State, and federal law enforcement agencies and District Attorney’s Offices, along with 
seven non-government organizations.  From January 23, 2019 to February 2, 2019, the 
operation’s goal was to raise awareness about sex trafficking by proactively addressing that threat 
during the Super Bowl and events leading up to the Super Bowl. This event led to 169 arrests, 
including 26 traffickers and 34 individuals attempting to engage in sex acts with minors; nine 
juvenile sex trafficking victims recovered (the youngest was 14 years of age); and nine adult 
human trafficking victims identified.  Trafficking is not just a problem during large-scale events 
— it is a 365 day-a-year problem in communities all across the country.   
 
The FBI commends the Committee’s dedication to these efforts and appreciates the 
resources provided to combat these horrific acts. 
 
 
Key Cross-Cutting Capabilities and Capacities 
 
I would like to briefly highlight some key cross-cutting capabilities and capacities that are 
critical to our efforts in each of the threat and crime problems described. 
 
Operational and Information Technology 
 
As criminal and terrorist threats become more diverse and dangerous, the role of 
technology becomes increasingly important to our efforts. The FBI is using technology to 
improve the way we collect, analyze, and share information. We have seen significant 
improvement in capabilities over the past decade; but keeping pace with technology remains a 
key concern for the future. 
 
The volume of data collected in the course of investigations continues to rapidly expand.  
In the case of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, the FBI recovered one petabyte of data.  Insufficient 
network bandwidth and tools necessitated the need for 260 FBI personnel to work over 10 days 
to manually review 21,500 hours of video footage.  These bandwidth and data challenges are not 
limited to major cases or large offices.  It is not uncommon for FBI investigations to generate 
more than one terabyte of data per day, an amount that could normally take two days to transit 
FBI networks at current bandwidth levels.  As a result, the FBI has made dedicated efforts to 
upgrade and transform its information technology platforms to meet the demands of current and 
future investigations. To keep pace in an era where investigations and analysis will increasingly 
be conducted at the petabyte scale, the FBI needs to build networks that can move bulk data, 
modernize investigative data analysis, and reduce reliance on stand-alone, ad-hoc systems.    
 
A key tenet of this transformation is the integration of Data Analysts (“DA”) in field 
offices nationwide.  A DA is able to clean, standardize, enrich, and visualize data using computer 
programming and statistical techniques to provide products to the investigative team to further 
investigative matters.  They are able to create code tailored to intelligence and investigative 
requirements to triage and prioritize vast amounts of data received by investigative teams, 
 
- 13 - 
enabling efficient follow-on analysis; convert thousands of location points contained in cellphone 
call and data records into a usable format for follow-on network and geospatial analysis; and 
combine dozens of differently formatted files into an easy-to-read, consolidated format, free of 
duplicate and inconsistent information.  In FY 2018, the FBI piloted the DA program by sending 
analysts to several FBI Field Offices. The DAs helped those offices address several of their most 
critical data challenges, and were able to solve volume, velocity, and geospatial data issues.  In 
one instance, investigators wanted to determine what businesses a credit card skimming subject 
visited to place money orders. The DA converted hundreds of pages of call detail records to a 
machine readable format, plotted location points onto a map to show the subject’s location over 
time, and calculated the proximity to vendors where fraudulent activity may have occurred.  The 
DA’s mapping product not only provided pattern of life information (leading to the discovery of 
new investigative leads), but also saved investigators days, if not weeks.  The FY 2020 Request 
expands the 2018 pilot program by requesting an additional 25 Data Analysts to deploy to the 
most critical field offices. The FBI will continue to monitor and measure the success of this 
program. 
 
The FBI Laboratory is one of the largest and most comprehensive forensic laboratories in 
the world. Operating out of a facility in Quantico, Virginia, laboratory personnel travel the world 
on assignment, using science and technology to protect the Nation and support law enforcement, 
intelligence, military, and forensic science partners. The Lab’s many services include providing 
expert testimony, mapping crime scenes, and conducting forensic exams of physical and 
hazardous evidence. Lab personnel possess expertise in many areas of forensics supporting law 
enforcement and intelligence purposes, including explosives, trace evidence, documents, 
chemistry, cryptography, DNA, facial reconstruction, fingerprints, firearms, and counterterrorism 
and forensic research. 
 
The Terrorist Explosives Device Analytical Center (“TEDAC”) is a key example. 
Formally established in 2004, TEDAC serves as the single interagency organization that receives, 
fully analyzes, and exploits all priority terrorist improvised explosive devices (“IEDs”). TEDAC 
coordinates the efforts of the entire government, including law enforcement, intelligence, and 
military entities, to gather and share intelligence about IEDs. These efforts help disarm and 
disrupt IEDs, link them to their makers, and prevent future attacks. For example, Laboratory 
Division personnel testified in New York in the successful prosecution of Muhanad Mahmoud Al 
Farekh after linking him to a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device prepared for an attack 
on a U.S. military base in Afghanistan. Although originally focused on devices from Iraq and 
Afghanistan, TEDAC now receives and analyzes devices from all over the world. 
 
Additionally, the Laboratory Division maintains a capability to provide forensic support 
for significant shooting investigations. The Laboratory Shooting Reconstruction Team provides 
support to FBI field offices by bringing together expertise from various Laboratory components 
to provide enhanced technical support to document complex shooting crime scenes. Services are 
scene- and situation-dependent and may include mapping of the shooting scene in two or three 
dimensions, scene documentation through photography, including aerial and oblique imagery, 
 
- 14 - 
360-degree photography and videography, trajectory reconstruction, and the analysis of gunshot 
residue and shot patterns. Significant investigations supported by this team include the shootings 
at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California; the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, 
Florida; the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas, Nevada; and the shooting of 12 
police officers during a protest against police shootings in Dallas, Texas. 
 
FBI Special Agents and Intelligence Analysts need the best technological tools available 
to be responsive to the advanced and evolving threats that face our nation. Enterprise information 
technology must be designed so that it provides information to operational employees rather than 
forcing employees to conform to the tools available. IT equipment must be reliable and 
accessible, thus decreasing the time between information collection and dissemination. 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
In closing, the work being done by the FBI is immeasurable; however, we cannot afford 
to be complacent.  We must seek out new technologies and solutions for the problems that exist 
today as well as those that are on the horizon.  We must build toward the future so that we are 
prepared to deal with the threats we will face at home and abroad and understand how those 
threats may be connected.   
 
Being expected to respond to a wide range of complex and ever-changing threats and 
crime problems is not new to the FBI.  Our success in meeting these challenges is, however, 
directly tied to the resources provided to the FBI.  The resources the Committee provides each 
year are critical for the FBI’s ability to address existing and emerging national security and 
criminal threats. 
 
Chairman Moran, Ranking Member Shaheen, and members of the Subcommittee, I would 
like to close by thanking you for this opportunity to discuss the FBI’s FY 2020 budget request 
and the key threats and challenges we are facing, both as a nation and as an organization.  We are 
grateful for the leadership that you and this subcommittee have provided to the FBI. Your 
willingness to invest in and support our workforce and our physical and technical infrastructure 
allow the men and women of the FBI to make a difference every day in communities large and 
small throughout our nation and around the world.  We thank you for that support. 
 
I look forward to answering any questions you may have.

STATEMENT OF R. ALEXANDER ACOSTA 
SECRETARY OF LABOR 
BEFORE THE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, EDUCATION, 
AND RELATED AGENCIES 
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS  
UNITED STATES SENATE 
May 2, 2019 
 
Chairman Blunt, Ranking Member Murray, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for 
the invitation to testify today.  I am pleased to appear before this Subcommittee and to represent 
President Trump and the hardworking men and women of the Department of Labor in reporting 
to you the progress of our work on behalf of all Americans, and to outline the Administration’s 
vision for the Department of Labor in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 and beyond.  
 
The President has put forth a responsible and well-reasoned budget for FY 2020 that reflects 
Administration priorities to support the American workforce.  Indeed, although the budget 
reflects a 10% decrease over FY 2019, the budget proposes greater investment in programs that 
work, eliminates programs that do not, and generally bolsters opportunities for working 
Americans through commonsense reforms.  The budget reflects a continued focus on 
comprehensive compliance assistance for those seeking help to comply with the law paired with 
vigorous, fair, and effective enforcement against those who violate the law and reflects our 
priority of putting American workers first, including ensuring that labor protections in trade 
agreements are enforced to prevent unfair competition.  As the information below shows, the 
Department of Labor has proven its ability to do more with less and to maximize the value of 
taxpayer dollars.  The budget balances fiscal responsibility, sound management, and focus on 
priorities. 
 
Overview 
The dedication, ingenuity, and innovation of our American workforce—the greatest workforce in 
the world—is unparalleled.  No one does it better than the hardworking men and women of our 
nation who farm, mine, make, build, transport, innovate, design, create, provide services, and 
engage with other Americans to make our lives healthier, safer, easier, and more productive.   
 
The President’s vision for America and the American workforce is straightforward:  to empower 
our economy to each day create jobs, more jobs, and even more jobs that are safe and family 
sustaining.  The Department is hard at work to keep Americans safe in the workplace; prevent 
discriminatory employment practices; safeguard retirement savings; increase employment 
opportunities for all Americans; level the playing field for working Americans through fair trade; 
collect, analyze, and disseminate essential economic information; promote private-sector union 
democracy and financial integrity; protect the interest of workers, and their families, who are 
1 
 
injured or become ill on the job; and ensure workers are paid what they are owed—in full and on 
time.  The Department is also working diligently to identify and eliminate regulations that 
unnecessarily eliminate jobs, hinder job creation, or impose costs that outweigh the benefits.   
 
The first two years of the Trump Administration were marked by remarkable growth for our 
economy, increased opportunity for the American workforce, and a renewed confidence 
exemplified by investment in our nation by job creators.  In part due to a commonsense approach 
to deregulation, I am pleased to report on just a few notable milestones: 
 
•  In FY 2018, according to the Office of Management and Budget, the U.S. Department 
of Labor’s deregulatory efforts totaled $3.28 billion in present value cost savings;   
•  Since January 2017, the American economy has created 5.1 million jobs, 3.2 million 
of those new jobs have been created since the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act;  
•  At the time this testimony was prepared, there were 7.1 million job openings, over 
one million more than the 6.2 million job seekers in the United States—American job 
creators are looking to hire;  
•  In 2018, average hourly earnings increased 3.3%, the largest increase in average 
hourly earnings since 2009; and importantly, wage growth for the lowest decile 
earners was at approximately 6.5%; 
•  Unemployment remains near its all-time low, and the increase in the labor force 
participation rate may indicate that Americans who were previously discouraged are 
rejoining the American workforce; and 
•  Even as employment substantially increased over the last two years, the numbers and 
rates of fatal injuries and nonfatal injuries and illnesses in the workplace declined in 
2017.  
 
While these statistics document the country’s success, during my travels throughout our nation 
over the past 21 months, it is clear that Main Street, not just Wall Street—from Indiana to 
California, Alaska to Florida—is deriving significant benefit from the economic growth.  More 
Americans are working today than ever before.  They are safer in the workplace.  They are 
earning more.  They have more opportunities for growth and advancement.  The future of the 
American workforce and the American economy look bright, and the Department looks forward 
to working with Congress to continue that growth and opportunity.  
 
Removing Roadblocks to Job Creation Through Regulatory Reform 
 
The Department administers and enforces more than 180 federal laws. These laws and the 
regulations that implement these laws cover more than 150 million workers and retirees, and 10 
million employers.  Consistent with the President’s priorities, the Department has worked to 
identify regulations that unnecessarily eliminate jobs, inhibit job creation, or impose costs that 
exceed benefits—and reform or eliminate them.   
 
Our approach to regulatory reform is simple, we adhere to two core principles: respect for the 
individual and respect for the rule of law.  The Department’s rulemaking is carried out in a 
deliberative manner guided by fidelity to the law.  Public participation in the rulemaking process 
2 
 
through notice and comment is vital.  It ensures all Americans have an opportunity to express 
their views before a rule is promulgated or changed. 
 
As mentioned above, the Office of Management and Budget estimates the regulatory impact of 
the Department’s FY 2018 regulatory reform efforts to reflect $3.28 billion in present value cost 
savings to the economy.  Put simply, this means the Department significantly decreased the 
compliance burden on Americans. 
 
In addition to these actions, we expanded access to affordable quality health care coverage 
options through Association Health Plans and rescinded the “Persuader Agreements” rule, which 
the American Bar Association and others believed inappropriately impinged on attorney-client 
confidentiality.   
 
Our deregulatory actions have continued this fiscal year with two recent final actions: one 
ensuring continued safety of crane operations while reducing paperwork burdens and the other 
removing the electronic collection of certain information about workplace injuries that raised 
worker privacy concerns and that is unnecessary for the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration’s (OSHA) electronic data collection requirements.  We have also issued 
deregulatory proposals in the last few weeks on overtime thresholds for Fair Labor Standards Act 
exemptions and what goes into the regular rate of pay for overtime, in addition to a proposal that 
addresses concerns about joint employment liability so that workers and their employers, 
especially small businesses like franchisees, have definitive guidance on their rights and 
responsibilities.  There are a number of other items that should be proposed shortly, including a 
proposal to ensure Americans and especially our military veterans have the broadest possible 
networks available when they need a doctor.   
 
Demanding Better Results Through Greater Accountability 
 
Accountability to the American taxpayer is a priority at the Department as we design new 
programs and evaluate existing ones.  We are focused on refining our efforts in a manner that 
respects principles of federalism, and best serves the American people.  Where Departmental 
efforts and programs are working, we are looking for ways to improve them and learn from 
them, where Departmental programs are not working, we are looking for ways to make them 
work or consider whether we should refocus our efforts elsewhere.  
 
One example I have often mentioned is the difficulty of gauging the success of federal programs 
when measuring inputs like dollars spent and program participants instead of outcomes like the 
career attainment rates of program graduates.  In FY 2018, the Department redesigned the way 
we measure the success and efficacy of the Job Corps program.  We announced that the Office of 
Job Corps would reform the Outcome Measurement System to focus on student performance and 
long-term outcomes over inputs such as dollars spent and outputs such as number of students 
served.  More specifically, the weights given to credential attainment have been reduced from 
about half, to 35% in Program Year (PY) 2018 and 20% in PY 2019.  New metrics that focus on 
initial placement, placement wage, and placement quality (job training match and 
apprenticeships, military, and full-time placements) are now an additional 30% of the report card 
3 
 
for both program years, and long-term placement and placement wage after six months and 12 
months account for the final 35% and 50% in PY 2018 and PY 2019.   
 
The Department also looks closely at opportunities to eliminate duplication to bring greater 
efficiency to our work and allocation of resources.  One such example is in the Mine Safety and 
Health Administration (MSHA).  During FY 2018, MSHA leadership examined the capacity and 
utilization of its field inspectors and discovered that there was significant overlap between the 
duties performed by metal/non-metal mine inspectors and coal mine inspectors, but different 
training and an imbalance in capacity relative to the actual utilization of inspectors.  As a result, 
MSHA leadership developed a plan to cross-train mine inspectors and reallocate resources.  The 
Department expects that this will result in significant savings to MSHA in FY 2019 with no 
impact on the health and safety of American miners.  
 
Finally, beginning in FY 2018 and continuing on into FY 2019, the Department is working to 
reduce the number of improper payments made through the state-run Unemployment Insurance 
(UI) Program.  The President’s FY 2020 budget request includes $126 million in additional 
resources to address improper payments made through the state-run UI program and improve 
interstate communication to reduce such payments.  The UI program is important to those 
Americans who need a helping hand during unemployment, and individuals that abuse the 
system may place added strain on these resources.  The Department is committed to reining in 
improper payments in the UI program.   
 
Returning Flexibility to the States  
 
The Department recognizes that the workforce development needs of Alaska, New York, 
Arizona, and Vermont differ widely.  The Department has made it a priority to work with States 
to help them customize their workforce programs.  An example is the exercise of the Secretary’s 
waiver authority under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) to grant 
flexibility where possible.  To date, the Department has granted 67 waivers to 28 states and 
territories to better tailor approaches to the needs and opportunities present in their states and 
communities. 
   
Providing States greater flexibility to administer programs efficiently and effectively is one way 
to better serve the individualized needs of Americans in various states and localities.  To that 
end, the President’s FY 2020 Budget proposes broader waiver authority for the core WIOA 
programs, allowing the Department to trust our nation’s governors with the responsibility of how 
best to operate their workforce systems.   
 
Bringing Clarity to Employers and Employees 
 
After meeting with many American job creators, one of the things most important to them that 
affects working Americans is stability and understanding how an agency interprets its statutes 
and regulations.  Clarity and consistency in agency interpretations allow the regulated public to 
comply with the law in a way that is not unduly burdensome or costly and ensure a level playing 
field.  
  
4 
 
One of the ways the Department can best do that is by answering specific questions from the 
regulated community and making those answers known publicly.  Accordingly, in June 2017, the 
Department’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) announced it was resuming its longstanding 
practice of issuing opinion letters.  Opinion letters are official, written opinions provided by the 
Department that address the application of statutes and regulations in specific circumstances 
presented by an employer, employee, or other entity.  The letters were previously a Department 
practice for more than 70 years and specifically allowed in statute, until the practice was 
discontinued in 2010.  
 
In FY 2018, WHD reissued 18 previously withdrawn opinion letters and has issued 14 new 
opinion letters.  These are now more readily available to the public on the WHD website via a 
searchable tool.  Among other areas, one of the more recent opinion letters addressed a 
longstanding question as to whether organ donors can avail themselves of the Family and 
Medical Leave Act.  Thanks to this opinion letter, it is now clear that they can.  Following on this 
success, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) also recently announced 
the institution of an opinion letter program.   
Expanding Access to High-Quality Health and Retirement Coverage for Americans 
 
On June 21, 2018, the Department published a final regulation expanding the ability of 
employers to participate in Association Health Plans (AHPs).1  The rule allows employers, 
including self-employed individuals and sole proprietors, to band together to offer group health 
coverage to their employees.  AHPs provide more affordable, high-quality health care coverage 
choices to consumers, while maintaining important consumer protections to safeguard against 
discrimination on the basis of the perceived health of a company’s workforce and individuals’ 
pre-existing conditions.  To date, more than 30 major organizations in 14 states have set up, or 
announced their intent to set up, AHPs to offer quality, affordable health care coverage options 
to their members’ employees.  
 
Building on this momentum, on August 31, 2018, President Trump signed Executive Order 
13847 on Strengthening Retirement Security in America.  Recognizing that all Americans 
deserve access to retirement savings opportunities, President Trump instructed the Department to 
examine opportunities to expand access to workplace retirement plan options and increase 
retirement security for all Americans.  
 
On October 23, 2018, the Department proposed a regulation clarifying the circumstances under 
which a group or association of employers, or a professional employer organization (PEO) can 
act as an employer and sponsor workplace retirement plans under the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act (ERISA).  If published as a final rule, this regulation has the potential to 
expand Americans’ access to affordable, quality retirement savings options.   
 
The Department is currently reviewing the public comments to the proposed regulation 
submitted before the comment period closed on December 24, 2018.   
                                                           
1 On March 28, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered an order that vacated 
certain provisions of the final rule.  We disagree with the Court’s ruling and are considering all available 
options to defend the legal viability of the provisions ruled upon by the Court.

Expanding Career Opportunities in America Through Reskilling, Upskilling, and 
Apprenticeships 
 
In FY 2018, President Trump established the National Council for the American Worker and 
charged it with developing a national strategy to prepare Americans for careers in high-demand 
industries.  As part of the work of the National Council for the American Worker, more than 200 
companies, associations, and labor organizations have pledged to provide enhanced career 
opportunities by expanding programs that educate, train, and reskill American workers from high 
school age to near retirement.  As of the time of this writing, these organizations have pledged to 
create 7,452,470 new opportunities for Americans. 
 
The Department is continuing to promote increased adoption of the apprenticeship model as a 
pathway to good, family-sustaining jobs for all Americans.  Since January 2017, nearly 500,000 
new apprentices have taken the first steps toward lifelong careers.   
 
In May 2018, the President’s Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion—comprised of 
governors, and leaders from companies, trade and industry groups, unions, educational 
institutions, workforce advocates, and nonprofit organizations—transmitted its final report to the 
President outlining its recommendations on how to best expand high-quality apprenticeship 
programs across industries.  
 
On July 27, 2018, the Department adopted the overwhelming majority of the Task Force’s 
recommendations through Training and Employment Notice 3-18 (TEN), providing a framework 
for industry recognized apprenticeships (IRAPs) to form alongside the more traditional 
registered apprenticeship program.  The TEN sets out, at a high level, the policies and procedures 
that certifiers will be expected to have in place to establish standards, establish certification 
intervals, evaluate and certify programs focused on outcomes and process, report results, and 
maintain records.   
   
Also last year, the Department launched the first-ever sector-based apprenticeship grant funding 
opportunity to invest $150 million to expand apprenticeships in those in-demand industry sectors 
most often filled by individuals on H-1B visas, such as information technology, health care, and 
advanced manufacturing.  This grant funding opportunity introduced an innovative approach:  a 
35% private-sector match requirement.  This brings the total investment to $202.5 million, $57.7 
million coming from the private sector.  As a result of this private sector match requirement, 
educators have a greater incentive to join with industry to ensure curricula address the needs of 
our ever-changing workplace, investing in the latest technologies and techniques, and providing 
more in-demand opportunities for Americans.   
 
In FY 2020, the Department’s budget includes $160 million to continue our expansion of 
apprenticeship programs, along with a proposal to increase H-1B fee revenues to fund additional 
apprenticeship activities.

Helping our Heroes and their Spouses Find Good, Family Sustaining Careers 
 
Through the Veterans’ Employment and Training Service (VETS), the Department helps 
America’s veterans succeed in civilian careers when they conclude their military service and 
protects their employment rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment 
Rights Act (USERRA).  The Department also helps eligible spouses of military service members 
navigate state licensing requirements and find meaningful employment, and advocates for the 
elimination or temporary suspension of occupational licensing requirements for military spouses.  
In 2018, thanks to a growing economy and VETS’ efforts, the overall veteran unemployment rate 
dropped to 3.5%, an 18-year low, and the lowest annual unemployment rate for veterans since 
2000.   
 
The Department is currently engaged with the Departments of Defense and Veterans’ Affairs to 
improve the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) as part of the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (NDAA).  NDAA directs these agencies to establish at least three 
pathways for transitioning service members, and the Department will alter the delivery of 
employment related workshops in FY 2020 to align with the new legislative requirements.  The 
Department will also enhance the quality of employment support services for transitioning 
service members, with a focus on improved outcomes.  Additionally, the Department is also 
developing components of TAP for military spouses as they transition from base to base or to 
civilian life when their active duty spouse leaves the military.  
 
Finally, the Department is committed to recognizing the many American job creators that 
employ veterans.  In 2018, the Department implemented the Honoring Investments in Recruiting 
and Employing American Military Veterans (HIRE Vets) Act program one year earlier than the 
statute contemplated through a demonstration program.  On November 8, 2018, the Department 
recognized 239 employers that employ and offer growth opportunities to our nation’s veterans.  
Collectively, these 239 employers hired more than 8,350 veterans. 
 
Bringing Americans with Disabilities into the Workforce 
 
The Department, through the Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP), provides 
Americans with disabilities with opportunities to join and succeed in the workforce.  ODEP 
develops policy recommendations and offers tools and technical assistance to American job 
creators so they can hire and retain employees with disabilities. 
 
In FY 2018, ODEP expanded its Stay at Work/Return to Work (SAW/RTW) initiative to support 
early intervention pilot projects and research initiatives, work with states to promote effective 
SAW/RTW policies, and address the need for early intervention for young people with 
disabilities to transition to gainful employment.  In September 2018, DOL awarded nearly $19 
million in grant awards to eight state workforce agencies for the Retaining Employment and 
Talent After Injury/Illness Network (RETAIN).  Jointly funded and developed by ODEP, the 
Department’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA), and the Social Security 
Administration (SSA), the primary goal of RETAIN demonstration projects is to help Americans 
who are injured or ill remain in or return to the workforce, through early coordination of health 
care services and employment-related supports and services.   
7 
 
ODEP also connects employers and skilled workers with disabilities through its technical 
assistance centers, such as the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) and the Employer Assistance 
and Resource Network on Disability Inclusion (EARN), and partnerships such as the Partnership 
on Employment and Accessible Technology (PEAT) which provides a free tool for employers to 
optimize online job applications and outreach efforts.    
 
In FY 2018, JAN provided technical assistance to more than 42,000 employers, individuals with 
disabilities, and service providers, and conducted more than 107 trainings.  EARN provided 
technical assistance to more than 5,000 employers and ODEP’s Public Service Announcements 
supporting its efforts aired approximately 32,000 times on more than 650 television stations 
nationwide. 
 
Helping Americans Reenter the Workforce After Incarceration 
 
When Americans who commit crimes have paid their debt to society and leave prison, it is 
important to find ways to reintroduce those individuals into society and the workforce.  Simply 
put, individuals that have made mistakes in life and paid their debts to society deserve the 
opportunity to find good, safe, family sustaining careers and become contributing members of 
society.  Long-term success at lowering recidivism rates requires that we offer Americans a 
second chance to pursue paths to opportunity.  These concepts were part of the bipartisan First 
Step Act passed late last year.   
 
In FY 2018, to address this important issue, the Department awarded Reentry Projects grants to 
43 nonprofits and local and state governments focusing on two major groups: young adults (ages 
18 to 24) who have been involved in the juvenile or adult justice system and adults (ages 25 and 
older) formerly incarcerated in the adult criminal justice system. These grants offer communities 
the chance to deploy evidence-based, comprehensive strategies to facilitate the reintegration of 
ex-offenders into the workforce.  In FY 2019, the Department will award an additional $83 
million in Reentry Projects grants.  
 
The Department is also engaging with the Bureau of Prisons to develop apprenticeship programs.  
These programs seek to offer skills instruction and develop credentials that address the 
geographical issue associated with prison-based programs—federal inmates are often 
incarcerated in one state, transferred, and released in another.  As part of this new apprenticeship 
program, education and training in more than 120 skilled trades will be offered. 
 
Also, to address the stigma that employers associate with formerly incarcerated individuals, the 
Department is expanding its Federal Bonding Program which provides employers with access to 
$5,000‐$25,000 of fidelity bond coverage for the first six months of employment for formerly 
incarcerated individuals. 
 
Protecting Working Americans by Confronting Visa Fraud and Abuse 
Companies that commit visa fraud, and abuse the temporary worker system hurt working 
Americans and American job creators that play by the rules.  These bad actors cut costs by not 
providing legally required wages and working conditions and, in some instances, foreign 
workers’ lives are at stake.  
8 
 
 
In June 2017, I directed the Department to confront non-immigrant visa program fraud and 
abuse, including making criminal referrals to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG).  The 
Department also made changes to the H-1B application forms to ensure greater transparency and 
better protect American workers from employers seeking to misuse the program. 
 
In FY 2018, the Department concluded 649 non-immigrant visa program cases and found 
violations in 553 of those cases.  In FY 2018, the Department issued 37 debarments in the H-2A, 
H-2B, and PERM visa programs—precluding those employers from obtaining visas or doing 
work with the Department—a 61% increase over FY 2017.  In total, Department has recovered 
almost $11.6 million in back wages on behalf of 6,061 non-immigrant visa employees in FY 
2018 and issued almost $4.2 million in civil money penalties—under 27% of dollars recovered.  
By way of comparison, in FY 2016, the Department concluded only 526 non-immigrant visa 
cases, and recovered only $7.8 million in back wages for 5,161 employees.  At the same time, 
the Department assessed approximately $4.8 million in civil money penalties—nearly 38% of 
dollars recovered.   
 
Leveling the Playing Field for Working Americans Through Fair Trade 
 
U.S. labor laws guarantee that working Americans be paid a minimum wage and overtime, that 
workplaces abide by health and safety standards, and restrict child labor.  U.S. free trade 
agreements and preference programs require our trade partners to adopt, maintain, and 
effectively enforce labor laws addressing similar areas of protection.  When trading partners fall 
short of their labor standards responsibilities under trade agreements, they create an uneven 
playing field that can hurt working Americans.  The Budget strategically focuses efforts to make 
U.S. trade agreements fair for U.S. workers by monitoring and enforcing the labor provisions of 
free trade agreements and trade preference programs, combatting the reprehensible use of child 
labor and forced labor abroad, and providing technical assistance to countries seeking to improve 
labor standards. 
 
In addition to the Department’s direct work on international labor issues, the Department also 
provides detailed research products and tools that help foreign governments and employers 
improve compliance with international child labor and forced labor standards.  On September 20, 
2018, the Department released its 17th annual child labor report, Findings on the Worst Forms of 
Child Labor, representing the most comprehensive research product to date on the state of child 
labor in 132 countries worldwide.  Simultaneously, the Department released an updated version 
of its Comply Chain app, which is designed to help businesses identify and root out abusive child 
labor and forced labor from global supply chains.  Comply Chain is now also available in 
Spanish and French. 
 
Women’s Bureau 
The Department’s Women’s Bureau assists in the development of policies and initiatives that 
promote the interests of the more than 74 million women in the United States labor force.  
Women’s Bureau collaborates with Department program agencies and other federal partners to 
provide policy guidance, including on initiatives such as apprenticeships, military spouses, and 
occupational licensing, to better support the needs of women and their families. 
9 
 
   
Women’s Bureau is holding listening sessions across the country with military spouses in an 
effort to design a TAP specific to military spouses, 92% of whom are women.  The Department 
leveraged its work with military spouses to aid efforts to redesign the workforce reentry 
components of TAP, focusing on assisting military spouses.   
 
Women’s Bureau is also holding nationwide events and listening sessions—several of which 
were attended by Advisor to the President Ivanka Trump—to discuss the challenges, best 
practices, and potential solutions to help all working families access affordable, quality child 
care.  
 
Finally, the Department is conducting data analysis to better understand the impact of the opioid 
crisis on women in the labor force.  This includes identifying and correcting the lack of 
information related to the opioid epidemic’s effect on women in the labor force, relative to the 
existing research on its impact on men in the labor force.  Building on this effort, the Department 
piloted a reemployment program grant in Maryland for women impacted by the opioid epidemic.   
 
The Budget focuses the Bureau’s work on high priority areas like childcare, military spouses, 
entrepreneurship, and paid leave while eliminating unnecessary regional offices and eliminating 
grants.  
A Strategy of Vigorous Enforcement Coupled With Compliance Assistance  
 
The vast majority of employers are responsible actors, fully committed to following worker 
protection laws and to providing good, safe jobs for their employees.  There are, however, those 
that fail to comply with their legal obligations.  In those instances, the Department enforces our 
nation’s laws that protect working Americans—and does so vigorously.  By way of example, in 
FY 2018 the WHD’s work resulted in a record $304 million in back wages recovered for more 
than 265,000 workers across America.  Fully enforcing the law levels the playing field for the 
majority of American job creators who play by the rules and supports the Nation’s most 
important asset – working Americans.   
 
As a parallel to enforcement, there is significant value in compliance assistance programs that 
help working Americans and American job creators understand their rights and responsibilities 
under the law.  Cooperation between the private sector and government can yield strong results 
at a quicker pace and lower cost than adversarial enforcement actions.  Parties acting in good 
faith should have the help of the government to do so and should not be penalized for proactively 
requesting assistance.  
 
In August 2018, the Department launched the Office of Compliance Initiatives (OCI) to bring 
together agencies’ compliance assistance efforts into a single, concerted program.  The office, 
led by a career employee team, will help working Americans and American job creators 
understand their rights and responsibilities under the law and has launched the websites 
employer.gov and worker.gov to provide plain language guidance.   
 
The Department’s FY 2020 budget request includes additional resources for this office, as well 
as funding increases for every worker protection agency.  
10 
 
Employee Benefits Security Administration 
 
EBSA helps ensure the security of the retirement, health, and other workplace related benefits of 
almost all American workers who have private-sector employer-sponsored plans.  EBSA’s 
enforcement authority extends to an estimated 694,000 private retirement plans, 2.2 million 
health plans, and similar numbers of other welfare benefit plans which together hold $9.5 trillion 
in assets.  These plans provide critical benefits to America’s workers, retirees, and their families.   
 
In safeguarding and clearly delineating fiduciaries’ responsibilities on behalf of participants, on 
April 23, 2018, EBSA issued a Field Assistance Bulletin (FAB) laying out the Department’s 
position that fiduciaries may not sacrifice investment returns, or assume greater risk, in order to 
promote collateral social goals, and must exercise care before incurring significant expenses to 
fund advocacy in the proxy voting space.   
 
In FY 2018, EBSA recovered more than $1.16 billion in enforcement actions—a 70% increase 
over FY 2017—and EBSA’s criminal program resulted in 142 indictments.  A large portion of 
this increase is attributable to EBSA’s Terminated Vested Participants Program, which 
recovered over $807 million in benefit payments for participants and beneficiaries in defined 
benefit plans.  During the same time period, EBSA’s Benefits Advisors recovered an additional 
$443.2 million on behalf of participants and beneficiaries through informal dispute resolution, 
assisting 170,909 Americans.   
The President’s FY 2020 budget request for EBSA stands at $193.5 million, a nearly seven 
percent increase from the FY 2019 revised enacted budget, and includes additional enforcement 
resources of $10.0 million and 45 FTE that will focus on investigating self-insured AHPs and 
self-insured Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements.  
 
Mine Safety and Health Administration 
 
MSHA’s enforcement strategy is grounded in its mandate to inspect all active mines in the 
United States and its territories regularly.  MSHA’s enforcement mandate is essential to protect 
miners and advance a culture of safety and health in the mining industry.   
 
In support of its mission, MSHA also provides grants and compliance assistance to the mining 
community.  In FY 2018, MSHA’s annual Training Resources Applied to Mining (TRAM) 
conference drew more than 300 mining stakeholders to learn about training techniques, new 
technology, and best practices in mining.  The MSHA Academy provided 443 course days of 
compliance assistance training to the mining community.  Educational Field and Small Mine 
Services, with support from Educational Policy Development personnel, provided 69,186 hours 
of additional compliance assistance in the field.   
 
In FY 2018, MSHA fulfilled its statutory mandate to inspect all underground mines four times 
per year and all surface mines twice per year which, combined with non-mandatory inspections, 
helped foster a more safe mining industry.  Notably, the mining industry overall experienced the 
lowest number of fatalities in FY 2018.  The Department remains focused on reducing the 
11 
 
numbers of mining injuries and fatalities even more, because our goal must be zero mining 
deaths.  
The President’s FY 2020 Budget request for MSHA stands at $376 million, an increase over the 
FY 2019 revised enacted budget, and proposes a new enforcement structure that combines the 
Coal Mine Safety and Health and Metal/Non-Metal Safety and Health budget activities. This 
consolidated budget activity will provide the flexibility to address industry changes and 
maximize the efficient use of MSHA’s resources. 
 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
 
OSHA helps ensure that employers provide safe and healthful working conditions for working 
men and women by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, 
education, and assistance. OSHA also administers the whistleblower provisions of more than 20 
whistleblower statutes.  Compliance assistance and enforcement—driven by workplace 
inspections and investigations—play a vital role in OSHA’s efforts to reduce workplace injuries, 
illnesses, and fatalities.   
 
In FY 2018, and in FY 2017, OSHA conducted more than 32,000 inspections each year, 
exceeding the FY 2016 number. These results are impressive particularly given that OSHA 
dedicated substantial resources in FY 2018 to hiring and training new inspectors.  In August 
2017, OSHA was provided blanket approval to hire needed inspectors to carry out its important 
work.  The result was the hiring of 76 new inspectors in FY 2018.  The timeframe for new 
inspectors that join the Department to be prepared to conduct inspections can vary between one 
to three years depending on their prior experience and complexity of the inspections they may 
carry out.   During this time, these new hires do not generally conduct independent inspections. 
OSHA has been hard at work to onboard and train new inspectors and expects to have a 
significant increase in inspectors in FY 2019.   
 
In FY 2018, in addition, OSHA personnel made 26,362 compliance assistance visits covering 
more than 970,000 workers and ensuring that 135,021 hazards were identified/corrected.  The 
estimated savings in injuries and costs prevented by this program exceed $1.3 billion.   
 
Late in 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the injury and fatality data for calendar 
year 2017.  Even as employment substantially increased and less-experienced workers were 
onboarded, the numbers and rates of fatal injuries and nonfatal injuries and illnesses in the 
workplace declined.  With 43 fewer workplace fatalities in 2017, reversing a three year upward 
trend, the fatality rate fell to 3.5 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers.  The incidence rate 
for private industry nonfatal cases fell to 2.8 per 100 full-time equivalent workers after 
employers reported 45,800 fewer cases.  This overall decrease occurred against a backdrop of a 
substantial increase in fatalities due to unintentional overdose from nonmedical use of drugs or 
alcohol, which increased from 217 to 272 workplace fatalities nationwide. 
The Department is committed to fostering an environment that promotes disclosure of dangerous 
work conditions and protects whistleblowers.  OSHA’s Whistleblower Program prevents 
retaliation against workers that report injuries, safety concerns, or engage in other protected 
12 
 
activity.  In FY 2018, OSHA implemented internal measures, such as expedited case processing 
and streamlined case documentation requirements, to increase the efficiency of the 
Whistleblower Protection Program.  FY 2018 saw 9,387 new complaints under the program, a 
9% increase over FY 2017, and processed 9,308 complaints, an 8.4% increase over FY 2017.   
 
The President’s FY 2020 budget request for OSHA stands at $557.5 million, a slight increase 
over the FY 2019 revised enacted budget, and proposes additional funding for staff, including 30 
additional Compliance Safety and Health Officers and five additional whistleblower 
investigators.  
 
Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs  
 
OFCCP is tasked with ensuring that Federal contractors and subcontractors comply with their 
equal employment opportunity obligations.   
 
OFCCP supports compliance through assistance tools, resources, and incentives.  Indeed, in FY 
2018, OFCCP held 346 events to inform and educate the regulated community and handled 
2,797 help desk requests via telephone calls and email.  Also in FY 2018, OFCCP issued its 
“Town Hall Action Plan” and “What Contractors Can Expect” to engage with the regulated 
community and demystify OFCCP’s work.  Specifically, the agency sought to develop the broad 
understanding that contractors and subcontractors seeking OFCCP’s assistance with satisfying 
their nondiscrimination and equal employment opportunity obligations can expect clear, 
accurate, and professional interactions with OFCCP’s staff.  
 
In FY 2018, the OFCCP conducted 812 compliance evaluations, entered into 168 conciliation 
agreements, and obtained over $16 million in monetary remedies for more than 12,000 affected 
employees and applicants.    
The President’s FY 2020 budget proposal for OFCCP stands at $103.6 million, a slight increase 
from the FY 2019 revised enacted budget, and includes funding for IT modernization efforts 
which is largely offset by gains obtained through operational efficiencies in OFCCP.  
 
Office of Labor Management Standards 
 
The Office of Labor Management Standards (OLMS) administers and enforces most of the 
provisions of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA).  The LMRDA 
promotes union democracy and financial integrity in private sector labor unions, and 
transparency for labor unions and their officials, employers, labor relations consultants, and 
surety companies through reporting and disclosure requirements.  In FY 2018, OLMS conducted 
16,968 participant hours of compliance assistance instruction—the highest since FY 2012. 
 
The Department is also currently working on a new transparency regulatory proposal for union 
trust accounts so that union members can see where their money is going when it becomes part 
of a covered trust.   
 
13 
 
In FY 2018, OLMS investigated 128 union elections after complaints of violations, supervised 28 
rerun elections due to election violations, and conducted 223 criminal investigations which 
resulted in 73 convictions.  
The President’s FY 2020 budget for OLMS stands at $49.1 million, a 15.8% increase over the 
FY 2019 revised enacted budget, and includes a proposed increase of $4.2 million in staffing 
increases to support enforcement programs that ensure union transparency and financial 
integrity, both of which inure to the benefit of the hardworking men and women that make up the 
membership of unions.  
 
Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs  
 
The Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP) administers four major disability 
compensation programs covering more than two million Federal employees, and a significant 
number of private sector workers, which provide wage replacement benefits, medical treatment, 
vocational rehabilitation, and other benefits to certain working Americans, or their dependents, 
who experience work-related injuries or occupational disease.  
 
Among those programs, OWCP oversees prescription benefits for injured federal workers and is 
taking aggressive measures to control fraud.  OWCP implemented measures in FY 2018 to target 
and intercept abusive billing patterns, resulting in a $5 million per month average savings in 
overall pharmaceutical spending.2  These savings are in addition to the $19 million per month 
average savings in overall pharmaceutical spending realized in FY 2017 from addressing 
compounded drugs.3 
 
In 2017, the President rightfully declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency.  Opioids 
are affecting how job creators hire, how job holders work, and how job seekers find family-
sustaining jobs.  This crisis is far-reaching and touches far too many Americans.  The 
Department is doing its part to combat the opioids crisis.  OWCP has taken aggressive steps to 
prevent the over-prescribing of opioids for the approximately 200,000 federal employees or 
dependent beneficiaries each year who receive workers compensation benefits.  Specifically, 
OWCP issued prescription guidelines for medical providers, and will monitor billing patterns 
and multi-party networks of interest using predictive analytics and risk metrics.   
 
OWCP is also updating its computer resources and acquiring a Pharmacy Benefit Manager to 
assist in these efforts.  Since January 2017, OWCP has seen a significant drop in the number of 
claimants prescribed high-dose opioids, with a 59% drop in claimants prescribed a morphine-
equivalent dose (MED) of 500 or more, and a 31% drop in claimants prescribed an MED of 90 
or more as of the end of February 2019.  Additionally, when comparing 20 months of data – 
January 2017 to August 2018 and the same time period in 2015 to 2016 – there was a 24% drop 
in new opioid prescriptions and a 51% decline in new opioid prescriptions lasting more than 30 
days.   
                                                           
2 Comparing the seven months following implementation of measures in 2018 (June 2018 – December 
2018) to the months prior in fiscal year 2018 (October 2017 – May 2018). 
3 Comparing the first six months of 2016 to the fiscal year 2017 months after the primary compounded 
drug control was implemented (November 2016 – September 2017). 
14 
 
The Department is resolute in its commitment to ensuring that injured federal employees access 
opioids only with adequate medical supervision.  OWCP now requires that the prescribing 
physician complete a medical evaluation and attest to the medical necessity of continued opioid 
treatment for all new opioid prescriptions that extend beyond an initial period of time, requires 
prior authorization and a letter of medical necessity for all new opioid prescriptions that extend 
beyond an initial grace period, and has imposed fill and re-fill prescription limits.  
 
OWCP has also worked closely with the OIG to eliminate Federal Employees’ Compensation 
Act (FECA) fraud.  In cooperation with the OIG, OWCP created documents that facilitate 
interagency investigation and prosecution efforts by providing guidance to the government-wide 
OIG community on how to request FECA data and submit reports of investigation that implicate 
waste, fraud, and abuse.  In FY 2018, OWCP submitted 62 medical provider referrals to the 
OIG—covering more than 100 individual providers—for possible fraudulent medical billing.  
These referrals were due in large part to the establishment of OWCP’s Program Integrity Unit 
housed in the Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation.  
 
The President’s FY 2020 request for OWCP’s discretionary salaries and expenses amount stands 
at $117.8 million, a slight increase over the FY 2019 revised enacted budget.  
 
Wage and Hour Division 
 
WHD is tasked with ensuring compliance with, and enforcement of, many of the nation’s 
fundamental Federal labor laws, including minimum wage, overtime, and child labor laws.  To 
accomplish its mission, WHD employs enforcement and compliance assistance strategies, along 
with evidence-based and data-driven approaches to allocate resources in a manner that 
maximizes its impact on behalf of workers in the United States.   
 
FY 2018 also saw record enforcement numbers from WHD resulting in the recovery of more 
than $304 million in back wages for more than 265,000 workers across America.  Enforcement is 
a critical part of WHD’s overall strategy and is employed rigorously when compliance 
assistance, alone, is not enough.  WHD’s enforcement efforts are tailored to safeguard workers’ 
rights and obtain due compensation for violations of the law.   
 
In FY 2018, WHD conducted a record 3,643 outreach events and presentations, providing 
valuable information and compliance assistance to participants across the United States.  As part 
of this effort, WHD employs Community Outreach and Resource Planning Specialists (CORPS) 
in nearly all district offices nationwide.  The CORPS have been successful in establishing 
partnerships with industry associations and employers to offer compliance assistance and educate 
stakeholders on labor standards. 
 
In FY 2018, WHD recovered more than $304 million in back wages for more than 265,000 
working Americans and other workers—more than any other year in the agency’s history, and 
an average of $1,147 per person.   
 
15 
 
The President’s FY 2020 budget request for WHD stands at $232.6 million, a slight increase 
over the FY 2019 revised enacted budget, and proposes additional funding for staff to modernize 
compliance assistance efforts. 
Helping Americans Get Back to Work After Natural Disasters 
 
This fiscal year, the states of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and territories of 
Northern Mariana Islands endured an active and destructive hurricane season. At the same time, 
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands continued their recovery from last year’s storms.  For a 
second year in a row, California suffered destructive wildfires.  
  
The Department of Labor worked with federal, state, and local agencies to provide much-needed 
support to those affected.  The Department: 
 
•  provided more than $100 million in grants to help affected states and territories assess  
their workforce needs;  
•  sent personnel and donated equipment to assist in recovery efforts; and 
•  oversaw Disaster Unemployment Assistance aid to those unemployed as a result of 
the hurricanes. 
 
In addition to funding and direct support, the Department also worked to reduce barriers to 
rebuilding and aid efforts, and reduce the burdens on survivors by providing much-needed 
regulatory flexibility.  The Department: 
 
•  temporarily waived certain retirement plan and group health plan requirements and 
deadlines;  
•  temporarily suspended select federal contractor requirements, allowing businesses 
involved in hurricane relief the ability to prioritize recovery efforts;  
•  temporarily eased reporting and other regulatory burdens on labor organizations, 
labor relations consultants, and employers affected by the hurricanes; and 
•  provided other regulatory flexibility requested by individual states. 
 
The Department continues to support the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with 
hurricane and wild fire recovery efforts.  In the wake of the 2017 and 2018 hurricanes, 
Department staff conducted more than 2,229 outreach activities, providing critical information 
and compliance assistance to more than 14,000 workers in affected areas; more than 2,276 safety 
and health interventions reaching more than 11,494 workers, of which more than 6,391 
individuals were removed from hazards; and served more than 24,907 working Americans.  The 
Department is also conducting investigations to ensure workers employed in recovery efforts are 
receiving the wages to which they are legally entitled and ensure a level playing field for law-
abiding businesses. 
 
The hardworking men and women of the Department also donated 13,659 hours, or more than 
1,707 days, and more than $47,000 in gift cards to their colleagues who suffered significant 
property damage or loss as a result; and more than 500 DOL employees volunteered to travel to 
affected areas to support the recovery efforts.  
16 
 
Conclusion 
 
In closing, I hope my statement today makes clear the depth and breadth of the Department’s 
accomplishments this past year.  The Department is hard at work supporting Americans’ efforts 
to find, and excel in good, safe, family-sustaining jobs.  
 
We look forward to working with Congress on these important goals.

KEVIN K. MCALEENAN 
 
ACTING SECRETARY 
 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
 
REGARDING A HEARING ON 
 
“THE FY 2020 DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY BUDGET” 
 
BEFORE THE 
 
UNITED STATES SENATE 
 
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS  
 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY 
 
May 2, 2019  
Washington, D.C. 
 
   
Chairman Capito, Ranking Member Tester, and distinguished Members of the 
Subcommittee: 
 
It is a privilege to appear before you today to discuss the Department of Homeland Security’s 
(DHS) essential missions and to present the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget for the 
Department. 
 
DHS is comprised of 14 major components employing more than 240,000 men and women 
dedicated to the mission of ensuring the safety and security of our great nation.  I want to start 
by thanking the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security for their 
extraordinary service to our nation.  The men and women of DHS are exceptional and 
dedicated professionals who are on watch 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Their mission is to 
protect Americans from threats by land, sea, air, and in cyberspace, while also promoting our 
nation’s economic prosperity.  They work tirelessly to strengthen the safety and security of our 
nation from persistent and emerging dangers, including terrorists, transnational criminal 
organizations, rogue nation-states, and natural disasters. 
 
Although our mission statement is simple, the mission itself is extremely complex.  The 
Department’s reach is global; spanning more than 7,450 miles of U.S. border and 95,000 miles 
of coastline to 4.5 million square miles of U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and regions of 
the high seas known for smuggling operations.  Our reach continues into the cyber world where 
nefarious actors attack U.S. financial, technological, and electoral interests.  The Department is 
also responsible for the security of our traveling public and movement of goods through 
international trade.  It is our dedicated personnel who not only achieve DHS’s global reach, 
they also create efficient and effective operations 24 hours a day.  I am proud to lead and 
represent the dedicated men and women of DHS as they are America’s frontline defense.  
 
The FY 2020 President’s Budget for DHS requests $51.7 billion in net discretionary funding and 
an additional $19.4 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) supporting response to and 
recovery from major disasters.  The President’s Budget proposes to strengthen the security of our 
nation through enhanced border security, immigration enforcement, cyber security, 
transportation security, resilience to disasters, and senior leadership protection. 
 
Highlighting some of the Department’s accomplishments provides a mere glimpse of the threats 
to our nation’s security.  At the completion of FY 2018, Customs and Border Protection 
encountered more than 683,000 illegal migrants and inadmissibles, Homeland Security 
Investigations made more than 34,000 criminal arrests, of which 4,300 were gang-related; and 
law enforcement agents and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) seized more than one million 
pounds of illegal drugs.  Keeping our traveling public safe is another vitally important job for 
DHS.   For example, in FY 2018 the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened 
more than 800 million aviation passengers while preventing almost 4,200 firearms from being 
carried onto aircraft.   
 
In 2018, the United States endured significant natural disasters such as Hurricanes Michael and 
Florence and the deadliest wildfires in California’s modern history including the one that 
obliterated the town of Paradise.  Preserving life and reclamation efforts, FEMA obligated more 
2 
 
than $9.2 billion in Public Assistance, including funding to clear debris, rebuild roads, schools, 
libraries, and other public facilities, and provided more than $1 billion in Individual Assistance 
to survivors.  These are just a few examples of how our men and women deliver on a daily basis 
for the American people.     
 
Security of our Nation’s borders remains a primary focus of the Administration and the 
Department, and doing more with less is an unacceptable method for achieving mission goals.  
This situation on the border with unprecedented numbers of families and children represents an 
acute and worsening crisis. CBP encountered nearly 40,000 children in the month of April alone. 
Our immigration system is not equipped to accommodate the significant change in migration 
patterns from one largely composed of single adults from Mexico to one comprised mainly of 
families and unaccompanied children from non-contiguous countries.  Previous patterns—
somewhat predictable in composition and predicated on seasonal variations—are no longer the 
norm. Unlawful migration through the U.S. southern border has increased by over 60 percent 
from the previous year.  In addition, the speed with which illegal migrants are transiting through 
Mexico to reach our southern border is frustrating our best efforts to respond quickly and keep 
pace with the overwhelming numbers of migrants arriving at the southern border.  
 
The migration flow and the resulting humanitarian crisis is now even more dire and is rapidly 
overwhelming the ability of the Federal Government to respond.  In February, U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP) encountered over 76,000 illegal border crossers and inadmissible 
aliens, and in March that number exceeded 100,000—the highest monthly level in more than a 
decade.  Despite heroic efforts, the Nation’s ability to humanely and compassionately care for 
vulnerable populations and expeditiously process and detain those who should not be admitted is 
being stressed to the breaking point.  Unaccompanied children and families are crowded into 
U.S. Border Patrol stations that were never intended as long-term shelters.  U.S. Border Patrol 
personnel no longer have the ability to identify, process, and transport all of those apprehended 
at the border to safe and secure facilities designed to house them, but have instead been 
increasingly pressed into service to provide critical humanitarian, medical support, and 
transportation services for this uniquely vulnerable population.  
 
The Southwest Border still lacks a permanent wall and persistent domain awareness in 
vulnerable areas.  The FY 2020 Budget requests $8.6 billion in DHS and DOD funding for the 
construction of approximately 300 miles of new border wall system.  A border wall is a proven 
deterrent that enhances U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) ability to apprehend those 
entering our Nation illegally; it is foundational to any strategy of achieving operational control of 
the Southwest Border.   
 
Domain awareness complements a permanent wall through actionable intelligence.  The current 
crisis at the border demands persistent awareness to allow our agents to respond rapidly and 
effectively to any incursion, and achieving this level of awareness requires a commitment to the 
procurement and sustainment of technology.  The President’s Budget requests upgrades to 
sensors such as the Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) and associated command and 
control (C2) systems, continued procurement of the Multi-Role Enforcement Aircraft, and UH-
60 Blackhawk Helicopter upgrades.  Through continued domain awareness and border wall 
3 
 
construction, DHS increases its chances of mission success of ensuring that our Nation’s 
Southwest Border and our citizens are secure.   
 
Border security in itself is not enough.  We must continue to address those who already have 
entered our country illegally.  We must further immigration enforcement.  The U.S. Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) average daily population (ADP) forecasting model reinforces 
a budget increase to 54,000 beds.  This increase allows ICE to handle continued migration flows, 
enhance enforcement activity within our borders, and remove those who have entered illegally 
and are presenting a danger to our communities.  The President’s Budget maintains safe and 
secure facilities for 2,500 families.  
 
For lower-risk apprehended aliens, funding is requested to expand the Alternatives to Detention 
(ATD) program to 120,000 daily participants.  The ATD program supervises certain individuals 
using a combination of personal visits and monitoring technology, allowing individuals to 
remain in their communities while their cases are processed.  Additionally, the Transportation 
and Removal Program requires additional resources in FY 2020 to ensure the safe and secure 
transportation of aliens who are either subject to Final Orders of Removal or require transfer 
within the United States.   
 
Investment in our most critical resource, human capital, remains a high priority for me.  Funding 
is included in the request for 750 additional Border Patrol Agents, 273 CBP Officers, and more 
than 1,660 ICE frontline and support personnel.  Retaining our personnel is a priority, and the 
Department continues to look for affordable and effective retention measures, especially for our 
Border Patrol Agents.   
 
The FY 2020 Budget also requests increased resources for international trade and travel 
requirements.  In 2018, the President signed the National Security Presidential Memorandum 
establishing the National Vetting Center (NVC).  The NVC utilizes law enforcement and 
classified data to better identify potential threats to the homeland.  It brings together different 
streams of information and intelligence into a single process for adjudicating applications for 
travel to the U.S. Through this technology, CBP can now receive near-real time responses from 
Intelligence Community partners for more than 35,000 ESTA applications each day.  
 
Our nation’s defense continues beyond the physical borders and into the high seas.  It is the 
USCG that stands as our phalanx to those who threaten our maritime interests.  Since 1790, the 
USCG has performed its vital mission of saving those in peril while promoting our national 
security and economic prosperity in a complex and evolving maritime environment.  The FY 
2020 Budget is committed to maintaining USCG readiness levels and continued modernization 
with new and more capable assets.  The President’s Budget includes more than $1.1 billion for 
recapitalization of Coast Guard resources including, but not limited to, the genesis of the third 
Offshore Patrol Cutter, procurement of two Fast Response Cutters, funding to continue efforts 
toward constructing the nation’s first Polar Security Cutter, and aircraft sensor modernization.  
Additionally, this budget includes funding for a 3.1 percent pay raise for our military personnel. 
 
Continuing efforts to improve public transportation resiliency, DHS is steadfast in addressing 
areas of vulnerability.  Although heavily fortified, the public air-travel system must evolve with 
4 
 
changing threats.  TSA is an intelligence-driven, national security organization employing risk-
based security principles to actively combat evolving threats to our critical transportation 
infrastructure.  
 
TSA continues to experience airline passenger volume growth at airport checkpoints nationwide. 
Additional Transportation Security Officers (TSO) are needed to uphold security effectiveness 
and compliance, keep screening times on pace with volume growth, and stay ahead of increasing 
costs and security demands at airports nationwide.  The $3.3 billion requested for the Screening 
Workforce adds 1,028 screener positions for a total of more than 46,600 TSOs, the highest level 
in history.  The request proposes a $1.00 increase in the 9/11 passenger security fee in order to 
cover a greater share of the costs of aviation security.  This is a minimal fee increase and should 
be considered seriously by Congress.  The budget also funds an additional 320 computed 
tomography (CT) units.  The CT units are used in airport screening lanes to effectively detect 
smaller and more artfully concealed threats within carry-on bags.  
 
DHS continues to improve its collective efforts in cybersecurity with the recent creation of the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).  In passing the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018, Congress recognized that the role played by CISA 
has never been more important.  Requiring collaboration between both government and private-
sector organizations, CISA is charged with protecting the nation’s critical infrastructure from 
physical and cyber threats.  Through this mission, DHS is focused on improving our digital 
defense as cybersecurity threats continue to grow in scope and severity. 
 
To assess evolving cybersecurity risks and protect Federal Government information systems and 
critical infrastructure, the FY 2020 President’s Budget includes more than $1.3 billion for 
Federal Network Protection (FNP) and Infrastructure Security.  Included in FNP are the 
Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation, the National Cybersecurity Protection System – known 
operationally as EINSTEIN-and Federal Network Resilience.  These systems in conjunction with 
the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) provide the 
technological foundation to secure and defend the Federal Government’s civilian information 
technology infrastructure against advanced cyber threats.     
 
The resiliency mission is carried even further through the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA).  Its mission reduces loss of life and property and protects the nation from all 
hazards by leading and supporting the nation in a risk-based, comprehensive emergency 
management system.  Before, during, and after disasters, FEMA focuses on supporting and 
empowering disaster survivors by increasing their capacity to take effective and practical steps to 
help themselves, their families, and their communities.  The better prepared that citizens are to 
assist themselves and others in times of need, the stronger our nation will be in the event of 
future emergencies. 
 
Therefore, the FY 2020 President’s Budget requests increased funding for programs that support 
FEMA’s three primary strategic goals of:  building a culture of preparedness, increasing 
catastrophic disaster readiness, and reducing FEMA complexity.  Requested funds support the 
implementation of FEMA Integration Teams (FIT) who develop relationships with state 
emergency management offices, enhancing the coordinated state and Federal response.  The 
5 
 
budget also includes funding for the FY 2020 Disaster Relief Fund in support of disaster 
declarations for hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and for the California wildfires.  
Communications between first responders is vitally important for immediate real-time 
information sharing during all threats, hazards, or incidents.  Thus, I am committed to ensuring 
that our first responders can communicate effectively and the request for CISA includes $167.3 
million for emergency communications towards this effort. 
 
I greatly appreciate the Congress authorizing the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction 
Office (CWMD) last year.  CWMD leads provides the subject matter expertise and helps to 
equip the Department’s field operators so they may effectively defend against weapons of mass 
destruction, including potential terrorist use of WMD.  The President’s Budget continues to 
enable our efforts to develop a robust and technologically advanced analytic capability 
combating chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats to the homeland and our 
interests.  Additionally, funding is requested for the Radiation Portal Monitor Replacement 
Program (RPM RP) supporting CBP’s operational effectiveness at the Nation’s land, sea, and air 
ports of entry.  Ensuring the effective and safe movement of goods through our ports, the RPM 
technology provides the cost-effective capability to scan cargo for radiological and nuclear 
threats without an adverse impact to the flow of commerce.   
 
The U.S. Secret Service carries out the unique and integrated missions of protecting senior 
leadership and investigating threats to the nation’s financial system.  Best known for protecting 
the President, the Vice President, their immediate families, visiting heads of state, and other 
designated individuals, the Secret Service also protects the White House Complex, the Vice-
President’s Residence, foreign diplomatic missions, and other designated buildings.  Further, it 
coordinates security at designated National Special Security Events such as the State of the 
Union Address.  Vitally important to our economic way of life, the Secret Service protects our 
financial infrastructure by investigating counterfeiting, crimes related to financial securities of 
the United States, identity theft, and computer fraud.  The President’s Budget includes $33.4 
million to hire additional Special Agents, Uniform Division Officers, and administrative, 
professional, and technical personnel to achieve an end strength of 7,777, the highest in Secret 
Service history.  The 2020 Presidential Election is only 18 months away, and the Budget 
includes almost $151 million to ensure that the 2020 Presidential Campaign is adequately 
resourced for the protection of major candidates, nominees, their spouses, and nominating 
conventions. 
 
Finally, since our founding, DHS agencies have operated in temporary spaces and in offices 
scattered throughout D.C. metropolitan area.  This has made it difficult for 240,000 employees to 
operate as “one” Department.  But starting in April 2019, we have a new base of operations.  
After many years, we have finally moved onto the St. Elizabeths Campus in Southeast 
Washington, D.C.; the home of the new DHS Headquarters.  The FY 2020 budget requests $224 
million ensuring momentum into this first class facility.  St. Elizabeths will become the primary 
hub of a more focused, more unified, more effective, Department of Homeland Security.  We 
have this Committee to thank for the historic move, and I look forward to welcoming all of you 
to visit. 
 
I continue to be amazed by the professionalism, dedication, and conviction that the DHS 
6 
 
employees exhibit on a daily basis.  Their resolve and devotion to the homeland security mission 
is on display daily, and the security of our nation depends on Congress properly resourcing the 
very people charged with safeguarding the American people, our Homeland, and our values.  
 
The FY 2020 President’s Budget requests the necessary funding for the Department of 
Homeland Security to carry out its wide-ranging, day-to-day mission.  We are challenged 
everyday with crises spanning Southwest Border security to daily cyber-attacks, and I call on 
Congress to assure the security of our Nation by providing the proper funding required to do our 
jobs.     
 
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you and discuss the Department’s FY 2020 
Budget submission.  I look forward to taking your questions.

Statement of 
 
James Bridenstine 
Administrator 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
 
before the 
 
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies 
Committee on Appropriations 
United States Senate 
 
 
Overview 
 
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss 
NASA's FY 2020 budget request of $21 billion.  This budget represents a significant step in pursuit of the 
ambitious, long-term goals set for the Agency in legislation and in Space Policy Directive-1.   
 
NASA is going forward to the Moon.  On March 26, 2019, the Vice President announced at a meeting of 
the National Space Council in Huntsville, Alabama, that, at the direction of the President of the United 
States, it is the stated policy of this Administration and the United States of America to return American 
astronauts to the Moon within five years and that, when the first American astronauts return to the lunar 
surface, they will take their first steps on the Moon’s South Pole.  NASA is laying out a plan to 
accomplish this charge and will submit a FY 2020 Budget Amendment in the near future for necessary 
expenses for continued activities in support of establishment of a United States strategic presence on the 
Moon by 2024.  Our goal is to leverage and build upon our existing work and plans to achieve these new 
goals. 
 
We are building a sustainable, open architecture that returns humanity to our nearest neighbor as the next 
step in our long-term drive to send humans to the Moon and on to Mars.  We are moving fast; we are 
incentivizing speed, and we are going to start taking “shots on goal” almost immediately.  We are 
completing development of Orion, the spacecraft that will carry humans to lunar orbit, and the Space 
Launch System (SLS), the rocket that will launch Orion.  We are pressing forward toward an uncrewed 
test flight of Orion around the Moon and we are working to launch the Power Propulsion Element (PPE) 
in 2022, the first element of the Lunar Gateway, a spacecraft that will orbit the Moon and support future 
landings.  Once habitation capability is added, the Gateway will serve as a reusable command module, 
supporting human missions to the surface of the Moon and giving us access to the entire lunar surface.  
Working with commercial partners and international partners, we seek to land humans on the surface of 
the Moon.  We look forward to receiving industry proposals this July and moving forward on an 
ambitious schedule. 
 
We are building for the long term, and this time are going to the Moon to stay.  A sustainable exploration 
plan requires that we build within realistically available resources.  We are designing an open, durable, 
2 
 
reusable architecture that will support exploration for decades to come.  Sustainability requires reusable 
systems and an openness to partnerships from across the commercial sector and around the world.   
 
We are actively seeking partner contributions and participation.  NASA is working to identify partnership 
opportunities that widen the pool of resources, enhance sustainability, and advance our most important 
exploration objectives. 
 
Sustainability requires that we remain focused on the next goal beyond the Moon.  Systems we develop 
for lunar exploration will be designed to contribute to a human exploration mission to Mars where 
feasible.  Beyond developing, testing, and demonstrating the technology we need for the journey, we need 
to understand the destination.  Humans have, in fact, been exploring Mars for decades.  We have moved 
from landers to small solar-powered rovers, and on to large nuclear-powered rovers.  At the same time, 
we have invested in critical infrastructure in orbit around the planet.  With the FY 2020 request, NASA 
will go beyond current capabilities to begin developing a Mars Sample Return mission, a high priority of 
the scientific community as well as an important precursor to human exploration. 
 
NASA has proposed establishment of a new Moon to Mars Mission Directorate, which will manage 
systems development and technology investments for programs critical to the Agency’s Exploration 
Campaign in an integrated manner, including all key lunar and cislunar activities as well as all technology 
development and demonstration activities.  The Exploration Campaign relies on seamless collaboration 
across the Agency, including human exploration and operations in low-Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond, 
technology development, and elements of science, as well as the rapidly advancing capabilities of our 
commercial partners.  It draws upon decades of experience and data from our continuing efforts in LEO.  
NASA has played a pivotal role in enabling the ongoing and rapid expansion of commercial activity in 
LEO.  Our commercial partners are set to make history – sending humans into space on commercially-
developed, -owned, and -operated systems this year.  This has been a long process, beginning with regular 
commercial cargo deliveries to the International Space Station (ISS); it will soon bring human spaceflight 
launches back to American soil.  NASA is working to extend this success with commercial partners to the 
Moon and beyond.    
 
The FY 2020 budget request supports our continuing efforts to improve the performance and safety of 
aircraft, crewed and uncrewed, here on Earth.  NASA’s Aeronautics research is returning to the X-plane 
business; our Low Boom Flight Demonstration Project (LBFD) is working toward a first flight of the X-
59 QueSST supersonic flight demonstrator in FY 2022.  We will push the sound barrier once again, this 
time with the goal of making practical commercial supersonic travel a reality, while again helping to 
foster economic activity.   
 
Much of NASA’s current infrastructure was built to support the Apollo Program.  Sustainability also 
includes the ability of our infrastructure, capabilities, and facilities to effectively and efficiently support 
our missions, while including sufficient flexibility to meet future needs as we continue to explore.  This 
budget includes significant new investments in NASA’s mission support activities, to ensure that 
exploration in space is not limited by our capabilities on the ground. 
 
NASA also remains committed to exploring and discovering worlds that humans may still be many 
decades, or even centuries, from visiting.  NASA robotic missions have visited all the planets of the solar 
system, and the Parker Solar Probe is preparing to touch the Sun’s atmosphere.  While the long-lived 
Opportunity Rover has finally ceased functioning, the even longer-lived Voyager spacecraft has left the 
solar system.  The search for life beyond Earth takes its next step with our planned mission to Europa. 
The unparalleled James Webb Space Telescope will open a new chapter in humanity’s ongoing quest to 
explore and understand our universe.      
 
 
 
3 
 
NASA’s focus on exploration also extends to the one planet known to support life.  Exploring the Earth as 
a system from space, NASA is our leading source of information on the how the planet works, how the 
climate is changing, and what the future holds.  No planet is more important to explore than our own.  
With a fleet of spacecraft operating in orbit NASA will continue its world-leading role exploring the 
home planet.  
 
With the James Webb Space Telescope poised to look out into the cosmos and back to the time when the 
first stars were forming, humans landing on the Moon, and constellations of spacecraft exploring the solar 
system, NASA’s FY 2020 request supports what is truly a golden age of exploration.   
 
Human Exploration and Operations 
 
The FY 2020 budget request supports bold new steps in NASA’s Exploration Campaign.  The United 
States will lead the return of humans to the Moon for long-term exploration and utilization, followed by 
human missions to Mars and other destinations.  The request provides the FY 2020 resources NASA 
needs to develop the SLS rocket and Orion crew vehicle, as well as the other critical technologies and 
research needed to support a robust exploration program.  The budget supports NASA’s plan to use a 
commercial rocket to deliver to cislunar orbit the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) as the foundation 
of a Lunar Gateway no earlier than 2022.  
 
The FY 2020 request includes $5,021.7 million for Deep Space Exploration Systems, and $4,285.7 
million for Low-Earth Orbit and Spaceflight Operations, including the ISS and Space Transportation – 
both commercial crew system development and ongoing crew and cargo transportation services that 
resupply the ISS.  
 
NASA will continue its mission in LEO with the ISS to enable exploration, while continuing to perform 
research that benefits humanity, supporting National Laboratory research by private industry and other 
organizations, and working towards reducing operations and maintenance costs.  NASA will create new 
opportunities for collaboration with industry on the ISS and develop public-private partnerships for 
exploration systems that will extend human presence into the solar system.  NASA is working to 
transition our work in LEO, including our international partnerships, to be based on commercially-
provided space station services that help enable deep space exploration and private sector expansion in 
LEO.  To support this transition, the ISS will focus near-term activities on supporting commercial 
industry as well as meeting government requirements in LEO.  In parallel, NASA is creating a focused 
effort aimed at long-term American operations in LEO independent of the ISS.   
 
Under the auspices of the ISS National Laboratory, managed by the Center for the Advancement of 
Science In Space (CASIS), NASA and CASIS continue to expand research on the ISS sponsored by 
pharmaceutical, technology, consumer product, and other industries, as well as by other government 
agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.  Through the 
joint efforts of NASA and CASIS, the ISS National Lab has reached full capacity for allocated crew time 
and upmass and downmass.  
 
Space life and physical science research will continue to follow the guidance of the National Academies’ 
decadal studies.  NASA-sponsored researchers will be a major user of the ISS and an early user of new 
commercial platforms as they:  enable exploration with research in fluid physics, combustion, 
microbiology, food production, and animal models; and produce knowledge for use on Earth in materials 
science, complex fluids, and fundamental cold atom physics.  Space life and physical science research 
expertise will be shared with new Governmental, commercial, and academic researchers to accelerate 
their productive use of LEO for research and technology development and increase demand for LEO 
capability.   
 
 
4 
 
 
NASA’s Human Research Program (HRP) will continue to conduct cutting-edge research on the effects 
of spaceflight on the human body, including experiments that require the microgravity environment of the 
ISS.  HRP will support the development of deep space exploration habitat concepts to ensure crew health 
and performance risks are adequately addressed.  
 
Maintaining the ISS requires service providers to sustain a regular supply line of both crew and cargo.  
Under the original Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contracts, our two commercial cargo partners, 
Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) and Northrop Grumman, have provided cargo deliveries to the 
ISS.  Using the launch vehicles developed in partnership with NASA, SpaceX has helped to bring some 
of the commercial satellite launch market back to the United States and has contributed to a reduction of 
launch costs.  Northrop Grumman has begun to explore commercial markets by offering LEO missions 
for up to a year after their ISS cargo mission is completed.  Under new CRS-2 contracts, SpaceX, 
Northrop Grumman, and Sierra Nevada Corporation will deliver critical science, research, and technology 
demonstrations to the ISS over five years from 2020 through 2024.  The addition of Sierra Nevada will 
add the unique capability to return cargo to various runways, enabling quicker return of cargo for ISS 
users.   
 
NASA and its commercial partners, Boeing and SpaceX, will soon make history as they prepare to launch 
humans to the ISS.  Before the companies can begin regularly flying long-duration missions to the 
orbiting laboratory, they first need to demonstrate their systems’ capabilities through a series of flight 
tests.  SpaceX’s uncrewed Demo-1 launched on March 2, 2019, successfully docked to the ISS, re-entered 
Earth’s atmosphere, and was recovered after splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean.  Boeing is planning 
for an uncrewed launch in August 2019.  Through NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, American 
astronauts will soon launch to orbit from American soil for the first time since the Space Shuttle retired in 
2011.  Further, for the first time in history, humans will travel to space on systems owned, built, tested, 
and operated by private companies.  The recent flight of the Crew Dragon and upcoming flight of the 
CST-100 Starliner will demonstrate the enormous potential of commercial partnerships for the human 
exploration and development of space.  The NASA and SpaceX teams are assessing the anomaly that 
occurred on April 20, during the Dragon Super Draco Static Fire Test at SpaceX Landing Zone 1 in 
Florida.  Any necessary adjustments will be made and we will safely move forward with our Commercial 
Crew Program. 
 
Through the Commercial LEO Development program, NASA will continue to leverage its resources and 
capabilities to enable the development of a commercial market in LEO.  The program’s first solicitation 
activity, which will go out in the next few months, will support the development of new commercial LEO 
platforms and capabilities.  These partnerships will further accelerate the transition of human spaceflight 
operations in low-Earth orbit to commercial partners for NASA and non-NASA needs.  
 
NASA is building a deep space launch and crew system – the Orion spacecraft, the heavy-lift SLS launch 
vehicle, and the supporting Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) – to support the Exploration Campaign.  
The SLS Block 1 cargo variant will be capable of delivering Orion to cislunar space in the early 2020s.  
While more powerful SLS configurations remain an important future capability, recent delays in SLS core 
stage manufacturing require that NASA concentrate in the near term on the successful completion of EM-
1 and EM-2 rather than split attention between EM-1, EM-2, and developing an upgraded upper stage.   
As a result, the pending budget defers SLS Block 1B final development efforts.  The Orion crew vehicle 
will carry up to four humans to the lunar vicinity for up to 21 days, and when combined with additional 
habitation can support longer-duration missions.  The Orion will also be able to provide key initial life-
support and abort capabilities to Gateway.   
 
 
 
5 
 
The budget request supports a planned SLS/Orion mission, Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1) that would 
send an uncrewed Orion spacecraft around the Moon.  This would be followed by the first crewed 
SLS/Orion mission, Exploration Mission-2 (EM-2) and an annual launch cadence thereafter.  The EM-1 
and EM-2 launch dates are under review pending completion of independent assessments of core stage 
production and the integrated mission schedule.  In early March, the Human Exploration and Operations 
Mission Directorate (HEOMD) chartered an assessment to evaluate alternate approaches for hardware 
processing and facilities utilization for key components, with the goal of maintaining an early as possible 
EM-1 launch date.  To date the following has been concluded:   
 
  The 45-day study identified production and operations opportunities that help provide some 
schedule savings for EM-1 while identifying minimal change to the risk posture.   
 
  An alternate assembly plan has been adopted to assemble the entire Core Stage in parallel with 
the engine section, then mate the engine section horizontally.  Vertical final outfitting will occur 
at Stennis Space Center.  This alternate assembly approach will result in reducing the time the 
vehicle will be at Michoud Assembly Facility by approximately 3.5 months. 
 
  Orion will remove propellant and consumables not needed for the mission; this reduction in Orion 
mass will provide up to 3 days of additional launch window opportunities. 
 
  Even with the changes described above, it will not be possible to meet the previously-planned 
EM-1 launch target of no earlier than (NET) June 2020.  NASA and its contractors are working to 
address the programs’ performance issues and prevent further delays. 
 
Next, an independent schedule risk review led by the NASA Office of the Chief Financial Officer will 
evaluate the HEOMD assessment to include the integrated, detailed schedule and associated risk factors 
ahead of EM-1.  NASA leadership will review the results of these assessments in late spring 2019 at an 
Agency Program Management Council, before revising the EM-1 and EM-2 launch planning dates.  
NASA remains focused on the major risk areas associated with first-time production and testing of the 
SLS core stage, integrated assembly and test of the Orion crew and service module, and integrated 
operations at the Kennedy Space Center.  The FY 2020 budget fully funds the Agency baseline 
commitment schedule for EM-2 and the Orion spacecraft and enables NASA to begin work on post-EM-2 
missions.  SLS, Orion, and EGS are critical capabilities for maintaining and extending U.S. human 
spaceflight leadership beyond LEO to the Moon, Mars, and beyond and NASA is working hard with the 
program’s contractors to ensure the program’s performance improves.  
 
As a key part of the Exploration Campaign, NASA will establish the Lunar Gateway, a small way station 
that will orbit the Moon and enable human and robotic missions to the lunar surface. The Lunar Gateway 
will support exploration on and around the Moon, and sustainable human lunar surface exploration 
missions by supporting reusable human lunar landers.  It will be a temporary home for astronauts and will 
foster growing domestic and international economic opportunities for commercial logistics and refueling 
services, as well as providing robust communications with spacecraft in cislunar space and on the lunar 
surface.     
 
The PPE is the first element of the Lunar Gateway which will be launched on a commercial rocket in 
2022 and placed in orbit around the Moon.  The PPE will demonstrate advanced high-power solar-electric 
propulsion (SEP) bus systems that will support both future NASA and commercial applications.  The PPE 
will supply power and propulsion for elements and systems on the Lunar Gateway as well as 
communication to and from Earth, other spacecraft, and missions to the lunar surface.  The Lunar 
Gateway is intended to be capable of supporting human-class lander deployments and operations.  Once 
 
 
6 
 
the PPE and minimal habitation capabilities have been delivered to cislunar space, a crew of four - 
launched on Orion - will be able to visit the Lunar Gateway on their way to the lunar surface.   
 
The Lunar Gateway will be launched on competitively procured commercial launch vehicles and 
assembled in orbit around the Moon where it will be used immediately as a staging point for missions to 
the lunar surface. It can evolve depending on mission needs, and will support human-class reusable 
landers, landing a crew of up to four astronauts on the lunar surface and ultimately developing sustaining 
lunar operations on the Moon.  This budget integrates the NASA Docking System (NDS) into the 
modules of the Lunar Gateway, reducing development cost and allowing NASA, international and 
commercial partners to easily dock with Lunar Gateway to support lunar landers (including reusable 
human landers), the Lunar Gateway itself and science objectives.  Further, the early development of 
commercial docking and delivery capabilities will be essential for developing a sustainable and scalable 
lunar program.  Delivery of Lunar Gateway and lunar lander elements, including refueling of these 
elements, will create a reusable hub for sustainable lunar activity and feed forward to Mars.  The Gateway 
and lunar surface campaign will benefit from components being provided by International partners.  The 
Gateway will be functional for lunar surface support with the addition of a utilization module planned as 
the next element after the PPE element. 
 
NASA is supporting the development of commercial lunar exploration capabilities leading to a human 
lunar landing.  NASA is focused on engaging U.S. industry partners using innovative approaches to 
combine lunar robotics, a cislunar presence, and lunar landing capabilities building up to a human-rated 
lander.  NASA’s lunar efforts will incorporate results from the following. 
 
  The Lunar Cargo Transportation and Landing by Soft Touchdown (CATALYST) initiative, 
established in 2014, is encouraging the development of U.S. private-sector robotic lunar landers 
capable of successfully delivering payloads to the lunar surface using U.S. commercial launch 
capabilities.       
 
  Through Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS), NASA selected nine U.S. companies to 
bid on delivery services to the lunar surface.  Lunar payloads from a variety of customers, 
including NASA, will fly on contracted missions starting in 2020, enabling critical technology 
demonstrations and scientific observations.  
   
  The budget request supports commercial development of a large lunar lander that will ultimately 
carry astronauts to the surface of the Moon.  NASA issued a solicitation on February 7, 2019 to 
seek proposals from industry for human lander system studies, risk reduction, development, and 
spaceflight demonstrations.  These Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships 
(NextSTEP) will enable rapid development and flight demonstrations of human lunar landers by 
supporting critical studies and risk reduction activities, maturing requirements, tailoring 
applicable standards, and creating technology maturation plans. 
 
  NASA and its industrial partners are also working on NextSTEP habitation systems to develop 
concepts for cislunar habitats and to conduct ground-based testing of prototype habitats to 
evaluate human factors, validate subsystem integration, and test standard interfaces.  The 
knowledge gained from testing the NextSTEP habitats will reduce risk in the design of the 
Gateway.  
 
Missions to the Moon and cislunar space will also serve as a stepping-stone, a training ground, 
and a platform to strengthen commercial and international partnerships and prepare for future 
human missions to Mars and other destinations.  
 
 
7 
 
 
The FY 2020 budget request provides for critical infrastructure indispensable to the Nation’s access to 
and use of space, including those provided under the Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) 
Program, the Communication Services Program, the Launch Services Program, Rocket Propulsion 
Testing, and Human Space Flight Operations. 
 
Human missions to the Moon and Mars will require advanced space communications and navigation 
capabilities.  SCaN’s technology development effort invests in leading-edge communications 
technologies to enable, improve, and mature spacecraft communication and navigation technologies.  
NASA is conducting studies to identify future technologies under development that can be infused to 
support NASA exploration missions in the 2022-and-beyond timeframe.  These studies include Requests 
for Information and funded Broad Area Announcements to leverage the creativity of industry partners 
through mechanisms such as public-private partnerships that will be central to NASA's future 
communications architecture.  NASA is also initiating a Communications Services Program, based on our 
successful Launch Services Program, which will begin work towards matching future NASA missions 
with communications services furnished by commercial providers.   
 
Exploration Technology 
 
NASA’s FY 2020 request includes $1,014.3 million for Exploration Technology to accelerate technology 
development to enable human and robotic exploration of the Moon and Mars and foster commercial 
expansion in LEO and beyond.  Technology drives exploration with investments spanning the 
Technology Readiness Level (TRL) spectrum, advancing early-stage concepts and maturing key 
technologies and systems that enable demonstrations in relevant environments.         
 
Within Exploration Technology, NASA will accelerate development of lunar surface technologies 
through the Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative, driving new essential technologies required for humans 
to successfully operate on the lunar surface.  Utilizing the five-year horizon, NASA will transition key 
technologies through the ground demonstration phase toward flight demonstrations.  The Lunar Surface 
Innovation Initiative will include the technology areas highlighted below. 
 
  NASA is developing the technologies to make use of resources available on the Moon, on Mars, 
and on other planetary bodies (in situ resources).  This technology holds the potential to produce 
consumables, including oxygen, water, and hydrogen on the Moon, thereby reducing mission 
mass, cost, and risk of human exploration.   
 
  In order to address power requirements for long-duration human missions to the lunar surface, 
NASA is continuing work on its Kilopower technology project to demonstrate a small, 
lightweight fission power system.  The Kilopower project will transition into a demonstration 
mission in FY 2020 that would permit long-duration crewed missions on the surface of the Moon. 
 
The Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative will bring together the full range of stakeholders, including 
entrepreneurs, academia, small businesses, industry, and the NASA workforce to catalyze technology and 
systems development. 
 
Additionally, computer systems for spaceflight are exposed to a hostile radiation environment that can 
impact performance and reliability.  NASA will address this challenge in FY 2020 by testing a powerful, 
radiation-hardened computer processor that will enable advanced precision landing, hazard avoidance, 
and autonomous operations.   
 
 
 
8 
 
NASA plans to launch two Exploration Technology demonstration missions in 2019:  the Green 
Propellant Infusion Mission spacecraft, and the Deep Space Atomic Clock instrument will both be 
delivered to orbit as part of the U.S. Air Force Space Test Program-2 mission.  The Green Propellant 
Infusion Mission demonstrates a propulsion system that could reduce spacecraft processing costs by 
replacing hydrazine propellant with a propellant that is less toxic and has approximately 40 percent higher 
performance by volume.  The Deep Space Atomic Clock will demonstrate the potential of a 50-fold 
increase in clock accuracy for improved deep space navigation and improved gravity science 
measurements. 
 
NASA is working to an August 2020 launch readiness date for its Laser Communications Relay 
Demonstration project.  The project will demonstrate optical communications technology in an 
operational setting, providing data rates up to 100 times faster than today’s radio-frequency-based 
communication systems.   
 
In 2020, the Solar Electric Propulsion project will complete the Critical Design Review for the electric 
propulsion subsystem, and build qualification units to conduct qualification testing of the Solar Electric 
Propulsion engineering development units for the high-power electric propulsion string.  The first 
demonstration of this system will be the 50-kilowatt-class PPE for NASA’s Lunar Gateway spacecraft.  
 
Other technology development that Exploration Technology supports includes critical technology for the 
Mars 2020 mission to be delivered this year; inflatable aerodynamic decelerator technology which could 
enable high mass Entry, Descent, and Landing on Mars; and In-Space Robotic Manufacturing and 
Assembly, with the potential to revolutionize exploration.  These and many more technology efforts are 
enabling NASA’s most challenging missions.  
 
Science 
 
NASA’s Science Mission Directorate leverages space-, air-, and ground-based assets to answer 
fundamental questions about the Earth, the solar system and the universe, and our place in the cosmos.  
Our scientists, engineers, and technologists work with a global community of researchers to provide the 
scientific discoveries that advance critical understanding and inform decision-making.  Whether through 
disaster response, natural resource management, planetary defense, or space weather monitoring, NASA 
provides tangible benefits that help protect and improve life on Earth.  At the same time, NASA is leading 
the quest to answer some of most pressing human questions, among them how Earth and the universe 
evolved, how life emerged, and whether we are alone in the universe. 
 
The FY 2020 budget requests $6,303.7 million for NASA Science, including $2,622.1 million for 
Planetary Science, $844.8 million for Astrophysics, $352.5 million for JWST, $704.5 million for 
Heliophysics, and $1,779.8 million for Earth Science.  The budget enables NASA to continue advancing 
national science and exploration goals while maintaining its global leadership position through a balanced 
and integrated science program.  This year’s budget request reflects a concerted effort to seek and execute 
new partnerships that will allow the Agency to leverage the innovation, resources, and know-how of the 
full breadth of the global science enterprise, including other U.S. and foreign agencies, as well as 
commercial, academic, and other non-Governmental partners.   
 
Science remains critical to the exploration goals of the Agency, contributing both capabilities and 
knowledge needed to advance human and robotic exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond.  The Lunar 
Discovery and Exploration program advances an integrated strategy for exploration, not only through 
improved collaboration across the Agency but also by leveraging interagency, international, and 
commercial partnerships.  In November 2018, NASA selected nine U.S. companies to bid on delivery 
services to the lunar surface through Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contracts.  Lunar 
 
 
9 
 
payloads from a variety of customers, including NASA, will fly on contracted missions starting in 2020, 
enabling critical technology demonstrations and scientific observations; most recently, NASA selected 10 
proposals for the Development and Advancement of Lunar Instrumentation (DALI) program, which will 
support instruments that will fly on future lunar missions.  NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter 
(LRO), which marks its tenth anniversary in 2019, continues to help scientists characterize the lunar 
surface, providing insights into lunar resource analysis that could support future human exploration.   
 
NASA’s Planetary Science Division develops and operates increasingly sophisticated missions to reveal 
new knowledge of our Solar System’s content, origin, evolution, and the potential for life elsewhere.  
With spacecraft in place from the innermost planet to the very edge of the Sun's influence, this year’s 
budget request reinvigorates robotic exploration of our Solar System, supporting the long-term scientific 
study of the Moon, Mars, and beyond.   
 
NASA’s robust Mars Exploration Program continues to achieve great things.  In November 2018, the 
Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) lander reached 
the Martian surface, marking the Agency’s eighth successful soft landing on the Red Planet.  A robot 
geologist, InSight will yield new discoveries about the Martian interior, providing an unprecedented look 
at its core structure and heat flow.  Cruising behind InSight were two experimental, briefcase-sized 
spacecraft named Mars Cube One (MarCO) – the first ever planetary CubeSats – which successfully 
relayed data back to Earth from the InSight lander during its descent to the Martian surface.   
 
The budget request also supports continued progress of the Mars 2020 rover, which – after an intensive 
effort to identify the most promising landing site – will head to the Jezero Crater following a July 2020 
launch.  A precursor to human missions to Mars, Mars 2020 will continue to search for evidence of life on 
the Red Planet and collect a cache of core samples.   
 
In 2020, NASA will commence studies and development of a Mars Sample Return mission – the highest 
priority strategic mission identified by the scientific community in the most recent planetary science 
decadal survey and endorsed in the 2018 midterm assessment – that would allow for the return of the 
Mars 2020 rover samples.  Leveraging commercial and international partnerships, such as with the 
European Space Agency, this mission may launch as early as 2026.   
 
Beyond Mars, NASA will continue development of the next Discovery missions, Lucy and Psyche, as 
well as the cutting-edge Europa Clipper strategic mission to fly by Jupiter’s moon – a first step in 
exploring ocean worlds and their potential habitability.  And just this year, NASA celebrated the first 
flyby of a Kuiper Belt object (MU69/Ultima Thule) with our New Horizons mission.  The data collected 
from over four billion miles away from Earth will help answer basic questions about the surface 
properties, geology, and atmospheres of these primitive bodies.   
 
In December 2018, NASA’s first asteroid sampling mission, the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, 
Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx), entered orbit around Bennu, the 
smallest object a spacecraft has ever orbited.  In 2020, OSIRIS-REx will have completed its mapping of 
Bennu, informing selection of the most promising sample collection site.  Its measurements of this 
potentially hazardous object (Bennu’s orbit could bring it relatively close to Earth at the end of the next 
century), will not only shed light on the early history of our Solar System, but will also inform the design 
of future missions to mitigate possible asteroid impacts on Earth.   
 
Built as a cohesive, international program for Near-Earth Object (NEO) detection and mitigation 
technology development, NASA’s Planetary Defense Program will continue to fund the NEO 
Observations project and development of a space-based infrared instrument for detecting NEOs with this 
year’s budget request.  Meanwhile, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) to demonstrate the 
 
 
10 
 
kinetic impact technique for asteroid deflection will continue to make progress towards its planned 2021 
launch.   
 
NASA’s Astrophysics Division seeks to understand the universe and our place in it, probing how it works 
and peering into the origin and evolution of galaxies and stars.  Through a coordinated program of 
research, space-based missions, and technology development, it also explores the formation of planetary 
systems and seeks to understand how habitable environments develop, a key aspect of the search for life 
in the universe. 
 
In 2018, NASA bid farewell to the Kepler mission, after nine years of searching for planets outside our 
Solar System.  Kepler discovered almost 2,700 new exoplanets, bringing the total from all sources to over 
3,900 known exoplanets.  Kepler’s legacy serves as the foundation for NASA’s next planet-hunting 
mission, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), launched in April 2018.  TESS has already 
found 12 new exoplanets, including four new multi-planet systems.  During its two-year primary mission, 
TESS will observe nearly the whole sky, providing a rich catalog of worlds around nearby stars, including 
valuable targets for the James Webb Space Telescope to explore.  The 2020 budget accommodates the 
funds needed to support the revised March 2021 launch date of the James Webb Space Telescope, the 
largest and most powerful space telescope to be developed to date.  Webb will join NASA’s family of 
observatories to examine the first stars and galaxies that formed, viewing the atmospheres of nearby 
planets outside our solar system and informing our understanding of the evolution of our own solar 
system.   
 
The budget request also supports operations for the airborne Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared 
Astronomy (SOFIA), a partnership with the German Aerospace Center; SOFIA will complete its five-year 
prime mission in 2019.  Flying into the stratosphere above 99 percent of Earth’s infrared-blocking 
atmosphere, SOFIA allows astronomers to study the solar system and beyond in ways that are not 
possible with ground-based telescopes, from almost anywhere in the world.   
 
In order to maintain a balanced science program that optimizes overall scientific return, the FY 2020 
budget request again proposes termination of the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST),  
given its significant cost and higher priorities within NASA, including completing the delayed James 
Webb Space Telescope. 
 
The budget also enables NASA to fully support competed Astrophysics missions and research, and follow 
the decadal- survey-recommended cadence of new Astrophysics Explorers missions.  By the end of FY 
2019, NASA plans to release Announcements of Opportunity for the next Astrophysics Small Explorer 
and Mission of Opportunity missions for an initial selection in 2020.   
 
NASA’s Heliophysics Division studies the nature of the Sun, how it affects Earth and other objects in the 
solar system, and the very nature of space itself.  Understanding the Sun and its interactions with the 
space environment, including near-Earth space, helps scientists identify the causes and impacts of space 
weather phenomena, which can threaten spacecraft and astronauts, and affect human technological 
infrastructure and activities, both on and around Earth, and beyond. 
 
The Heliophysics Division adopts a holistic approach to the study of the Sun and its connection to Earth 
and other planets – venturing to the very edge of the Sun’s influence and beyond.  In December 2018, 
Voyager 2 exited the heliosphere, the protective bubble of particles and magnetic fields created by the 
Sun, a milestone only achieved once before – by Voyager 1 in 2012.  In over 40 years in space, Voyager 2 
has traveled a staggering 18.5 billion miles and is NASA’s longest-running mission.   
 
 
 
11 
 
In 2018, several successful launches also expanded the Heliophysics System Observatory, including the 
January 2018 launch of the Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) instrument, and the 
August 2018 launch of the Parker Solar Probe, which completed its first of 24 planned orbits around the 
Sun in January 2019.  Together with GOLD, the Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) instrument 
launching in 2019 will provide the most comprehensive observations of the ionosphere – a region of 
charged particles in Earth’s upper atmosphere.  In July 2018, NASA selected the Interstellar Mapping and 
Acceleration Probe (IMAP), identified as a priority in the most recent solar and space physics decadal 
survey, to launch in 2024 to study the boundary of the outer solar system where the solar wind ends.  
Also, in 2020, NASA will launch Solar Orbiter, a joint collaboration led by the European Space Agency, 
into orbit around the Sun in order to better understand the dynamics of the heliosphere. 
 
NASA continues to work with its agency partners to reduce gaps between space weather research and 
operations.  The budget initiates the Heliophysics Space Weather Science and Applications project to 
further strengthen the feedback between fundamental research and operational forecasting needs by 
improving the transition of science results into operational products.  The budget also provides for a 
potential new Small Explorer-class space weather mission.  This will lay the groundwork for a future 
Space Weather Mission line to focus on resolving fundamental science problems required to improve 
space weather prediction, and serve as a pathfinder for observation technology for the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) operational space weather missions.  
 
NASA’s Earth Science Division develops and operates space-based and airborne missions that obtain 
revolutionary observations of our planet.  NASA Earth Science works with the scientific community to 
coordinate and integrate measurements to improve quantitative understanding of our planet and accurately 
model Earth’s complex system of interacting processes.  The program also teams with government and 
commercial partners in the U.S. and internationally to use the measurements and understanding to 
develop and demonstrate applications that will provide direct benefit to our Nation, and indeed all of 
humanity. 
 
In 2018, NASA launched two strategic missions recommended by the 2007 Earth Science decadal survey: 
Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO); and Ice, Cloud and land Elevation 
Satellite-2 (ICESat-2).  The twin satellites of GRACE-FO are continuing the original GRACE mission’s 
15-year legacy (2002-2017) of measuring the changing mass of ice sheets and glaciers and tracking 
Earth’s water movement across the planet.  ICESat-2, the follow-on to NASA’s ICESat mission (2003-
2009), is providing unprecedented data on the topography of ice, forests, and oceans.  In November 2018, 
the Operation IceBridge 2018 Antarctic Field Campaign concluded successfully after flying under 
ICESat-2 orbits to validate and verify the new satellite’s measurements. 
 
In addition, NASA Earth Science is collaborating with the Human Exploration and Operations Mission 
Directorate to utilize the ISS for Earth observations.  NASA Earth Science launched two low-cost, 
competitively selected missions to the ISS in 2018.  The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer 
Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) instrument is measuring agricultural water use, vegetation 
stress, and drought warning conditions.  In December 2018, the similarly low-cost, competitively selected 
Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) vegetation canopy lidar instrument was launched to 
the ISS and is now embarked on its science mission to make 3D maps of the world’s forests. 
 
Launching to the ISS in spring 2019, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) instrument will 
continue measurements of the complex dynamics of Earth’s carbon cycle, increasing understanding of the 
regional sources and sinks of carbon dioxide.  The FY 2020 budget request also funds continued progress 
of Landsat 9 for a launch as early as FY 2021.  As part of the Sustained Land Imaging program 
architecture, Landsat 9 will enable continuity of the critical, long-term land imaging data record begun in 
1972 with NASA’s joint agency partner, the U.S. Geological Survey.  Consistent with the FY 2019 
 
 
12 
 
budget request, the FY 2020 request proposes termination of the Plankton Aerosol Cloud ocean 
Ecosystem (PACE), and Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory Pathfinder 
(CLARREO-PF) missions. 
 
NASA Earth Science continues to explore innovative partnerships and new approaches, including the 
acquisition of commercial data products from small satellite constellations.  In September 2018, the Earth 
Science Division awarded contracts to three commercial data products providers.  Through this pilot 
program, NASA-funded researchers will examine the scientific value of the data to help determine the 
utility of the private sector’s constellation-based products for advancing NASA’s science and applications 
development goals.  The 2020 budget request continues support for the integration of NASA Earth 
Science efforts with non-Governmental partners through these and other activities, such as commercial 
hosting and new partnerships (such as the NASA-Conservation International collaboration announced in 
February 2018).   
 
NASA Science leads the Nation on a journey of discovery through its nearly 100 missions.  In every step, 
we share the adventure with the public and partner with others to substantially improve science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) literacy and understanding nationwide.  In 2019, the 
National Academies will conduct an assessment of our Science Activation program, which since its 
establishment in 2016 has competitively selected over 25 awardees, enabling more than 200 partnerships 
that connect NASA science experts and content to learners of all ages in communities across the land. 
 
Aeronautics 
 
Aviation moves the world, and an efficient and safe air transportation system is fundamental to the future 
of the U.S. economy.  NASA’s cutting-edge aeronautics research is delivering new concepts and 
technologies which will change the face of aviation as we know it, boosting U.S. technological and 
economic leadership in this global industry and creating high quality American jobs.  The FY 2020 
budget requests $667 million for NASA aeronautics research.  
 
NASA is enabling quiet commercial supersonic flight through construction of the X-59 supersonic flight 
demonstrator, with a first flight planned for FY 2022.  NASA will then conduct a first-of-its kind, multi-
year flight research campaign over populated areas to gather data about community response to quiet 
supersonic flights, enabling domestic and international regulators to establish a new supersonic noise 
standard.  This capability will position the U.S. aviation industry to supply global customers with future 
supersonic aircraft products. 
 
NASA is collaborating with industry to investigate innovative technology for subsonic aircraft, including 
advanced wing design, transformative structures, propulsion-airframe integration, and small-core turbine 
engines.  NASA also is leading research into new components, technologies, and powertrain architectures 
for electric or hybrid electric systems that can bring about revolutionary improvements in small and large 
transport aircraft.  NASA’s work on the X-57 Maxwell aircraft – an all-electric, general-aviation-size 
plane – is already delivering important lessons to the community about designing, building, and operating 
an all-electric system.  Ground tests this year and flight tests next year will provide valuable insights into 
the challenges and opportunities of electric aircraft.  
 
Building on these activities, NASA has begun a multi-year effort to solve the technical challenges 
associated with a 1-Megawatt (MW) power electric aircraft propulsion system – enough energy to power 
165 homes.  NASA will refine concepts and technologies and validate new electric systems through 
ground and flight tests.  Realizing a practical 1-MW electric aircraft propulsion system has never been 
accomplished and is an area of notable international competition.  To support this work, NASA has 
 
 
13 
 
commissioned the world-leading NASA Electric Aircraft Test Facility (NEAT) capable of conducting 
full-scale ground tests of high-power electric propulsion systems.   
 
In addition to developing new vehicle technologies, NASA is conducting research to make design and 
manufacturing processes more efficient and reduce the time and cost to build aircraft.  Next year, NASA 
will complete the Advanced Composites Project, a six-year focused effort in partnership with industry to 
significantly reduce the time needed to develop and certify new composite structures for aerospace 
applications.   
 
In 2020, NASA will complete demonstrations of technologies to integrate operations of larger Unmanned 
Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the existing National Air Space (NAS) as well as manage smaller vehicles 
safely at lower altitudes.  Those efforts are providing the foundation for another major transformation of 
the aviation sector being led by NASA – creation of an urban air mobility (UAM) system that is safe, 
economical, and environmentally friendly to move people and packages in population centers.   
 
NASA will begin a new Advanced Air Mobility project in FY 2020 to enable the emergence of UAM.  
NASA is preparing a series of “Grand Challenges” that will provide a means to assess the maturity of key 
systems for UAM.  Through these Grand Challenges, NASA will serve as a catalyst for companies to 
rapidly develop and demonstrate their capabilities, while setting the course for needed research and 
investment.  Initial community response to NASA’s leadership in UAM has been strongly supportive.  
 
NASA research is enabling a transformed airspace system that supports efficient operations of all vehicles 
across these different market segments, and gives citizens the confidence that every flight is safe and 
secure.  NASA will complete a series of Airspace Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) with the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA), airlines, and airport operators to demonstrate new capabilities for 
managing efficient airline operations.  A final high-fidelity demonstration of all integrated system 
capabilities will support delivery of the research and development results the FAA needs to advance 
NextGen capabilities and improvements to meet the FAA's air traffic management needs.  NASA then 
will turn its attention to new research to address the safety and efficiency challenges of a more complex 
airspace supporting a broad range of new users. 
 
NASA continues its investment in unique specialized facilities and experts who conduct fundamental 
research to address key challenges in hypersonic flight. NASA coordinates closely with partners in the 
Department of Defense (DOD) to leverage DOD investment in ground and flight activities to develop and 
validate advanced physics-based computational models as building blocks towards a long-term vision for 
hypersonic flight.  At the same time, the DOD benefits from NASA hypersonics expertise, analyses, 
testing capabilities and computational models. 
 
NASA aeronautics research is conducted in partnership with the aviation community to transform 
aviation as we know it, and find solutions to aviation system needs that will provide benefits in mobility, 
environmental sustainability, and safety, while ensuring continued long-term U.S. aviation technology 
leadership in this rapidly expanding global industry.  NASA investments are enabling the early stages of 
the future airspace system that will enable all users – from UAS to UAM to traditional airlines – to 
seamlessly access the airspace and safely and efficiently, with great benefit to U.S. industry and 
passengers alike.  
 
STEM Engagement  
 
NASA’s FY 2020 budget proposes the termination of NASA’s Office of STEM Engagement and its 
portfolio of domestic assistance awards (grants and cooperative agreements), and instead prioritizes 
funding toward an innovative and inspirational program of exploration.  While the FY 2020 budget no 
 
 
14 
 
longer supports these programs, a common vision, mission and focus areas will drive NASA’s future 
endeavors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) engagement. Through its 
mission directorates, NASA will focus on: creating unique opportunities for students to contribute to 
NASA’s work in exploration and discovery; building a diverse future STEM workforce by engaging 
students in authentic learning experiences with NASA’s people, content and facilities; and strengthening 
understanding by enabling powerful connections to NASA’s mission and work. A small, focused 
functional office at NASA headquarters will be accountable for the strategic direction and coordination of 
the Agency’s STEM engagement efforts. 
 
NASA’s mission successes will continue to inspire the next generation to pursue science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics studies, join us on our journey of discovery, and become the diverse 
workforce we will need for tomorrow’s critical aerospace careers. We will use every opportunity to 
engage learners in our work and to encourage educators, students, and the public to continue making their 
own discoveries. 
 
Mission Support 
 
In this budget, NASA will simultaneously implement multiple large development programs in order to 
return to the surface of the Moon sustainably.  To be successful, NASA must have the institutional 
capabilities and facilities necessary to efficiently and effectively support these programs, which is why 
this budget proposes important new investment in Mission Support.  NASA’s mission support programs 
directly enable the Agency’s portfolio of missions.  The FY 2020 request prioritizes the capabilities, 
operations and equipment to safely operate and maintain NASA Centers and facilities, along with the 
independent technical authority required to reduce risk to life and program objectives for all NASA 
missions.  With installations in 14 states, NASA collectively manages $39 billion in assets with an 
inventory of over 5,000 buildings and structures.  Over the past 60 years, NASA has leveraged unique test 
facilities to develop new and innovative vehicles and technology for space exploration.  Now, commercial 
companies are also leveraging this unique infrastructure.  Over 80 percent of NASA facilities are beyond 
their constructed design life, and NASA faces the challenge of a deferred maintenance backlog of ~$2.3B.  
The 2020 budget includes additional funding critical to renewing our infrastructure while we continue to 
divest of unneeded, costly facilities.    
 
In the area of information technology (IT) services, NASA continues to improve management and 
strengthen NASA’s cybersecurity capabilities in order to safeguard critical systems and data.  We have 
made significant progress over the past several years, raising NASA’s score on the Federal IT Acquisition 
Reform Act (FITARA) from an “F” in 2015 to a B+ this past year.  The 2020 budget provides critical 
resources to continue strengthening cyber security protections and funding to help modernize NASA’s IT 
systems in support of future mission objectives. In FY 2020, the Agency will continue its efforts to 
implement and develop optimal solutions.  Examples include IT consolidation, automated segmentation 
architecture and end user cloud migration. NASA continues to transition its IT to an enterprise 
governance and operating model.    
 
Conclusion 
 
NASA’s FY 2020 budget request provides for the foundation of a national exploration campaign that will 
create an architecture that is open, sustainable and agile.  The Space Launch System and Orion, critical 
components of our exploration architecture, will reach important milestones in construction and testing 
this year as the program works through significant development challenges, and our new lunar command 
module, the Gateway, will see international and commercial partnerships solidified and construction 
begin.  We have called on American companies to help design and develop human lunar landers and 
reusable systems for surface activities.  In LEO, our Commercial Crew program remains strong and will 
 
 
15 
 
soon be delivering American astronauts, on American rockets, from American soil to the ISS for the first 
time since 2011.   
 
With the FY 2020 request NASA will initiate the first round-trip mission to the Red Planet with a Mars 
sample return mission, and many of the technological advancements we achieve moving forward to the 
Moon will provide critical data and capabilities for future robotic and crewed Mars missions.  We will 
continue to pursue transformative aeronautics technology as we develop the next generation of aircraft 
and make air travel safer and more efficient.  We will increase our understanding of our home planet and 
move out on ambitious programs to study the far reaches of our solar system and beyond.     
 
Mr. Chairman, I would be pleased to respond to your questions and those of other Members of the 
Subcommittee.

NOT FOR PUBLICATION 
UNTIL RELEASED BY THE SENATE 
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON DEFENSE 
 
   
Chairman Shelby, Vice Chairman Durbin, distinguished committee members. On behalf of our 
Sailors, Marines and civilian teammates, thank you for your bipartisan efforts to restore funding 
stability to the Department of the Navy.  
 
The concept of a strategy is the application of limited resources to attain a goal. Aligned to the 
National Defense Strategy, the Navy strategy for restoring readiness, strengthening relationships 
and reforming our processes has been set, and we build on that with a disciplined focus on 
people, capabilities, and processes.  
 
This budget prioritized a strategy driven, balanced approach to investment. It builds on prior 
investments, sustains the industrial base, and maintains our competitive advantage as we 
transition to a more cost imposing, survivable and affordable future force. The restoration of 
readiness is well underway and we are seeing progress each and every day. All the weathervanes 
are pointed in the correct direction, and although we might be frustrated with the velocity of the 
wind, we continue to increase it day by day. 
 
Where We Were 
At my confirmation hearing in July 2017, I stated my intent to expeditiously assess the current 
situation, develop the tools needed to enhance its ability to fight, and to deliver on the Title 10 
responsibilities of the Office of the Secretary the Navy. My priorities for accomplishing these 
goals centered on three key areas: people, capabilities, and processes. 
 
1 
 
I expressed my determination to recruit, train and retain the best of our nation for our military 
and civilian ranks, and to create a flat, lean and agile organization where those who manage 
critical situations have the ability to make decisions to solve the problems in front of them.  
 
I committed to rebuild the readiness and lethality of our capabilities, citing cumulative effects of 
16 years of wartime operational tempo, unpredictable funding, and challenges to our warfighting 
advantage as we return to a geostrategic environment dominated by great power competition. 
 
And as a businessman, I expressed my determination to improve our processes across the 
portfolio, analyzing all systems and platforms to extract additional efficiencies, incorporating 
private sector best practices, and migrating to a true continual learning enterprise. 
 
Where We Are 
Over the past year and a half, Admiral Richardson, General Neller and I have attacked these 
goals with a sense of urgency by investing in our people, capabilities and processes. 
 
To build the strength of our people, we’ve invested in a ready, relevant and responsive force: A 
Marine Corps force with 186,200 active personnel and 38,500 reservists; the Targeted Reentry 
Program to enable key former personnel a streamlined return into active-duty; quality of life and 
retention efforts like the MyNavy Career Center, which provides Sailors with human resource 
services around the clock; and the military parental leave program. We’ve used the increased 
Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) flexibility from the FY19 NDAA to 
support dynamic changes and requirements in technical expertise, agility and innovation in our 
2 
 
officers. We’ve invested in our civilian workforce, including enhanced hiring and training at our 
public shipyards to reach our FY20 goal of 36,100 personnel one year earlier than originally 
planned. 
 
We’ve enhanced our capabilities, through targeted investments in the lethality and readiness of 
our weapons platforms and munitions. We have accomplished this through strengthening our 
partnerships with the private sector. We’ve gleaned commercial best practices to increase 
efficiency and flow in our ship, ground and aviation maintenance facilities. The Navy has added 
22 Battle Force Ships over FY17 and FY18, while decommissioning nine, for a net addition of 
13 ships. The Marine Corps has reset 99% of ground equipment and returned 72% of our 
equipment to the operating forces. We have also enabled personnel to “fix it forward” through 
technologies such as additive manufacturing, including the procurement of 160 3D printers 
capable of producing over 125 ground and 83 NAVAIR-approved parts on demand.  
 
We’ve also significantly improved our operational processes, through the Comprehensive 
Review (CR) and Strategic Readiness Review (SRR).  Over the past year, the Readiness Reform 
and Oversight Council has examined 111 recommendations from the review process. 91 have 
been adjudicated and 83 have now been implemented. We’re committing the resources to make 
these changes stick, spending $173 million over this year and last, and requesting an additional 
$345.7 million in next year’s budget. Business processes were also reviewed and remediated 
after our first ever top-to-bottom audit of the Department of the Navy, and we’re using this 
information to streamline our operations and reimagine how support functions can be 
modernized in real time to drive greater readiness, lethality and efficiency.  Through the 
3 
 
development and implementation of the Navy Business Operations Plan and our Performance to 
Plan tool, we are beginning to accurately track the output impacts of our efforts. 
 
It must also be noted that the Marine Corps is contending with the unprecedented double impact 
of Hurricanes Florence and Matthew, which together damaged or destroyed more than $3.7B in 
infrastructure across many of our east coast installations. Camp Lejeune is a primary force 
generator for the Naval Services, directly contributing to the capacity and readiness of our force. 
The Marine Corps continues to feel the immediate impacts of these storms through lost and 
delayed training time; delayed deployments and redeployments; and daily quality of life 
challenges including the displacement of thousands of personnel and their families.  
 
We appreciate the work this committee has done to make available $400M of reprogrammed 
resources to the Marine Corps to immediately begin addressing our most pressing infrastructure 
needs, and we will continue to work tirelessly to address our remaining $449M shortfall within 
FY19, and the $2.8B required over FY20, FY21, and future plans to fully recover. Recovering 
from these disasters will continue to require sustained investment and the ongoing support of this 
committee.  
 
Where We Are Going 
Now that the foundation for readiness and lethality has been set, we continue to move forward 
with a sense of urgency, continually thinking of how to deliver the people, capabilities and 
processes needed by the Navy - Marine Corps Team. The Naval Services have developed plans 
informed by the National Defense Strategy, which mandates increased lethality, strengthened 
4 
 
alliances and partnerships, and improved business processes. Now we are aligning those plans 
with the right leaders, tools, budget and technology advancements.  
 
This budget request invests in our people with the education and resources necessary to develop 
and retain the human capital we need to confront a changing world. We’ll expand hiring for 
areas of critical need, such as cyber security specialists, aviation technicians, scientists and 
engineers, human resource specialists, and digital warfare officers. We’ll add end strength to the 
Marine Corps Special Operations Command. We’ll complete the rollout of Sailor 2025, updating 
policies, procedures and systems to improve retention and readiness.  
 
Education is a key component to developing the warfighter the Navy and Marine Corps Team 
needs. We will be effecting the blueprint developed by the recently released Education for 
Seapower Review, aligning and enhancing our educational institutions and distributed learning 
venues. And earlier this month, along with Secretary Esper and Secretary Wilson, I hosted 
University and College Presidents and other education leaders from across the country for a 
summit at the US Naval Academy dedicated to eliminating the scourge of campus sexual assault 
and sexual harassment.  
 
We are constantly mindful that we recruit the individual, but we retain the family. And without 
the family, we are not operating at full capacity. As I stated before this committee last month, 
upon reviewing the issues surrounding Public-Private Venture (PPV) military housing, it is clear 
that in some cases we have fallen woefully short of our obligations, and there is culpability 
around the table. We have identified the problems, and are focusing resources on the solutions. 
5 
 
We will correct bad practices and return private military housing to a premium product. This 
budget supports these efforts, with a request of $21.975 million for the oversight of the 
Department’s PPV housing worldwide. 
 
As we move from rebuilding readiness to owning the next fight, this budget prioritizes a 
balanced and strategy-driven approach, to provide for a bigger, better trained, and more ready 
force. It invests in our Force 2.0 capabilities in emerging areas such as hypersonics, applied 
artificial intelligence, machine learning, quantum computing, additive manufacturing, directed 
energy and more. We will continue to build the fleet in pursuit of the 355 ship Navy, manned and 
unmanned, to include the Columbia-class submarine, Next Generation Frigate, and remotely 
piloted platforms such as Sea Hunter and Orca, as well as one Ford class aircraft carrier, three 
Virginia Class submarines and three Arleigh Burke Class destroyers.  
 
Driven by the Marine Corps Force 2025 capability investment strategy, we will continue to 
modernize the Marine Corps with a 21st Century Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) by 
focusing on six key priorities:   
  C2 in a degraded environment;  
  Long range and precision fires;  
  Operations in the Information Environment (OIE);  
  Air defense;  
  Protected mobility and enhanced maneuver; and  
  Logistics.   
 
6 
 
This budget invests in Networking on the Move (NOTM) capabilities, close combat equipment, 
loitering munitions, unmanned logistic systems, ground-based anti-ship missiles, Ground/Air 
Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR), the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, and the Amphibious Combat 
Vehicle to ensure the Marine Corps continues to adapt to meet the demands of the future 
operating environment and maintain our competitive advantage.    
 
We will operate with data-informed end to end processes and incorporate leading practices to 
inform how we fight. To achieve the Secretary’s goal of 80% mission capable aircraft in our 
Fleet Strike Fighter squadrons, this budget funds the Fleet Readiness Centers (FRCs) to the 
maximum executable levels, realigns investments to spares, aviation engineering and logistics 
support, while pursuing reforms such as the Navy Sustainment System, which incorporates best 
practices from commercial airline maintenance leaders. We will also incorporate the lessons of 
private industry as we invest in shipyard infrastructure and training to improve performance and 
throughput.  
 
These are just a few examples of how General Neller, Admiral Richardson, the entire Navy 
Marine Corps Team and I are building on the foundation of restored readiness and increasing 
lethality. We will continue to promote a culture of problem solving at every level, transform 
from a culture of risk removal to one of understanding and managing risk, and hold ourselves 
accountable for how and where we invest. Every day, we work with a sense of urgency driven by 
the knowledge that the American taxpayers provide us with their hard-earned treasure, and trust 
us to protect them from a dangerous world. We owe it to them to ensure that every dollar is 
7 
 
invested in the most effective manner possible to fulfill our sacred oath. I’m proud to work with 
this committee to ensure that we keep that promise. Thank you.

Principal Deputy Director, Indian Health Service 
U. S. Department of Health and Human Services 
 
Before the 
 
United States Senate 
Committee on Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies 
 
Appropriations Hearing on 
The President’s FY 2020 Budget Request for the 
Indian Health Service 
 
 
May 1, 2019 
   
Good morning Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Udall and members of the 
Subcommittee. I am Rear Admiral Michael Weahkee, Principal Deputy Director of the Indian 
Health Service (IHS). Thank you for your support and for the opportunity to testify on the 
President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget.  The Budget advances our mission to raise the 
physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) 
to the highest level.  As an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, the 
IHS provides federal health services to approximately 2.6 million AI/AN from 573 federally 
recognized tribes in 37 states, through a network of over 605 hospitals, clinics and health 
stations. 
 
The President’s FY 2020 Budget proposes $5.9 billion in total for IHS, which is $392 million 
above the FY 2019 annualized continuing resolution funding level, or $140 million above the 
FY 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act.  The President’s Budget grows the resources 
available to meet the nation’s commitment to AI/AN in a constrained budget environment, 
reflecting a strong commitment to Indian Country. Specifically, the budget prioritizes direct 
clinical health care, providing a 7 percent increase and makes crucial investments in the fight 
against Hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS, launches a national expansion of our health paraprofessional 
program and provides resources for planning and key infrastructure improvements for a 
replacement electronic health record system (EHR).  The Budget also proposes to extend our 
successful Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) through FY 2021, at $150 million per 
year. 
 
The President’s Budget provides $25 million to expand partnerships between IHS and Native 
communities to eliminate Hepatitis C and end the HIV epidemic in Indian Country.  With the 
resources and tools we have available today, we have an unprecedented opportunity to make a 
real difference in reducing hepatitis and HIV transmission. I’m pleased that IHS is taking part in 
the “Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America” initiative. 
 
The Budget also provides $25 million to begin transition to a new and modernized replacement 
of IHS’s electronic health record system, Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS).  
These resources are critical to allow IHS to conduct planning for this transition and address key 
infrastructure gaps necessary to implement a modern EHR.  Our current system exists as more 
than 400 separate local instances rather than a single system, hobbling our efforts to share 
medical information efficiently, improve monitoring of medical quality, and recover critical third 
party financial resources. 
 
A modern system would enable IHS to enhance medical quality, maximize the time our doctors, 
nurses and other health professionals are providing direct patient care, and increase the security 
of our patients’ medical records.  I believe this transition represents an opportunity to 
meaningfully impact the care received by our patients. 
 
We have also requested $20 million to launch a national expansion of our paraprofessional 
program, the Community Health Aide Program (CHAP).  This program of certified health, 
behavioral health, and dental aides will enable us to fill critical care gaps.  This program has 
been used for decades in Alaska to great success and I believe its expansion into the rest of the 
2 
 
country will be beneficial and an important tool in meeting the health needs of AI/ANs, as part of 
a mix of services determined at the local level. 
 
In addition to these key initiatives, our FY 2020 Budget includes: 
  $147 million to expand direct clinical health services, including dental, mental health, 
alcohol and substance abuse services; 
  $8 million to recruit and retain medical professionals, critical to addressing gaps in care; 
  $2 million to bolster the Office of Quality; 
  $11 million to fund the health care of six newly federally recognized tribes; 
  $98 million to fully fund staffing at four newly completed or expanded health care 
facilities, including 3 joint venture facilities and a youth regional treatment center; 
  $69 million to support current services, including pay costs, inflation, and population 
growth; 
  $855 million for Contract Support Costs, which currently aligns with our estimate of 
those costs. 
 
The Budget prioritizes funding for key investments in support of direct clinical health services, 
and in doing so proposes some program adjustments.  A net reduction of $66 million in Facilities 
ensures continued priority focus on maintaining existing facilities and addressing continuing 
sanitation facilities construction projects.  Phase out of funding for the CHR program is 
contemplated with a funding level of $24 million, as part of proposed reforms to current 
community-based care.  The President’s Budget also proposes two program discontinuations, 
including the Health Education and Tribal Management Grants programs, which total 
$23 million. 
 
The Budget will enable us to implement our newly released Indian Health Service Strategic Plan 
for fiscal year 2019-2023.  The Strategic Plan will improve the management and administration 
of the IHS and sets the strategic direction of the agency over the next five years. The Strategic 
Plan includes three goals that will guide our efforts – access to care, quality of care, and 
strengthening management and operations. The final plan is the result of collaboration with our 
tribal and urban Indian organization partners who offered their feedback and expertise. 
 
Aligning with the IHS Strategic Plan, four legislative proposals are included within the Budget to 
increase access to care by: providing tax exemption for IHS scholarship and loan repayment 
programs, providing discretionary use of all Title 38 personnel authorities, meeting loan 
repayment and scholarship service obligations on a half-time basis, and providing Federal Tort 
Claim Act coverage for IHS volunteers.  These proposals focus on parity with authorities 
provided to other federal agencies providing health care services and seek to strengthen agency 
efforts to recruit and retain healthcare professionals.   
 
The IHS has also realized significant improvements to quality care for AI/ANs, including: 
  Establishing the Office of Quality as an elevated national oversight component within 
IHS Headquarters; 
  Implementing a new standardized professional provider credentialing and privileging 
software agency-wide for all applicants; 
3 
 
  Awarding a new contract for an adverse events reporting and tracking system that 
replaces an older legacy system. 
 
I can also report to you that since October 2018, 16 IHS health care facilities have had surveys 
by either the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Joint Commission (TJC) or 
the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC).  All surveys have resulted 
in CMS certification or TJC and AAAHC accreditation.  This includes both Rosebud and Rapid 
City hospitals, and the IHS is preparing to send a request to CMS for a certification of the Pine 
Ridge Hospital. 
 
Lastly, I want to take this opportunity to talk about an important issue to all of us at the IHS. 
Regarding the recent media reports on patient abuse by a former IHS employee, we have taken 
every opportunity to speak with our tribal and urban partners, as well as our federal employees, 
about how this conduct is unacceptable and will absolutely not be tolerated at IHS. 
 
Recently, I met with the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, to discuss 
steps IHS has taken to ensure the protection of patients at IHS health care facilities. I expressed 
my sincere regret that children were victimized by those entrusted to care for them and have 
made it absolutely clear that IHS will not tolerate sexual assault and abuse in its facilities. 
 
This opportunity followed a similar meeting I had in February with the Blackfeet Nation in 
Montana. These two communities were victimized by the actions of the former IHS employee. I 
want to thank the leadership of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Blackfeet Nation for their 
partnership as we work to re-establish trust with our patients. 
 
As shared in my October 2018 letter to tribal leaders, I can promise you that IHS will continue 
our efforts to ensure safe and quality care for our patients. We are committed to doing whatever 
it takes and will continue to work closely with our tribal and urban Indian partners in 
transforming health care for AI/ANs across the Country.  Some of the actions I have already 
taken include implementing new professional standards and stronger requirements for IHS 
employees to report suspected sexual abuse and exploitation of children.  The implementation of 
our new centralized credentialing system will enable us to monitor the practice history of 
licensed health care professionals across the agency. 
 
The Presidential Task Force on Protecting Native American Children in the Indian Health 
Service System announced in March will complement our ongoing efforts to identify areas for 
improvement and implement changes to strengthen our systems. IHS is in the process of 
identifying an outside, independent contractor to conduct a medical quality assurance review to 
examine whether laws, policies and procedures have been followed, and to identify any further 
improvements IHS can implement to better protect patients. The HHS Office of the Inspector 
General has also been tasked with reviewing the effectiveness of the actions we have taken. 
 
I assure you that our workforce understands how serious this issue is, and I am proud of the 
efforts and commitment of our staff for the progress we’ve made, and we continue to press 
forward.  We remain firmly committed to improving quality, safety, and access to health care for 
AI/AN, in collaboration with our partners in HHS, across Indian country, and Congress. We 
4 
 
appreciate all your efforts in helping us provide the best possible health care services to the 
people we serve. 
 
Thank you, and I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

Written Statement of Administrator Mark Green, U.S. Agency for International 
Development (USAID) 
Senate Appropriations Committee 
Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs 
April 30th, 2019 
 
Introduction 
Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Leahy, Members of the Committee, thank you for this 
opportunity to discuss the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget Request for USAID. 
The FY 2020 request for USAID fully and partially managed accounts is approximately $19.2 
billion, an increase of $2.4 billion, or 14 percent, over last year’s request. It requests $6.3 billion 
for global health and $5.2 billion for the Economic Support and Development Fund. In terms of 
USAID’s humanitarian assistance, it requests $6 billion for the new International Humanitarian 
Assistance Account, which, combined with all available resources, will allow us to maintain the 
highest level ever of U.S. humanitarian assistance programming 
** 
USAID remains focused on our core day-to-day work: helping support the world’s most-
vulnerable populations affected by humanitarian crises; promoting human rights, democracy, and 
citizen-responsive governance; and improving development outcomes in the areas of economic 
growth, education, environment, and health worldwide. Every day, our highly professional and 
dedicated staff work diligently to deliver sustainable development solutions and build self-
reliance in partner countries, project American values globally, and advance our foreign-policy 
and national-security objectives. 
I know that I cannot touch upon our work in each country in the limited time afforded me today, 
so allow me to discuss some of the themes and situations at the forefront of our attention. 
Optimizing Humanitarian Assistance 
The budget request reaffirms that Americans will always stand with people and countries when 
disaster strikes or crisis emerges. The FY 2020 U.S. humanitarian request will provide an 
average of $9 billion in both FY 2019 and FY 2020 when combined with all available resources, 
allowing the U.S. to remain the single largest global donor and maintain roughly the highest 
level ever of USG humanitarian assistance programming. The United States will not only 
continue our role as the world leader in humanitarian assistance, but we will also call on others to 
do their part and we will work relentlessly to assure that assistance is delivered as effectively and 
efficiently as possible. 
Over the years, the responsibilities of the two USAID offices that lead the bulk of our 
humanitarian assistance—Food for Peace and the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance 
(OFDA)—have been sharply increasing. While they have often coordinated, they have worked in 
parallel, with separate budgets, separate oversight, separate structures, and different strategies. 
Our overseas humanitarian assistance, within USAID’s new Bureau for Humanitarian 
Assistance, supports this Administration’s commitment to optimize USAID humanitarian 
investments. This will ensure a seamless blend of food and non-food humanitarian USAID 
assistance, better serving our foreign policy interests and people in need. 
The budget also delivers on the President’s commitment to optimize the effectiveness of the U.S. 
Government’s outdated and fragmented overseas humanitarian assistance. The proposal 
maximizes the impact of taxpayer dollars, helps more beneficiaries, and delivers the greatest 
outcomes to them by consolidating all overseas humanitarian programming in the new Bureau at 
USAID while retaining State’s lead role on humanitarian policy issues, as well as the U.S. 
refugee-admissions program. 
Venezuela 
Nowhere is America’s leadership in humanitarian assistance more important, or more timely, 
than in our continued response to the man-made, regime-driven crisis in Venezuela. As you 
know, the illegitimate dictator Nicolas Maduro has repeatedly blocked outside efforts to provide 
humanitarian relief to the millions of Venezuelan citizens in need. We continue to monitor the 
situation in Venezuela closely, where Maduro and his cronies have destroyed the country's 
institutions and economy, and created the largest cross-border mass exodus in the history of the 
Americas. Venezuelans could soon become one of the largest groups of displaced people in the 
world. 
In response to Interim President Juan Guaidó’s request for assistance that could help him meet 
some of his people’s urgent needs, USAID and State —with support from the Departments of 
Defense and others— have pre-positioned humanitarian assistance close to the Venezuelan 
border with  Colombia, and Brazil. USAID has also pre-positioned humanitarian assistance 
inside of the island of Curacao, for eventual delivery into Venezuela. Since February 4, the U.S. 
Government has pre-positioned nearly 546 metric tons of urgently needed humanitarian 
assistance, including food aid, emergency medical items, hygiene kits, non-pharmaceutical 
commodities, water treatment units, and nutrition products. 
At President Trump’s instruction, we have closely coordinated these efforts with the 
international community. President Iván Duque of Colombia and President Jair Bolsonaro of 
Brazil, in particular, have been key allies in our efforts. The United States is grateful for our 
allies in the region who have stepped up to help the Venezuelan people in their hour of need. 
We will continue to support Interim President Guaidó’s efforts to deliver aid to his people in 
Venezuela, and also continue to help Colombia and other countries that are hosting Venezuelans 
who have fled. To date, the U.S. has provided more than $213 million in humanitarian assistance 
and approximately $43 million in development assistance for Venezuelans and host communities 
in the region. That funding has brought urgently needed food, health care, protection, and shelter, 
to both Venezuelans and host communities. USAID also funds local organizations involved with 
human rights, civil society, independent media, electoral oversight, and democratic political 
processes, and the democratically elected National Assembly. We are not alone in this effort. 
Many of our close allies have pledged support, and many private citizens have already 
contributed assistance to Venezuelans in the region, as well. 
The United States stands with those who are yearning for a better life and a true democracy. We 
know the answer to Venezuela’s crisis must be human liberty and democracy; Venezuelans 
deserve a return to democracy, rule of law, and citizen-responsive governance. 
We also stand with the Cuban people who have suffered for six decades under an authoritarian 
regime – the same regime plays a crucial and destabilizing role in supporting Maduro and his 
cronies. The United States funds democracy programs that help the capacity of independent 
Cuban civil society, support the free flow of uncensored information to and from the island, and 
provide humanitarian assistance to political prisoners and their families. 
In response to requests by Cuban civil-society activities during the Summit of the Americas in 
April 2018, USAID identified an additional $750,000 in FY 2017 funds to increase humanitarian 
support for Cuban political prisoners and their families, and to provide additional 
communications tools to civil society activists. 
Tropical Cyclone Idai 
USAID mobilized quickly in response to the devastating impact of Tropical Cyclone Idai on 
Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi. 
Torrential rains covered nearly 900 square miles of land in water—that’s an area larger than New 
York City and Los Angeles combined. Sadly, more than 600 people lost their lives, and 1.85 
million people are in desperate need of assistance. 
USAID deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), which includes experts in 
health, food security, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene to provide technical advice and 
make assessments in real time. To prevent the spread of cholera and other waterborne diseases, 
USAID delivered  relief supplies, including water-treatment units, water- storage containers, and 
latrines, and is working with partners to provide medication and oral rehydration salts. To reach 
the communities cut off by the storm, we also requested the unique capabilities of the U.S. 
Department of Defense U.S. Africa Command to provide airlift and logistics support for our 
humanitarian response. Over the course of their mission, the U.S. military flew 73 flights, and 
transported more than 782 metric tons of relief supplies, including food, medical supplies, and 
vehicles, as well as USAID disaster experts and aid workers. 
Outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) 
Since the declaration of the outbreak on August 1, 2018, health officials have recorded at least 
1,353 confirmed and probable cases, including 880 deaths, in DRC’s North Kivu and Ituri 
Provinces as of April 23, 2019. The U.S. Government deployed a DART to the DRC to augment 
the ongoing Ebola response efforts. These disaster and health experts from USAID and the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS), are working with partners to provide robust life-saving assistance and 
support affected populations. The DART is coordinating with the DRC Ministry of Health, the 
World Health Organization, other donors, and key actors to support a unified effort, encourage 
sustained resourcing and fair burden-sharing, and ultimately end the outbreak. USAID assistance 
works to break the chain of transmission, including through preventing and controlling 
infections, surveillance and case-finding, contact-tracing, case-management, and raising 
awareness in communities about how the virus is transmitted. 
This response is a priority for the U.S. Government, not only because we are committed to 
supporting those affected, but also because effective efforts to contain and end the outbreak will 
prevent it from spreading throughout the broader region and beyond, including the United States. 
I remain concerned that the outbreak is still not contained, however, and am working with 
colleagues in the interagency to advocate for a more effective global response. 
Rohingya Crisis in Bangladesh and Burma 
Bangladesh now hosts one million Rohingya refugees from Burma in the world’s largest refugee 
camp. Over 740,000 of these refugees arrived in the wake of an ethnic cleansing campaign 
conducted by Burmese security forces that began in August 2017. Last May, I went to 
Bangladesh and Burma’s Rakhine State to observe firsthand the daily burdens and suffering 
facing Rohingya communities. In many ways, it is the harshest situation I have seen in my time 
at USAID. The United States is the largest single donor of humanitarian aid to this crisis, and 
stands as a beacon of hope to Rohingya. 
Our efforts continue to focus on measures that will improve the situation for Rohingya in 
Rakhine State, as well as Rohingya refugees and host communities in Bangladesh. While 
providing life-saving assistance is critical, we also undertake programming to encourage the 
Burmese Government to address the underlying causes of tension and violence, which are 
essential for lasting justice. This is a necessary step if that beautiful country is to fulfill the 
promise of its far-from-fully-realized democratic transition. 
Yemen 
We also remain seriously concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, which is the 
world’s largest in terms of affected population.  Approximately 80 percent of the country—more 
than 24 million people—require some form of humanitarian assistance. More than 3.6 million 
people have already been displaced; there have been more than 1.6 million suspected cases of 
cholera in the last two years, and nearly five million people are one step away from famine.  
Since FY 2018, the United States has provided nearly $721 million in humanitarian aid to 
Yemen, and USAID is responsible for nearly $692 million of that assistance.     
Support for Religious and Ethnic Minorities 
The $150 million in USAID and State Department funding this Budget requests will help us 
continue our important assistance to those religious and ethnic minorities in the Middle East, and 
other regions, whom ISIS sought to extinguish. We believe freedom of religion and conscience 
are an essential part of our national character, and an essential attribute of any country that seeks 
to be prosperous, democratic, and just.   
As evidenced by the heinous attacks in Sri Lanka on Easter morning, religious intolerance is far 
from limited to the Middle East.  The bombings that took the lives of so many, including four 
U.S. citizens, are a painful reminder that we must remain vigilant against this scourge.  USAID 
extends its deepest condolences to the friends and families of those lost in the attacks, and we 
will continue our efforts to promote interfaith dialogue and peaceful co-existence in our work 
across the world.    
Democratic Backsliding 
Another significant challenge we face in many regions is democratic backsliding. Rarely these 
days do authoritarian leaders oppose elections outright. Instead, as we have seen in capitals from 
Caracas to Phnom Penh, they use sophisticated tools and methods to bend elections to ensure 
they can maintain their grip on power. Subverting civil society and independent media, 
manipulating vote tabulations, and other anti-democratic ploys are all too often undermining 
hope for everyday citizens to be able to shape their future through the ballot box. USAID will 
continue to fund programming that aims to counter authoritarian impulses, nurture the capacity 
of civil society to advocate for an agenda of liberty, and advance fundamental freedoms 
worldwide. 
Many parts of the world have seen an exponential growth of predatory financing dressed up as 
development assistance. China and Russia have been by far the greatest, though not the sole, 
sources of such financing. This form of financing often leads to unsustainable debt, eroded 
national sovereignty, and even the forfeiture of strategic resources and assets. 
As part of an Agency-wide strategic approach, USAID will soon unveil a Framework to help us 
counter malign Kremlin influence, especially in Europe and Eurasia. This budget request 
prioritizes $584 million in State Department and USAID foreign assistance to support that work 
and our efforts to aggressively communicate the stark differences between authoritarian 
financing tools and the approach that we and our allied donor nations use. 
Our approach is true assistance that helps partner nations build their own self-reliance and a 
more dynamic, private enterprise-driven future. We aim to help partner countries recognize the 
costs of alternative models, like those of China and Russia, that can weaken confidence in 
democratic and free-market systems, saddle countries with unsustainable debt, erode 
sovereignty, lead to the forfeiture of strategic assets ignore the needs and concerns of local 
communities, and further the militaristic ambitions of authoritarian actors.   
One positive story in our work, both in terms of supporting democratic processes and countering 
malign Kremlin influence, is in Ukraine.  USAID provided support to the Central Election 
Commission in the lead up to the recent Presidential elections. According to the most trusted 
international and domestic monitoring organizations, the election was conducted peacefully and 
without significant external manipulation—representing the true will of Ukraine’s citizens.  We 
look forward to working with President Elect Zelenskiy to continue strengthening democratic 
processes in the country, rooting out corruption, empowering civil society, building a stronger 
basis for sustained prosperity, and enhancing resilience to malign Kremlin influence.  
Indo-Pacific Strategy 
America’s security and prosperity at home is closely tied to a stable and free Indo-Pacific 
Region, and this request includes over $1.2 billion in State Department and USAID foreign 
assistance to protect U.S. interests and promote open, transparent, and citizen-responsive 
governance across the Indo-Pacific. 
In Asia, USAID plays a key role in advancing the U.S. Government’s Indo-Pacific Strategy 
(IPS), particularly the economic and governance pillars, and the latter’s headlining Transparency 
Initiative. America’s vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region is one in which all nations are 
sovereign, strong, and prosperous. Together with our U.S. Government partners, and in 
coordination with like-minded donor partners, USAID helps advance the IPS by strengthening 
governance in areas critical to achieving this vision—primarily with regard to bolstering 
economies and free markets, supporting democratic institutions and transparency promoting 
human rights and empowered citizens, and fostering incentives that address the region’s 
substantial infrastructure gaps —foremost in the energy, transportation, and digital connectivity 
sectors. By promoting open, transparent, rules-based, and citizen-responsive governance across 
Asia, the IPS mitigates the influence of predatory countries while unlocking private-sector-led 
growth that helps drive sustainable development and increase partner countries’ self-reliance. As 
part of this strategy, USAID is playing a leading role in the interagency. 
** 
At USAID, we are proud of our role as the world’s premier development agency. We are just as 
dedicated to ensuring that we maintain that leadership role in the years ahead. To prepare 
ourselves for the future, in late 2017, we initiated a series of interconnected reforms we call 
Transformation. Aimed at shaping a USAID that remains worthy of both American investments  
and the talented, dedicated staff who work for us around the world, Transformation will allow us 
to strengthen our core capabilities, increase efficiency, and ultimately, improve outcomes while 
reducing costs. This Budget Request closely aligns with, and supports, the implementation of 
these plans. 
When I last appeared before this Committee on April 24, 2018, I provided an overview of several 
planned initiatives in our Transformation framework. After nearly 100 consultations with many 
of you, your staff, and colleagues across Capitol Hill, we have since launched our reform agenda 
and submitted nine Congressional Notifications related to the Agency’s new structure. Our 
structure is closely tied to other internal reforms, and will provide the necessary enabling 
environment, within USAID, to ensure this vision takes root. I ask for your support for clearing 
the remaining Congressional Notifications on our Transformation, and am eager to answer any 
questions you might have. 
Country Roadmaps: Defining and Measuring Self-Reliance 
In pursuit of our vision of a day when development assistance is no longer needed, we are now 
orienting our work around the concept of fostering self-reliance in partner countries. USAID 
defines “self-reliance” as a country’s ability to plan, finance, and implement solutions to its own 
development challenges. To understand where a country is going in its Journey to Self-Reliance, 
we need to understand where they are on that journey and how far they have come from. To that 
end, and after consultations with USAID employees, external partners and other shareholders, 
we pulled together 17 objective, third-party metrics across the political, economic, and social 
spheres. They fall into two broad categories: commitment, or the degree to which a country’s 
laws, policies, actions, and formal and informal governance mechanisms support progress toward 
self-reliance; and capacity, which refers to how far a country has come in its ability to plan, 
finance, and manage its own development agenda. 
We then assembled these metrics, country-by-country, as “Country Roadmaps” for all 136 low- 
and middle-income countries as classified by the World Bank. We rolled out Roadmaps in 
August 2018 for socialization with partner governments. 
These Roadmaps serve several purposes. First, again, they help us identify approximately where 
each country is in its development journey, a crucial first step in orienting our in-country 
approach around the concept of self-reliance. Second, they help inform our strategic decision-
making and resource allocation processes and ensure we better focus USAID’s investments. As 
we better align our strategies and our budgets, we look forward to working with you, and your 
colleagues, to ensure we have the appropriate mix of resource allocations. Third, because they 
use objective, open-source data, the Roadmaps provide USAID with a common touchstone for 
use in dialogues with countries and development partners. Fourth, the metrics help signal to 
USAID—and the broader U.S. Government—when a country has made enough development 
progress such that we should pursue a new, more enterprise-centered phase in our partnership. 
In October 2018, we published the Country Roadmaps online at USAID.gov. I welcome you to 
take a look. 
Diversifying Our Partner Base, and Engaging New and Underutilized Partners 
Metrics provide us with critical insight, but, ultimately, it is our in-country partnerships that 
advance our mission. Tapping into the innovation and resources of the private sector, and 
working with a full breadth of stakeholders, is critical to achieving sustainable development 
outcomes and building self-reliance. Many local and locally established actors—such as 
education institutions, non-profits, faith-based organizations and for-profit enterprises—have 
long engaged in their own efforts to build capacity, increase accountability, and provide services 
in countries prioritized by USAID. They are natural allies in our development mission, and this 
Request includes $20 million towards a New Partnerships Initiatives to expand our partner base. 
Historically, these groups have often struggled to compete for USAID funding because of 
burdensome compliance and solicitation requirements, the imposing dollar size and scope of our 
awards, and unfamiliarity with USAID’s terminology and practices. On our end, we have 
admittedly lacked a sustained commitment to mobilizing new and local partners. The result has 
been a dwindling partner base. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, 60 percent of our obligations went to 
25 partners, and more than 80 percent of our obligations went to just 75 partners. The number of 
new partners has decreased consistently since 2011. 
With the launch of USAID’s first-ever Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) Strategy last 
December, we seek to reverse this trend, and tap into the good ideas and innovative approaches 
we know exist in underutilized partners. Included in the core tenets of our Strategy are more 
collaborative approaches to partnership, prioritizing innovation, and building the commitment 
and capacity of new partners. By diversifying our partner-base, we will not only incorporate new 
ideas and approaches into our tool-kit, but we will also strengthen locally led development—a 
core component of each country’s Journey to Self-Reliance. 
Strengthening Private-Sector Engagement 
While there will always be an important role for traditional contracting and grant-making in our 
work, we can accelerate and amplify our efforts and outcomes by increasingly applying market-
based solutions to the development challenges we aim to address. At USAID, we have long 
recognized that private enterprise is the most-powerful force on earth for lifting lives out of 
poverty, strengthening communities, and building self-reliance. But until recently, the Agency 
lacked a formal, overarching policy to guide and galvanize our engagement with the private-
sector. 
That changed last December with the launch of USAID’s Private-Sector Engagement Policy. 
The Policy serves as a call to action for all Agency staff and partners to increase and strengthen 
our work with commercial firms, and embrace market-based approaches to achieve outcomes. 
We seek ever-greater input from the private-sector to move beyond mere contracts and grants to 
include more true collaboration—co-design, co-creation, and co-financing. 
As part of this greater focus on private-sector engagement, USAID looks forward to a close 
partnership with the new Development Finance Corporation (DFC) established by the BUILD 
Act to mobilize financing, and this Request provides $50 million towards the new DFC. With 
close integration of tools such as the Development Credit Authority (DCA), the Overseas Private 
Investment Corporation (OPIC), new equity authority and other reforms, the DFC will make 
private-sector engagement much more effective. We are working closely with OPIC and the 
White House to make the new DFC a reality. Through collaborative endeavors with our United 
States Government partners and the private sector, we seek to join up our respective expertise to 
tackle problems that neither could fully address alone. 
We pursue greater engagement with the private sector because it is sound development, it 
achieves better outcomes, and it leverages the vast, largely untapped resources of commercial 
enterprise throughout the world. But we also pursue it because it is good for American 
businesses. The world’s fastest-growing economies are largely in the developing world. 
USAID’s work to promote regulatory reform already helps level the playing field for American 
businesses, by reducing their barrier to entry in these large markets. Combined with financing 
support from the new DFC, the United States can help bring these American businesses directly 
to the table to tackle specific challenges and further expand their opportunities. 
This renewed emphasis on private sector engagement has already borne fruit. For example, last 
November, I signed a Memorandum of Understanding between USAID and Corteva, one of 
America’s great agribusinesses. Together, we will tackle global hunger while simultaneously 
cultivating new markets for U.S. technology and expertise. I am excited to see what other 
partnerships emerge in the months and years ahead. 
Women’s Economic Empowerment 
No country can meaningfully progress in the Journey to Self-Reliance if it shuns half its 
population. The development dividends of greater participation by women in the economy are 
numerous. Our experience shows that investing in women and girls accelerates gains across the 
full development spectrum, from preventing conflict to improving food security and economic 
opportunity. 
The President's National Security Strategy clearly recognizes women’s empowerment as a top 
foreign policy priority. On February 7, 2019, President Trump launched the Women’s Global 
Development and Prosperity (W-GDP), and signed a Presidential Security Memorandum that 
clearly and decisively links the ability of women to participate fully and freely in the economy 
with greater peace and prosperity across the world. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, we allocated $50 
million for W-GDP. This year’s request goes further, and includes $100 million to support 
workforce-development and skills-training, greater access to capital, and changes to the enabling 
environment so that, around the world, all women have greater opportunities to reach their full 
economic potential. 
Staffing 
At USAID, our human resources are our most precious asset. Our professional, experienced, and 
dedicated corps of Foreign Service Officers (FSOs) are at the frontlines of what we do as an 
Agency. In recognition of that, USAID will continue to staff up and bring our Foreign Service 
workforce into greater alignment with strategic planning numbers and our available Operating 
Expense budget. Specifically, we are seeking to expand our overseas Foreign Service capability 
to better manage financial risk, increase program oversight, provide critical support for the 
President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and fill technical positions that have 
been chronically short-staffed. USAID has also selected 10 finalists for the 2019 Payne 
Fellowship program. 
USAID is preparing to hire approximately 140 career-track FSOs between now and the end of 
FY 2020. Hiring 140 FSOs over the next two fiscal years and adjusting for attrition would bring 
the total FSO workforce by the end of FY 2020 to just over 1,700 FSOs. For USAID’s Civil 
Service, USAID’s Hiring Review and Reassignment Board, has approved the hiring of an 
additional 221 staff to be added to the General Schedule workforce, which stood at 1,181 U.S. 
Direct Hires (USDH) as of February 2019.   
To support USAID’s mission, we seek to test a non-career, term-limited personnel system that is 
more efficient and flexible than our current systems while also better for many program-funded 
staff, by improving benefits and professional development. Within this budget proposal, USAID 
is also requesting to pilot an Adaptive Personnel Project (APP) to develop an agile, non-
career/at-will U.S Direct Hire personnel system that can rapidly hire, move, and retain a talented, 
program-funded workforce. APP would be a program-funded, direct-hire mechanism with 
Federal benefits and inherently governmental authorities. The overall vision is to improve 
USAID’s ability to hire the right talent, at the right time, in the right place, for the right duration 
of time. 
 
Conclusion 
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the Committee, I believe we are shaping an 
Agency that is capable of leveraging our influence, authority, and available resources to advance 
U.S. interests, transform the way we provide humanitarian and development assistance, and, 
alongside the rest of the world, meet the daunting challenges we all see today. With your support 
and guidance, we will ensure USAID remains the world’s premier international development 
Agency and continues the important work we do, each day, to protect America’s future security 
and prosperity. 
Thank you for allowing me to speak with you today, and I welcome your questions.

 STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE ROBERT L. WILKIE 
SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 
 
FOR PRESENTATION BEFORE THE 
SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, VETERANS AFFAIRS,  
AND RELATED AGENCIES 
 
BUDGET REQUEST FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020 
APRIL 30, 2019 
Good afternoon, Chairman Boozman, Senator Schatz, and distinguished 
Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today in support 
of the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA), including the FY 2021 Advance Appropriation (AA) request. I am accompanied 
today by Dr. Richard Stone, Executive in Charge, Veterans Health Administration 
(VHA), Dr. Paul Lawrence, Under Secretary for Benefits, Randy Reeves, Under 
Secretary for Memorial Affairs, and Jon Rychalski, Assistant Secretary for Management 
and Chief Financial Officer.   
I begin by thanking Congress and this Subcommittee for your continued strong 
support and shared commitment to our Nation’s Veterans VA. In my estimation, two 
Federal Government departments must rise above partisan politics—the Department of 
Defense (DoD) and VA. The bipartisan support this Subcommittee provides sustains 
that proposition. To continue VA’s momentum, the FY 2020 budget request fulfills the 
President’s strong commitment to Veterans by providing the resources necessary to 
improve the care and support our Veterans have earned through sacrifice and service to 
our country. 
Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget Request 
The President’s FY 2020 Budget requests $220.2 billion for VA — $97.0 billion in 
discretionary funding (including medical care collections). The discretionary request is 
an increase of $6.8 billion, or 7.5 percent, over the enacted FY 2019 budget. It will 
sustain the progress we have made and provide additional resources to improve patient 
access and timeliness of medical care services for the approximately 9 million enrolled 
Veterans eligible for VA health care, while improving benefits delivery for our Veterans 
and their beneficiaries. The President’s FY 2020 budget also requests $123.2 billion in 
mandatory funding, $12.3 billion or 11.1 percent above 2019. 
For the FY 2021 AA, the budget requests $91.8 billion in discretionary funding 
including medical care collections for Medical Care and $129.5 billion in mandatory 
advance appropriations for Compensation and Pensions, Readjustment Benefits, and 
Veterans Insurance and Indemnities benefits programs in the Veterans Benefits 
Administration (VBA). 
1 
 
 
For VA Medical Care, VA is requesting $84.1 billion (including collections) in FY 
2020, a 9.6 percent increase over the 2019 level, and a $4.6 billion increase over the 
2020 AA, primarily for community care and to transition the Choice Program workload to 
VA’s discretionary Medical Community Care account. This Budget will provide funding 
for treating 7.1 million patients in 2020. 
This is a strong budget request that fulfills the President’s commitment to 
Veterans by ensuring that they receive high-quality health care and timely access to 
benefits and services while concurrently improving productivity and fiscal responsibility. 
I urge Congress to support and fully fund our FY 2020 and FY 2021 AA budget requests 
– these resources are critical to enabling the Department to meet the evolving needs of 
our Veterans and successfully execute my top priorities.   
Customer Service  
It is the responsibility of all VA employees to provide an excellent customer 
service experience (CX) to Veterans, Servicemembers, their families, caregivers, and 
survivors when we deliver care, benefits, and memorial services. I am privileged to 
champion this effort. 
Our National Cemetery Administration has long been recognized as the 
organization with the highest customer satisfaction score in the Nation. That’s according 
to the American Customer Satisfaction Index ACSI). And that’s across all sectors of 
industry and government. We need to work to scope that kind of success across all 
benefits and services. 
That’s why I incorporated CX into the FY 2018-2024 VA Strategic Plan. Last 
year, I issued VA’s first customer service policy. That policy outlines how VA will 
achieve excellent customer service along three key pillars: CX Capabilities, CX 
Governance, and CX Accountability. I am holding all VA executives, managers, 
supervisors, and employees accountable to foster a climate of customer service 
excellence. We will be guided by our core VA Values of Integrity, Commitment, 
Advocacy, Respect, and Excellence (I-CARE). These values define our culture of 
customer service and help shape our standards of behavior. 
Because of VA’s leadership in customer experience, our Veterans Experience 
Office has been designated Lead Agency Partner for the President’s Management 
Agenda (PMA) Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal on Improving Customer Experience 
across government.  
Our goal is to lead the President’s work of improving customer experience across 
Federal agencies and deliver customer service to Veterans we serve that is on par with 
top private sector companies.  
This is not business as usual at VA. We are changing our culture and putting our 
Veteran customers at the center of our process. To accomplish this goal, we are making 
investments in Customer Service, and we are making bold moves in training and 
implementing customer experience best practices. 
2 
 
 
 
Veterans Experience Office. The Veterans Experience Office (VEO) is my lead 
organization for achieving our customer service priority and providing the Department a 
core customer experience capability. VEO offers four core customer experience 
capabilities, including real-time customer experience data, tangible customer 
experience tools, modern technology, and targeted engagement. For FY 2020, VEO is 
shifting from a full reimbursable authority (RA) funding model to a hybrid of a RA and 
budget authority (BA) model. The FY 2020 request of $69.4 million for the VEO ($8.6 
million in BA and $60.6 million in RA) is $8.1 million above the FY 2019 enacted budget. 
The budget increase and the transition to a BA highlights VA’s commitment to customer 
service and the institutionalization of CX capabilities within the Department to improve 
care, benefits and service to Veterans, their families, caregivers and survivors. 
MISSION Act Implementation  
The VA MISSION Act of 2018 (the MISSION Act) will fundamentally transform 
elements of VA’s health care system, fulfilling the President’s commitment to help 
Veterans live a healthy and fulfilling life. It is critical that we deliver a transformed 21st 
century VA health care system that puts Veterans at the center of everything we do. 
The FY 2020 budget requests $8.9 billion in the VA Medical Care program for 
implementation of key provisions of the MISSION Act:  $5.5 billion for continued care of 
the Choice Program population; $2.9 billion for expanded access for care based on 
average drive time and wait time standards and expanded transplant care; $272 million 
for the Urgent Care benefit, and $150 million to expand the Program of Comprehensive 
Assistance for Family Caregivers.  
Access to Care. Over the past few years, VA has invested heavily in our direct 
delivery system, leading to reduced wait times for care in VA facilities that currently 
meet or exceed the quality and timeliness of care provided by the private sector. And 
VA is improving access across its more than 1,200 facilities even as Veteran 
participation in VA health care continues to increase.   
From FY 2014 through FY 2018, VA saw an increase of 226,000 unique patients 
for outpatient appointments (a four percent increase). Since FY 2014, the number of 
annual appointments for VA care is up by 3.4 million. There were over 58 million 
appointments in VA facilities in FY 2018—620,000 more than the prior fiscal year. We 
have significantly reduced the time to complete an urgent referral to a specialist. In FY 
2014, it took an average of 19.3 days to complete an urgent referral and in FY 2018 it 
took 2.1 days, an 89 percent decrease. As of December 2018, that time was down to 
about 1.6 days. 
Still, our patchwork of multiple separate community care programs is a 
bureaucratic maze that is difficult for Veterans, their families, and VA employees to 
navigate.  
3 
 
 
The MISSION Act empowers VA to deliver the quality care and timely service 
Veterans deserve so we will remain at the center of Veterans’ care. Further, the 
MISSION Act strengthens VA’s internal network and infrastructure so VA can provide 
Veterans more health care access more efficiently.  
Transition to the New Community Care Program. We are building an integrated, 
holistic system of care that combines the best of VA, our Federal partners, academic 
affiliates, and the private sector.  
The Veterans Community Care Program consolidates VA’s separate community 
care programs and will put care in the hands of Veterans and get them the right care at 
the right time from the right provider. On January 30, 2019, we announced proposed 
access standards that would determine if Veterans are eligible for community care 
under the access standard eligibility criterion in the MISSION Act to supplement care 
they are provided in the VA health care system.  The proposed regulation for the 
program (RIN 2900-AQ46) was published in the Federal Register on February 22, 2019, 
and was open for comments through March 25, 2019. 
New Veterans Community Care Program Eligibility Criteria 
1.  VA does not offer the care or services the Veteran requires;  
2.  VA does not operate a full-service medical facility in the State in which the 
Veteran resides;  
3.  The Veteran was eligible to receive care under the Veterans Choice Program 
and is eligible to receive care under certain grandfathering provisions;  
4.  VA is not able to furnish care or services to a Veteran in a manner that complies 
with VA’s designated access standards;  
5.  The Veteran and the Veteran’s referring clinician determine it is in the best 
medical interest of the Veteran to receive care or services from an eligible entity 
or provider based on consideration of certain criteria that VA would establish; or 
6.  The Veteran is seeking care or services from a VA medical service line that VA 
has determined is not providing care that complies with VA’s standards for 
quality.   
Proposed Access Standards. VA’s proposed access standards—proposed for 
implementation in June 2019—best meet the medical needs of Veterans and will 
complement existing VA facilities with community providers to give Veterans access to 
health care.  
1.  For primary care, mental health, and non-institutional extended care services 
VA is proposing a 30-minute average drive time from the Veteran’s residence. 
4 
 
 
2.  For specialty care, VA is proposing a 60-minute average drive time from the 
Veteran’s residence.  
3.  VA is proposing appointment wait-time standards of 20 days for primary care, 
mental health care, and non-institutional extended care services and 28 days for 
specialty care from the date of request, unless a later date has been agreed to by 
the Veteran in consultation with the VA health care provider.  
  Primary/Mental  Specialty Care 
Health/Non-institutional 
Extended Care 
Appointment Wait Time  Within 20 Days  Within 28 Days 
Average Drive Time  Within 30 Min  Within 60 Min 
VA remains committed to providing care through VA facilities as the primary 
means for Veterans to receive health care, and it will remain the focus of VA’s efforts. 
As a complement to VA’s facilities eligible Veterans who cannot receive care within the 
requirements of these proposed access standards would be offered community care. 
When Veterans are eligible for community care, they may choose to receive care with 
an eligible community provider, or they may continue to choose to get the care at their 
VA medical facility. 
The proposed access standards are based on analysis of practices and our 
consultations with Federal agencies—including the DoD, the Department of Health and 
Human Services, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services—private sector 
organizations, and other non-governmental commercial entities. Practices in both the 
private and public sector formulated our proposed access standards to include 
appointment wait-time standards and average drive time standards.  
VA also published a Notice in the Federal Register seeking public comments, 
and in July 2018, VA held a public meeting to provide an additional opportunity for 
public comment.  
With VA’s proposed access standards, the future of VA’s health care system will 
lie in the hands of Veterans—exactly where it should be. 
Urgent Care. This budget will also invest $272 million in implementing the new 
urgent (walk-in care) benefit included in the VA MISSION Act.  On January 31, 2019, 
VA published a proposed rule that would guide the provision of this benefit using the 
provider network available through national contracts.  Under the new urgent care 
authority, we will be able to offer eligible Veterans convenient care for certain, limited, 
non-emergent health care needs.   
5 
 
 
Caregivers. The MISSION Act expands eligibility for VA’s Program of 
Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) under the Caregiver 
Support Program, establishes new benefits for designated primary family caregivers of 
eligible Veterans, and makes other changes affecting program eligibility and VA’s 
evaluation of PCAFC applications. Currently, the Program of Comprehensive 
Assistance for Family Caregivers is only available to eligible family caregivers of eligible 
Veterans who incurred or aggravated a serious injury in the line of duty on or after 
September 11, 2001. Implementation of the MISSION Act will expand eligibility to 
eligible family caregivers of eligible Veterans from all eras. 
Under the law, expansion will begin when VA certifies to Congress that VA has 
fully implemented a required information technology system. The expansion will occur in 
two phases beginning with eligible family caregivers of eligible Veterans who incurred or 
aggravated a serious injury in the line of duty on or before May 7, 1975, with further 
expansion beginning two years after that.  
Over the course of the next year, VA will be establishing systems and regulations 
necessary to expand this program. Caregivers and Veterans can learn about the full 
range of available support and programs through the Caregivers website, 
www.caregiver.va.gov, or by contacting the Caregiver Support Line toll-free at 1-855-
260-3274. 
The FY 2020 Budget for the Caregivers Support Program is $720 million, $150 
million of which is specifically requested to implement the program’s expansion because 
of the MISSION Act. 
Telehealth.  VA is a leader in providing telehealth services. VA leverages 
telehealth technologies to enhance the accessibility, capacity, and quality of VA health 
care for Veterans, their families, and their caregivers anywhere in the country. VA 
achieved more than one million video telehealth visits in FY 2018, a 19 percent increase 
in video telehealth visits over the prior year. Telehealth is a critical tool to ensure 
Veterans, especially rural Veterans, can access health care when and where they need 
it. With the support of Congress, VA has an opportunity to continue shaping the future of 
health care with cutting-edge technology providing convenient, accessible, high-quality 
care to Veterans. The FY 2020 Budget includes $1.1 billion for telehealth services, a 
$105 million or 10.5 percent increase over the 2019 current estimate.   
Section 151 of the MISSION Act strengthens VA’s ability to provide even more 
telehealth services because it statutorily authorizes VA providers to practice telehealth 
at any location in any State, regardless of where the provider is licensed. VA’s 
telehealth program enhances customer service by increasing Veterans’ access to VA 
care, while lessening travel burdens.  
In FY 2018, more than 782,000 Veterans (or 13 percent of Veterans obtaining 
care at VA) had one or more telehealth episodes of care, totaling 2.29 million telehealth 
episodes of care. Of these 782,000 Veterans using telehealth, 45 percent live in rural 
areas. VA’s major expansion for telehealth and telemental health over the next five 
6 
 
 
years, for both urban and rural Veterans, will focus on care in or near the Veteran’s 
home. VA’s target is to increase Veterans receiving some care through telehealth from 
13 percent to 20 percent using telehealth innovations like the VA Video Connect (VVC) 
application, which enables private encrypted video telehealth services from almost any 
mobile device or computer. VVC will be integrated into VA clinicians’ routine operations 
to provide Veterans another option for connecting with their care teams. 
Strengthening VA’s Workforce. Recruitment and retention are critical to ensuring 
that VA has the right doctors, nurses, clinicians, specialists and technicians to provide 
the care that Veterans need. The FY 2020 Budget strengthens VHA’s workforce by 
providing funding for 342,647 FTE, an increase of 13,066 over 2019.  VA is also actively 
implementing MISSION Act authorities that increased VA’s ability to recruit and retain 
the best medical providers by expanding existing loan repayment and clinical 
scholarship programs; it also established the authority to create several new programs 
focused on medical school students and recent graduates. VA is also implementing 
additional initiatives to enhance VA’s workforce, such as the expanded utilization of 
peer specialists and medical scribes.   
Business Transformation 
Business transformation is essential if we are to move beyond 
compartmentalization of the past and empower our employees serving Veterans in the 
field to provide world-class customer service. This means reforming the systems 
responsible for claims and appeals, GI Bill benefits, human resources, financial and 
acquisition management, supply chain management, and construction. The Office of 
Enterprise Integration (OEI) is charged with coordination for these efforts.   
Office of Enterprise Integration. The scale and criticality of the initiatives 
underway at VA require management discipline and strong governance. As part of 
OEI’s coordination role in VA’s business transformation efforts, we have implemented a 
consistent governance process to review progress against anticipated milestones, 
timelines, and budget. This process supports continuous alignment with objectives and 
identifies risks and impediments prior to their realization.   
For example, our VA Modernization Board recently initiated a leadership 
integration forum to synchronize deployment schedules across three major enterprise 
initiatives: adoption of Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS), financial 
management business transformation, and our new electronic health record. This forum 
allowed us to assess the feasibility of a concurrent deployment and identify an alternate 
course of action. By implementing strong governance and oversight, we are increasing 
accountability and transparency of our most critical initiatives.    
7 
 
 
Appeals Modernization. The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization 
Act of 2017 (AMA) was signed into law on August 23, 2017 and took effect on February 
19, 2019. The Appeals Modernization Act transforms VA’s complex and lengthy appeals 
process into one that is simple, timely, and fair to Veterans and ultimately gives 
Veterans choice and control over how to handle their claims and appeals.  
The FY 2020 request of $182 million for the Board of Veterans’ Appeals (the 
Board) is $7.3 million above the FY 2019 enacted budget and will sustain the 1,125 FTE 
who will adjudicate and process legacy appeals while implementing the Appeals 
Improvement and Modernization Act.  The Board continues to demonstrate its 
commitment to reducing legacy appeals and decided a historic number of appeals – 
85,288 -- in FY 2018, the highest number for any fiscal year. The Board is on pace to 
decide over 90,000 appeals in 2019.  
To ensure smooth implementation, the Board launched an aggressive workforce 
plan to recruit, hire, and train new employees in FY 2018.  The Board on-boarded 
approximately 242 new hires, including 217 attorneys/law clerks and approximately 20 
administrative personnel. 
The new appeals process features three decision-review lanes:  
1.  Higher-Level Review Lane: A senior-level claims processor at a VA 
regional office will conduct a new look at a previous decision based on the 
evidence of record. Reviewers can overturn previous decisions based on a 
difference of opinion or return a decision for correction.  VBA has a 125-day 
average processing goal for decisions issued in this lane.  
2.  Supplemental Claim Lane: Veterans can submit new and relevant 
evidence to support their claim, and a claims processor at a VA regional 
office will assist in developing evidence. VBA has a 125-day average 
processing goal for decisions issued in this lane. 
3.  Appeal Lane: Veterans who choose to appeal a decision directly to the 
Board of Veterans’ Appeals (Board) may request direct review of the 
evidence the regional office reviewed, submit additional evidence, or have a 
hearing. The Board has a 365-day average processing time goal for appeals 
in which the Veteran does not submit evidence or request a hearing. 
In addition to focusing on implementation of the Appeals Modernization Act, 
addressing pending legacy appeals will continue to be a priority for VBA and the Board 
in FY 2019. VBA’s efforts have resulted in appeals actions that have exceeded 
projections for fiscal year to date 2019. VBA plans to eliminate completely its legacy, 
non-remand appeals inventory in FY 2020 and significantly reduce its legacy remand 
inventory in FY 2020.  
Finally, VBA is also undertaking a similar, multi-pronged approach to modernize 
its appeals process through increased resources, technology, process improvements, 
and increased efficiencies. VBA’s compensation and pension appeals program is 
8 
 
 
supported by 2,100 FTEs. VBA added 605 FTEs in FY 2019 to process legacy appeals 
and decision reviews in the modernized process. As of October 1, 2018, to best 
maximize its resources an enable efficiencies, VBA centralized these assets to conduct 
higher-level reviews at two Decision Review Operation Centers (DROC). VBA will 
convert the current Appeals Resource Center in Washington, DC, into a third DROC 
using existing assets. 
Forever GI Bill. Since the passage of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational 
Assistance Act of August 16, 2017, VA has implemented 28 of the law’s 34 provisions. 
Twenty-two of the law’s 34 provisions require significant changes to VA information 
technology systems, and VA has 202 temporary employees in the field to support this 
additional workload.  
Sections 107 and 501 of the law change the way VA pays monthly housing 
stipends for GI Bill recipients, and VA is committed to providing a solution that is 
reliable, efficient and effective. Pending the deployment of a technology-based solution, 
Veterans and schools will continue to receive GI Bill benefit payments as normal. By 
asking schools to hold fall enrollments through the summer and not meeting the 
implementation date for the IT solutions of Sections 107 and 501, some beneficiaries 
experienced delayed and incorrect payments.   
In accordance with the Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act of 2018, 
VA established a Tiger Team tasked to resolve issues with implementing sections 107 
and 501 of the Forever GI Bill.  This month we awarded a new contract that we believe 
will provide the right solution for implementing Sections 107 and 501. By December 
2019, we will have Sections 107 and 501 fully implemented. By spring 2020, all 
enrollments will be processed according to the Colmery Act. We will recalculate benefits 
based on where Veterans take classes, and we will work with schools to make Sections 
107 and 501 payments retroactive to the first day of August 2018, the effective date. 
The Department is committed to making sure every Post-9/11 GI Bill beneficiary 
is made whole based on the rates established under the Forever GI Bill, and we are 
actively working to make that happen.  We got the word out to Veterans, beneficiaries, 
schools, VSOs, and other stakeholders that any Veteran who is in a financial hardship 
due to a late or delayed GI Bill payment should contact us immediately.   
In December 2018, we updated the housing rates like we normally would have in 
August. Those rates were effective for all payments after January 1, 2019. Additionally, 
we processed over 450,000 rate corrections, ensuring that any beneficiary who was 
underpaid from August through December received a check for the difference. We have 
completed the spring peak enrollment season without any significant challenges. We 
worked with schools to get enrollments submitted as quickly as possible.   
As VA moves forward with implementation, we will continue to regularly update 
our Veteran students and their institutions of learning on our progress and what to 
expect. Already, VA has modified its definition of ""campus"" to better align itself with 
9 
 
 
statutory requirements, and in doing so has lessened the administrative burden on 
schools to report to VA housing data. 
Information Technology Modernization. The FY 2020 budget request of $4.343 
billion continues VA’s investment in the Office of Information Technology (OIT) 
modernization effort, enabling VA to streamline efforts to operate more effectively and 
decrease our spending while increasing the services we provide. The budget allows OIT 
to deliver available, adaptable, secure, and cost-effective technology services to VA—
transforming the Department into an innovative, twenty first century organization—and 
to act as a steward for all VA’s IT assets and resources. OIT delivers the necessary 
technology and expertise that supports Veterans and their families through effective 
communication and management of people, technology, business requirements, and 
financial processes. 
The requested $401 million funds for development will be dedicated to mission 
critical areas, continued divestiture of legacy systems such as the Benefits Delivery 
Network and the Burial Operations Support System, and initiatives that are directly 
Veteran-facing.  Funds will continue to support Veteran focused initiatives such as 
Mental Health, MISSION Act and Community Care, and the continued transition from 
the legacy Financial Management System (FMS) to the new Integrated Financial and 
Acquisition Management System (iFAMS).  The Budget also invests $379 million for 
information security to protect Veterans’ information. 
Financial Management Business Transformation (FMBT). As mentioned above, a 
critical system that will touch the delivery of all health and benefits is our new financial 
and acquisition management system, iFAMS. In support of the Financial Management 
Business Transformation (FMBT) program, the FY 2020 budget requests $66 million in 
IT funds, $107 million in Franchise Fund Service Level Agreement (SLA) funding from 
the Administrations and other Staff Offices to be paid to the Financial Services Center 
(FSC), and General Administration funding of $11.9 million.  
Through the FMBT program, VA is working to implement an enterprise-wide 
financial and acquisition management system in partnership with our service provider, 
CGI Federal Inc. VA will utilize a cloud hosted solution, configured for VA, leveraging 
CGI’s Software as a Service (SaaS) model. VA will gain increased operational 
efficiency, productivity, reporting capability, and flexibility from a modern Enterprise 
Resource Planning (ERP) cloud solution. The new cloud solution will also provide 
additional security, storage, and scalability. 
 
Infrastructure Improvements and Streamlining. I want to thank Congress for 
providing $2 billion in additional funding for VA infrastructure in 2019. This additional 
funding for minor construction, seismic corrections, and non-recurring maintenance will 
enhance our ability to address infrastructure needs. In FY 2020, VA will continue 
improving its infrastructure while transforming our health care system to an integrated 
network to serve Veterans. This budget allows for the expansion of health care, burial 
and benefits services where needed most. The request includes $1.235 billion in Major 
Construction funding, as well as $399 million in Minor Construction to fund VA’s highest 
10 
 
 
priority infrastructure projects. These funding levels are consistent with our requests in 
recent years. 
 
Major and Minor Construction 
 
This funding supports major medical facility projects including providing the final 
funding required to complete these projects: New York, NY – Manhattan VAMC Flood 
Recovery, Bay Pines, FL – Inpatient/Outpatient Improvements, San Juan, PR – Seismic 
Corrections, Building 1; and Louisville, KY – New Medical Facility. The request also 
includes continued funding for ongoing major medical projects at San Diego, CA – 
Spinal Cord Injury and Seismic Corrections, Reno, NV – Correct Seismic Deficiencies 
and Expand Clinical Services Building, West Los Angeles, CA – Site utilities for Build 
New Critical Care Center, and Alameda, CA – Outpatient Clinic & National Cemetery.   
 
The 2020 request includes additional funding for the completion of the new 
cemetery at Western New York Cemetery (Elmira, NY) and the replacement of the 
cemetery at Bayamon, PR (Morovis), and expansion project at Riverside, CA. The 
national cemetery expansion and improvement projects at Houston and Dallas, TX and 
Massachusetts (Bourne, MA) are also provided for. The FY 2020 Budget provides funds 
for the continued support of major construction program including the seismic initiative 
that was implemented in 2019 to address VA’s highest priority facilities in need of 
seismic repairs and upgrades.   
 
  The request also includes $399 million in minor construction funds that will used 
to expand health care, burial and benefits services for Veterans. The minor construction 
request includes funding for 131 newly identified projects as well as existing partially 
funded projects.   
 
Leasing 
 
VA is also requesting authorization of seven major medical leases in 2020 to 
ensure access to health care is available in those areas. These leases include new 
leases totaling $33 million in Colombia, MO and Salt Lake City, UT as well as 
replacement leases totaling $104 million in Baltimore, MD; Atlanta, GA; Harlingen, TX; 
Jacksonville, NC; and Prince George’s County, MD. VA is requesting funding of $919 
million to support ongoing leases and delivery of additional leased facilities during the 
year. 
 
Repurposing or Disposing Vacant Facilities  
 
To maximize resources for Veterans, VA repurposed or disposed of 175 of the 
430 vacant or mostly vacant buildings since June 2017. Due diligence efforts 
(environmental/historic) for the remaining buildings are substantially complete, allowing 
them to proceed through the final disposal or reuse process. 
 
11 
 
 
Suicide Prevention 
Suicide is a national public health issue that affects all Americans, and the health 
and well-being of our nation’s Veterans is VA’s top priority. Twenty (20) Veterans, 
active-duty Servicemembers, and non-activated Guard or Reserve members die by 
suicide on average each day, and of those 20, 14 had not been in our care. That is why 
we are implementing broad, community-based prevention strategies, driven by data, to 
connect Veterans outside our system with care and support. The FY 2020 Budget 
requests $9.4 billion for mental health services, a $426 million increase over 2019. The 
Budget specifically invests $222 million for suicide prevention programming, a $15.6 
million increase over the 2019 enacted level. The request funds over 15.8 million mental 
health outpatient visits, an increase of nearly 78,000 visits over the 2019 estimate. This 
builds on VA’s current efforts. VA has hired more than 3,900 new mental health 
providers yielding a net increase in VA mental health staff of over 1,000 providers since 
July 2017. Nationally, in the first quarter of 2019, 90 percent of new patients completed 
an appointment in a mental health clinic within 30 days of scheduling an appointment, 
and 96.8 percent of established patients completed a mental health appointment within 
30 days of the day they requested.  
Preventing Veteran suicide requires closer collaboration between VA, DoD, and 
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). On January 9, 2018, President Trump 
signed an Executive Order (13822) titled, “Supporting Our Veterans During Their 
Transition from Uniformed Service to Civilian Life.” This Executive Order directs DoD, 
VA, and DHS to develop a Joint Action Plan that describes concrete actions to provide 
access to mental health treatment and suicide prevention resources for transitioning 
uniformed Servicemembers in the year following their discharge, separation, or 
retirement. On March 5, 2019, President Trump signed the National Roadmap to 
Empower Veterans and End Suicide Executive Order (13861), which creates a Veteran 
Wellness, Empowerment, and Suicide Prevention Task Force that is tasked with 
developing, within 1 year, a road map to empower Veterans to pursue an improved 
quality of life, prevent suicide, prioritize related research activities, and strengthen 
collaboration across the public and private sectors.  This is an all-hands-on-deck 
approach to empower Veteran well-being with the goal of ending Veteran suicide. 
For Servicemembers and Veterans alike, our collaboration with DoD and DHS is 
already increasing access to mental health and suicide prevention resources, due in 
large part to improved integration within VA, especially between the VBA and VHA. VBA 
and VHA have worked in collaboration with DoD and DHS to engage Servicemembers 
earlier and more consistently than we have ever done in the past. This engagement 
includes support to members of the National Guard, Reserves, and Coast Guard. 
VA’s suicide prevention efforts are guided by our National Strategy for Preventing 
Veteran Suicide, a long-term plan published in the summer of 2018 that provides a 
framework for identifying priorities, organizing efforts, and focusing national attention 
and community resources to prevent suicide among Veterans. It also focuses on 
adopting a broad public health approach to prevention, with an emphasis on 
comprehensive, community-based engagement.  
12 
 
 
However, VA cannot do this alone, and suicide is not solely a mental health 
issue. As a national problem, Veteran suicide can only be reduced and mitigated 
through a nationwide community-level approach that begins to solve the problems 
Veterans face, such as loss of belonging, meaningful employment, and engagement 
with family, friends, and community. 
The National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide provides a blueprint for 
how the nation can help to tackle the critical issue of Veteran suicide and outlines 
strategic directions and goals that involve implementation of programming across the 
public health spectrum, including, but not limited to: 
  Integrating and coordinating Veteran Suicide Prevention across multiple sectors 
and settings; 
  Developing public-private partnerships and enhancing collaborations across 
Federal agencies; 
  Implementing research informed communication efforts to prevent Veteran 
suicide by changing attitudes knowledge and behaviors; 
  Promoting efforts to reduce access to lethal means; 
  Implementation of clinical and professional practices for assessing and treating 
Veterans identified as being at risk for suicidal behaviors; and 
  Improvement of the timeliness and usefulness of national surveillance systems 
relevant to preventing Veteran suicide. 
Every day, more than 400 Suicide Prevention Coordinators (SPC) and their 
teams—located at every VA medical center—connect Veterans with care and educate 
the community about suicide prevention programs and resources. Through innovative 
screening and assessment programs such as REACH VET (Recovery Engagement and 
Coordination for Health–Veterans Enhanced Treatment), VA identifies Veterans who 
may be at risk for suicide and who may benefit from enhanced care, which can include 
follow-ups for missed appointments, safety planning, and care plans. 
VHA has also expanded its Veterans Crisis Line to three call centers and 
increased the number of Veterans served by the Readjustment Counseling Service 
(RCS), which provides services through the 300 Vet Centers, 80 Mobile Vet Centers 
(MVC), 20 Vet Center Outstations, over 960 Community Access Points and the Vet 
Center Call Center (877-WAR-VETS). In the last two fiscal years, clients benefiting from 
RCS services increased by 14 percent, and Vet Center visits for Veterans, 
Servicemembers, and families increased by 7 percent. 
We are committed to advancing our outreach, prevention, and treatment efforts 
to further restore the trust of our Veterans and continue to improve access to care and 
support inside and outside VA.  
13 
 
 
Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) 
We made a historic decision to modernize our electronic health record (EHR) 
system to provide our nation’s Veterans with seamless care as they transition from 
military service to Veteran status. On May 17, 2018, we awarded a ten-year contract to 
Cerner Government Services, Inc., to acquire the same EHR solution being deployed by 
DoD that allows patient data to reside in a single hosting site using a single common 
system to enable sharing of health information, improve care delivery and coordination, 
and provide clinicians with data and tools that support patient safety. The FY 2020 
Budget includes $1.6 billion to continue to support VA’s EHRM effort to create and 
implement a single longitudinal clinical health record from active duty to Veteran status, 
and to ensure interoperability with DoD.   
The request provides necessary resources for post Go-Live activities completion 
of Office of Electronic Health Record Modernization’s (OEHRM) three Initial Operating 
Capability (IOC) sites and full deployment of the remaining sites in Veterans Integrated 
Service Network (VISN) 20, the Pacific Northwest region. Additionally, it funds the 
concurrent deployment of waves comprised of sites in VISN 21 and VISN 22, the 
Southwest region. The solution will be deployed at VA medical centers, as well as 
associated clinics, Veteran centers, mobile units, and other ancillary facilities.  
We are working closely with DoD to synchronize efforts as we deploy and test 
the new health record. We are engaging front-line staff and clinicians to identify 
efficiencies, hone governance, refine configurations, and standardize processes for 
future locations. We are committed to a timeline that balances risks, patient safety, and 
user adoption while also working with DoD in providing a more comprehensive, agile, 
and coordinated management authority to execute requirements and mitigate potential 
challenges and obstacles.   
Throughout this effort, VA will continue to engage front-line staff and clinicians, 
as it is a fundamental aspect in ensuring we meet the program’s goals. We have begun 
work with the leadership teams in place in the Pacific Northwest. OEHRM has 
established clinical councils from the field that will develop National workflows and serve 
as change agents at the local level.  
Supply Chain Transformation 
VA has embarked on a supply chain transformation program designed to build a 
lean, efficient supply chain that provides timely access to meaningful data focused on 
patient and financial outcomes. We are pursuing a holistic modernization effort which 
will address people, training, processes, data and automated systems. To achieve 
greater efficiencies by partnering with other Government agencies, VA will strengthen 
its long-standing relationships with DoD by leveraging expertise to modernize VA’s 
supply chain operations, while allowing the VA to remain fully committed to providing 
quality health care and applying resources where they are most needed.  The FY 2020 
budget includes $36.8 million in IT funding to support this effort.  
14 
 
 
As we deploy an integrated health record, we are also collaborating with DoD on 
an enterprise-wide adoption of the Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support 
(DMLSS) to replace VA’s existing logistics and supply chain solution. VA’s current 
system faces numerous challenges and is not equipped to address the complexity of 
decision-making and integration required across functions, such as acquisition, logistics 
and construction. The DMLSS solution will ensure that the right products are delivered 
to the right places at the right time, while providing the best value to the government 
and taxpayers.   
We are piloting our Supply Chain Modernization program initially at the Captain 
James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC) and VA initial EHR sites in 
Spokane and Seattle to analyze VA enterprise-wide application. On March 7th, 2019, we 
initiated the pilot kickoff at the FHCC for VA’s business transformation and supply chain 
efforts. This decision leverages a proven system that DoD has developed, tested, and 
implemented.  In the future, DMLSS and its technical upgrade LogiCole will better 
enable whole-of-government sourcing and better facilitate VA’s use of DoD Medical 
Surgical Prime Vendor and other DoD sources, as appropriate, as the source for VA 
medical materiel.   
Veterans Homelessness  
The FY 2020 Presidents Budget (PB) continues the Administration’s support of 
VA’s Homelessness Programs, with $1.8 billion in funding, which maintains the 2019 
level of funding, including $380 million for Supportive Services for Veterans Families 
(SSVF).  
Over the past five years, VA and its federal partners have made a concerted 
effort to collaborate at the federal level to ensure strategic use of resources to end 
Veteran homelessness. Coordinated entry systems are the actualization of this 
coordinated effort at the local level. Coordinated entry is seen, and will continue to be 
seen, as the systematic approach that is needed at the community level to ensure that 
resources are being utilized in the most effective way possible and that every Veteran in 
that community is offered the resources he or she needs to end their homelessness. All 
homeless Veterans in a given community are impacted by the coordinated entry system 
given that its framework is designed to promote community-wide commitment to the 
goal of ending homelessness and utilizing community-wide resources (including VA 
resources) in the most efficient way possible for those Veterans who are in most need. 
This includes the prioritization of resources for those Veterans experiencing chronic, 
literal street homelessness. The number of Veterans experiencing homelessness in the 
United States has declined by nearly half since 2010. On a single night in January 2018, 
fewer than 40,000 Veterans were experiencing homelessness—5.4 percent fewer than 
in 2017.  
Since 2010, over 700,000 Veterans and their family members have been 
permanently housed or prevented from becoming homeless. As of December 19, 2018, 
69 areas—66 communities and three states—have met the benchmarks and criteria 
established by the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, VA, and the 
15 
 
 
Department of Housing and Urban Development to publicly announced an effective end 
to Veteran homelessness. 
Efforts to end Veteran homelessness have greatly expanded the services 
available to permanently house homeless Veterans and VA offers a wide array of 
interventions designed to find homeless Veterans, engage them in services, find 
pathways to permanent housing, and prevent homelessness from occurring. 
Opioid Safety & Reduction Efforts 
In October 2017, the President declared the opioid crisis in our country a public 
health emergency. Opioid safety and reduction efforts are a Department priority, and we 
have responded with new strategies to rapidly combat this national issue as it affects 
Veterans. Success requires collaboration among VA leadership and all levels of VA 
staff—from medical centers to headquarters—Congress, and community partners to 
ensure we are working with Veterans to achieve positive, life-changing results. The fact 
that opioid safety, pain care transformation, and treatment of opioid use disorder all 
contribute to reduction of suicide risk makes these efforts particularly important. The FY 
2020 Budget includes $397 million, a $15 million increase over 2019, to reduce over-
reliance on opioid analgesics for pain management and to provide safe and effective 
use of opioid therapy when clinically indicated. 
VA’s Opioid Safety Initiative has greatly reduced reliance on opioid medication 
for pain management, in part by reducing opioid prescribing by more than 50 percent 
over the past four years. Most of this progress is attributable to reductions in prescribing 
long-term opioid therapy by not starting Veterans with chronic, non-cancer pain on 
opioid therapy and, instead utilizing multimodal strategies that manage Veteran pain 
more effectively long-term such as acupuncture, behavioral therapy, chiropractic care, 
yoga, and non-opioid medications. 
We are committed to providing Veteran-centric, holistic care for the management 
of pain and for promoting well-being. We are seeing excellent results as sites across the 
country deploy this “Whole Health” approach. Non-medication treatments work as well 
and are often better than opioids at controlling non-cancer pain. We want to assure 
Congress—and Veterans on opioid therapy—that Veterans’ medication will not be -
decreased or stopped without their knowledge, engagement, and a thoughtful 
discussion of accessible alternatives. Our goal is to make sure every Veteran has the 
best function, quality of life, and pain control. 
Women’s Health 
VA has made significant progress serving women Veterans in recent years. We 
now provide full services to women Veterans, including comprehensive primary care, 
gynecology care, maternity care, specialty care, and mental health services.  The FY 
2020 Budget requests $547 million for gender specific women Veterans’ health care, a 
$42 million increase over 2019.  
16 
 
 
The number of women Veterans using VHA services has tripled since 2000, 
growing from nearly 160,000 to over 500,000 today. To accommodate the rapid growth, 
VHA has expanded services and sites of care across the country. VA now has at least 
two Women’s Heath Primary Care Provider (WH-PCP) at all of VA’s health care 
systems. In addition, 91 percent of community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) have a 
WH-PCP in place. VHA now has gynecologists on site at 133 sites and mammography 
on site at 65 locations. For severely injured Veterans, we also now offer in vitro 
fertilization services through care in the community and reimbursement of adoption 
costs.  
VHA is in the process of training additional providers so every woman Veteran 
has an opportunity to receive primary care from a WH-PCP. Since 2008, 5,800 
providers have been trained in women’s health. In fiscal year 2018, 968 Primary Care 
and Emergency Care Providers were trained in local and national trainings. VA has also 
developed a mobile women’s health training for rural VA sites to better serve rural 
women Veterans, who make up 26 percent of women Veterans. This budget will also 
continue to support a fulltime Women Veterans Program Manager at every VHA health 
care system who is tasked with advocating for the health care needs of women 
Veterans. 
VA is at the forefront of information technology for women’s health and is 
redesigning its electronic medical record to track breast and reproductive health care. 
Quality measures show that women Veterans who receive care from VA are more likely 
to receive breast cancer and cervical cancer screening than women in private sector 
health care. VA also tracks quality by gender and, unlike some other health care 
systems, has been able to reduce and eliminate gender disparities in important aspects 
of health screening, prevention, and chronic disease management. We are also 
factoring care for women Veterans into the design of new VA facilities and using new 
technologies, including social media, to reach women Veterans and their families. We 
are proud of our care for women Veterans and are working to increase the trust and 
knowledge of VA services of women Veterans, so they choose VA for benefits and 
services. 
National Cemetery Administration (NCA)  
The President’s FY 2020 budget positions NCA to meet Veterans’ emerging 
burial and memorial needs through the continued implementation of its key priorities:  
Preserving the Legacy: Ensuring “No Veteran Ever Dies”; Providing Access and 
Choosing VA; and Partnering to Serve Veterans. The FY 2020 Budget includes $329 
million for NCA’s operations and maintenance account, an increase of $13.2 million (4.2 
percent) over the FY 2019 level. This request will fund the 2,008 Full-Time Equivalent 
(FTE) employees needed to meet NCA’s increasing workload and expansion of 
services, while maintaining our reputation as a world-class service provider. In FY 2020, 
NCA will inter an estimated 137,000 Veterans and eligible family members and care for 
over 3.9 million gravesites. NCA will continue to memorialize Veterans by providing 
383,570 headstones and markers, distributing 634,000 Presidential Memorial 
17 
 
 
Certificates, and expanding the Veterans Legacy Program to communities across the 
country to increase awareness of Veteran service and sacrifice.   
 
VA is committed to investing in NCA’s infrastructure, particularly to keep existing 
national cemeteries open and to construct new cemeteries consistent with burial 
policies approved by Congress. NCA is amid the largest expansion of the cemetery 
system since the Civil War. By 2022, NCA will establish 18 new national cemeteries 
across the country, including rural and urban locations. The FY 2020 request also 
includes $172 million in major construction funds for three gravesite expansion projects 
(Houston and Dallas, TX and Bourne, MA) and additional funding for the replacement 
cemetery in Bayamon, PR, the gravesite expansion project in Riverside, CA, and the 
new national cemetery in Western NY. The Budget also includes $45 million for the 
Veteran Cemetery Grant Program to continue important partnerships with States and 
tribal organizations. Upon completion of these expansion projects, and the opening of 
new national, State and tribal cemeteries, nearly 95 percent of the total Veteran 
population—about 20 million Veterans—will have access to a burial option in a national 
or grant-funded Veterans cemetery within 75 miles of their homes. 
Accountability  
  The FY 2020 Budget requests direct appropriations for the Office of 
Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP) for the first time since it was 
established.  The total request for OAWP in FY 2020 is $22.2 million, which is $4.5 
million, or 25 percent higher than the 2019 funding level. This funding level 
demonstrates VA’s commitment to improving the performance and accountability of our 
senior executives through thorough, timely, and unbiased investigations of all 
allegations and concerns.  This funding level will also enable OAWP to continue to 
provide protection of valued whistleblowers against retaliation for their disclosures under 
the whistleblower protections provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 714.  In FY 2018, OAWP 
assessed 2,241 submissions, conducted 133 OAWP investigations, and monitored over 
1,000 referred investigations. These efforts are part of VA’s effort to build public trust 
and confidence in the entire VA system and are critical to our transformation.   
  The FY 2020 budget also requests $207 million, a $15 million increase over 
2019, and 1,000 FTE for the Office of Inspector General (OIG) to fulfill statutory 
oversight requirements and sustain the investments made in people, facilities, and 
technology during the last three years. The 2020 budget supports FTE targets 
envisioned under a multi-year effort to grow the OIG to a size that is more appropriate 
for overseeing the Department’s steadily rising spending on new complex systems and 
initiatives. The 2020 budget request will also provide sufficient resources for the OIG to 
continue to timely and effectively address the increased number of reviews and reports 
mandated through statute.   
Conclusion 
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to address our FY 2020 
budget and FY 2021 AA budget request. VA has shown demonstrable improvement 
18 
 
 
over the last several months. The resources requested in this budget will ensure VA 
remains on track to meet Congressional intent to implement the MISSION Act and 
continue to optimize care within VHA.   
Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with you and this Subcommittee. I am 
eager to continue building on the successes we have had so far and to continue to fulfill 
the President’s promise to provide care to Veterans when and where they need it. There 
is significant work ahead of us and we look forward to building on our reform agenda 
and delivering an integrated VA that is agile and adaptive and delivers on our promises 
to America’s Veterans. 
Thank you.

For release only by the  
Senate Committee 
on Appropriations 
 
Statement by 
 Sonny Perdue 
Secretary of Agriculture 
Before the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies 
Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate 
 
April 11, 2019 
 
Mr. Chairman and distinguished Members of this Subcommittee, it is a privilege to appear 
before you today to provide an overview of the Department’s proposed budget for fiscal year 
(FY) 2020. Joining me today are Robert Johansson, the USDA’s Chief Economist, and Erica 
Navarro, USDA’s Budget Officer.  
When I appeared before you a year ago, I laid out my vision for making USDA the best 
managed department in the Federal government. Since then, USDA made great strides toward 
becoming the most effective, most efficient, and most customer-focused department in the federal 
government. USDA has worked to create rural economic opportunities and improve the quality of 
life for rural Americans. Rural Development invested in new and improved high-speed e-
Connectivity and electricity for 7 million residents and improved water and wastewater 
infrastructure for nearly 3 million rural customers. USDA also launched an initiative to provide 
comprehensive and timely support to veterans interested in opportunities in agriculture, 
agribusiness, and in rural America.  
USDA played a significant role in helping rural communities and agricultural producers 
recover from hurricane-related damage and wildfires. USDA assistance has included providing 
children affected by Hurricane Florence access to free meals, helping Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients replace food lost due to power outages, helped businesses 
and utilities by considering requests to defer principal and/or interest payments, and provided 
emergency farm loans to impacted operations. 
In 2018, the Department worked with Federal partners to deliver new and improved trade 
deals like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and a re-negotiated United States-Korea 
Free Trade Agreement and provided trade assistance to farmers due to unjustified trade 
1 
 
retaliation. Efforts to break down barriers and pursue export opportunities resulted in new or 
expanded market access for numerous U.S. farm products in 2018. USDA sponsored six 
agricultural trade missions in 2018, enabling more than 200 U.S. companies and organizations to 
engage in 3,000 one-on-one meetings with foreign buyers, generating more than $140 million in 
projected 12-month sales. Similarly, USDA organized exporter participation in 19 trade shows 
around the globe, where more than 900 U.S. companies introduced 4,500 new products to 
potential customers and reported $296 million in on-site sales and $2 billion in projected 12-
month sales.  
Since we last met, USDA worked with local school officials to explore reforms that will 
make school meals more appealing by giving control back to local school food professionals who 
know the children best. Based on the input received, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) 
finalized a rule to allow for more flexibilities for schools to offer nutritious and satisfying meals 
to children, reduce food waste, and ease operational burdens for the National School Lunch 
Program and School Breakfast Program. With a focus on the Administration’s priority of moving 
SNAP participants to self-sufficiency through work, FNS proposed another rule to improve and 
strengthen our efforts in moving able-bodied adults without dependents participants to work.  
We refocused USDA to be more customer-oriented, merging where it made sense to 
maximize efficiencies, while modernizing and optimizing Information Technology (IT) to 
improve delivery of services. USDA stood up the Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) 
mission area. We also launched the FPAC Business Center in 2018 to eliminate redundant 
administrative support functions. USDA successfully merged the Agricultural Marketing Service, 
the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration, and the Farm Service Agency’s 
(FSA) Commodity Operations programs to better meet the needs of farmers, ranchers, producers, 
and consumers while improving customer service and maximizing efficiencies. We continued 
efforts to optimize and consolidate Enterprise Data Centers by closing 21 in 2018 which together 
with prior closures is expected to achieve $21.5 million in cost savings/avoidance by 2021. We 
also decreased the number of cybersecurity critical vulnerabilities per endpoint by 62 percent and 
the number of high-risk vulnerabilities by 73 percent in 2018, decreasing USDA’s weaknesses in 
software or hardware that can be exploited by a hacker. After reviewing the motor fleet, we were 
able to identify over 4,200 underutilized fleet vehicles (over 10 percent of the USDA fleet) that

are being targeted for disposal, which is estimated to reduce USDA costs by $26 million in FY 
2019 and beyond. 
2020 President’s Budget 
The President’s Budget recognizes the overriding need to reduce the Federal deficit, and 
USDA shares in the responsibility of controlling Federal spending. There are proposals in the 
budget for USDA that will produce real savings in both mandatory and discretionary spending.  
The Budget includes proposals to cut programs that achieved their goals or do not work, 
eliminate wasteful or duplicative spending, streamline government operations, and limit spending 
to achieve deficit reduction goals. The President’s 2020 Budget lays out a vision for a Federal 
government that is efficient, effective, and accountable. 
USDA’s total budget authority request pending before this Subcommittee, proposes a total 
of $143.2 billion in 2020, compared to $137 billion in 2019, primarily due to an anticipated 
decrease in SNAP participation and crop insurance payments. The discretionary appropriation 
request for this Subcommittee is $15.7 billion, which is lower than the $20.2 billion under the 
annualized continuing resolution for 2019. 
For 2020, we will continue to prioritize customer service every day for our customers – 
the American taxpayers. We will strive to conduct the people’s business efficiently, effectively, 
and with the utmost integrity. We will promote the ability of America’s agricultural sector to 
produce and sell the food and fiber that feeds and clothes the world and to reap the earned reward 
of their labor. By promoting American agricultural products, we will work to remove obstacles 
and give farmers, ranchers, foresters, and producers every opportunity to prosper and thrive. 
Through our programs and working closely with our customers, we will facilitate rural prosperity 
through the expansion of rural business opportunities and improved infrastructure. We will also 
work to preserve the land. USDA will continue to ensure that all Americans have access to a safe 
and secure food supply. 
Become the Best Managed Department in the Federal Government 
   For FY 2020, the President’s Budget supports new and continuing investments in IT 
modernization by USDA to improve customer service and streamline and modernize rural and 
farm program and service delivery. In addition, the Budget continues support for the business 
functions of the FPAC Mission Area by streamlining service delivery between FSA, the Natural 
3 
 
Resources Conservation Service, and Risk Management Agency to improve efficiency, 
effectiveness, and accountability. To maximize the effectiveness of these customer-focused 
improvements, the Department must modernize its own back-office technology capabilities. The 
Budget includes an increase of $31.5 million to begin the transition to a modernized enterprise 
network in FY 2020.   
In the National Capital Region (NCR), the Department is starting the OneNeighborhood 
initiative to better utilize office space in the Washington, DC Headquarters Complex. The 
Budget requests $266 million for the initiative to increase the occupancy capacity through life 
and health safety upgrades; space reconfigurations; and the replacement of outdated building 
systems. The efforts will allow the Department to reduce its lease costs in the NCR that amount 
to approximately $40 million annually.  
 In August, USDA announced we would realign the Economic Research Service (ERS) 
under the Office of the Chief Economist and would relocate both ERS and the National Institute 
of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) outside of the NCR. Those changes will improve customer 
service, strengthen offices and programs, and save taxpayer dollars. USDA received 136 
expressions of interest submissions from 35 states. The firm Ernst & Young was retained to 
evaluate and conduct the site selection process. On March 12, we announced 68 expressions of 
interest remain under consideration. We recognize there are outstanding questions regarding this 
decision and are committed to an open process as we move forward together to address concerns.  
The President’s 2020 Budget includes an estimate of the funds necessary to move these agencies 
outside the NCR, but final costs will be dependent on the location selected. 
Create Conditions so Agricultural Operations Can Prosper, Fulfilling Their Mission to 
Feed, Fuel, and Clothe the World 
Over the past year, USDA responded to conditions that tested the resilience of American 
farmers with initiatives to create economic conditions in which they can prosper.  With the help 
of crop insurance, natural disaster assistance programs, and short-term trade mitigation 
programs, many producers are managing the stresses of these difficult times and are indicating 
increased optimism, particularly with expectations that trade partnerships will strengthen in the 
near future. As we implement the 2018 Farm Bill we will work toward achieving the primary 
goal of farm programs: to help farmers and ranchers manage risks and continue producing food, 
fiber, and fuel in good years as well as bad. The Budget estimates net CCC expenditures of 
4 
 
$6.5 billion which includes all the commodity programs, CRP and CCC funded trade programs. 
This compares to the estimated $20.9 billion net CCC expenditures that we anticipate in FY 
2019, which includes disaster and trade mitigation assistance in addition to the other programs. 
In addition to mandatory funding provided by the 2018 Farm Bill, the President’s Budget 
provides resources to help agricultural operations prosper, fulfilling their mission to feed, fuel, 
and clothe the world. Funding is requested to support the estimated $7.7 billion demand for farm 
loans that provide access to credit to about 48,800 producers, 80 percent of whom are beginning 
farmers and ranchers, veterans, and socially disadvantaged producers. It provides nearly 
$1 billion for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to promote the health of animal 
and plant resources and facilitate their movement in the global marketplace, as well as the 
welfare of certain animals. For agricultural research and extension activities, the Budget includes 
a total of $2.9 billion, including $500 million for competitive grants through the Agriculture and 
Food Research Initiative. The Budget includes a total of $66 million to take ownership of and 
operational responsibility for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF), in addition to 
funding to transition and expand the Agricultural Research Service and the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service research and diagnostic programs at NBAF.  
Expand Foreign Markets and Promote U.S. Products Around the World 
USDA is committed to helping U.S. farmers and ranchers identify and access new export 
markets and expanding trade opportunities. With around 20 percent of farm income derived from 
exports, it is critical that USDA work with the American food and agriculture community to 
ensure farmers, ranchers, and food manufacturers and workers can fairly compete against anyone 
in overseas markets. To support this mission, the Budget includes $503 million to reduce trade 
barriers that disadvantage U.S. agricultural exports and to open new markets for U.S. farm 
products. Within this amount, funding is also requested to preserve or expand trade valued 
between $6 billion to $8 billion through resolution of foreign market access issues. To facilitate 
exports to buyers in countries that may not have access to adequate commercial credit, the 
Budget includes a program level of $5.5 billion for CCC Export Guarantee Programs to provide 
guarantees.

Facilitate Rural Prosperity and Economic Development 
American prosperity and well-being are intrinsically tied to rural America’s ability to 
thrive in the new global economy; to build and attract an educated workforce and expand its 
population base; and to use its diverse and abundant natural resources to provide food, fiber, 
forest products, energy, and recreation. Through the Task Force on Agriculture and Rural 
Prosperity, the Department has identified actions to improve the quality of life and expand 
economic development in rural communities. Many of these actions are supported through 
investments made in USDA lending activities to rural utilities and communities and to strengthen 
investments in housing programs. 
The President’s 2020 Budget for USDA includes investments to increase prosperity in 
rural America that are in addition to the Administration’s $200 billion infrastructure proposal. 
For USDA, the Budget proposes over $2.9 billion in budget authority to support $38.3 billion in 
Federal funds to stimulate public-private partnerships needed to build rural infrastructure 
including broadband, community facilities, safe and affordable housing, health services and 
facilities, and provide capacity-building to help underserved communities become thriving 
communities. This includes $690 million in loans that enhance telecommunications 
infrastructure and $200 million to support loans and grants to support high-speed broadband 
series to communities with populations under 20,000. The Budget supports $5.5 billion in loans 
for rural electric improvements, benefiting rural residents through the expanded use of smart grid 
technologies. The Budget also includes $1.7 billion to improve water and wastewater services for 
1.5 million rural residents and $3.1 billion to provide access to improved community facilities 
for over 5 million rural residents. The budget provides $24 billion to lenders in providing 
160,000 low- to moderate-income households the opportunity to own their primary residence 
through the single-family housing guaranteed loan program. The budget also includes 
$1.4 billion to fully fund multi-family rental assistance grants for about 281,000 contracts.   
Provide All Americans Access to a Safe, Nutritious, and Secure Food Supply 
A plentiful supply of safe and nutritious food is essential to the healthy development of 
every child in America and to the well-being and productivity of every family. USDA works to 
help prevent foodborne illness and protect public health as well as aid access to safe, nutritious, 
and balanced meals and promote a healthy diet. The Budget includes mandatory funds to support 
estimated participation levels for SNAP and Child Nutrition programs, and discretionary funds to 
6 
 
serve all expected participants level in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, 
Infants, and Children (WIC). It also includes the funding needed to meet our responsibility for 
providing inspection services to the Nation’s meat, poultry, and processed egg product 
establishments.   
Program Reforms 
The 2020 President’s Budget includes legislative proposals to reform programs to better 
target Federal dollars, while contributing to deficit reduction efforts. This includes several 
legislative proposals that we also included in the FY 2019 Budget to better target commodity 
conservation assistance, and crop insurance that would generate savings of $47.8 billion over ten 
years compared to current baseline spending. In addition, the Budget proposes to delink the 
Section 32 program from customs receipts, and replace the receipt funding with direct mandatory 
appropriation direct from the Treasury. Our proposal funds all of the current Section 32 nutrition 
programs and provides stable funding for surplus commodity donations the Budget’s proposals 
will ensure stable historical levels of funding for all the nutrition programs that have traditionally 
benefited from these activities while also increasing transparency, improving operational 
efficiency, generating savings of $5.1 billion over 10 years.   
The Budget also supports a foundational principle that those who need assistance have 
access to wholesome and healthy foods. The Budget includes an approach to nutrition assistance 
that combines the use of traditional SNAP Electronic Benefit Transfer cards with a USDA 
Harvest Box that contains 100-percent American grown products. States would have the ability 
to provide choice to their recipients, including innovative approaches for the inclusion of fresh 
products. In addition, the Budget focuses on innovative administrative reforms on outcome-
based employment strategies. The Budget also includes proposals to reserve benefits for those 
most in need, promote efficiency in State operations, and strengthen program integrity. 
Specifically, the proposals for SNAP have the potential to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse by 
limiting opportunities for benefits to be misused or trafficked. Combined, these reforms to 
nutrition assistance programs maintain the Administration’s commitment to ensuring Americans 
in need of assistance have access to a nutritious diet while reducing the cost to taxpayers by 
approximately $216 billion over 10 years. 
Disaster Relief 
7 
 
As I mentioned earlier, farmers and ranchers were battered last year by a series of 
monumental storms, robbing them of their livelihoods and inflicting damage well beyond the 
financial risks they normally assume in their operations. These are the men and women who 
dedicate their lives to feeding, fueling, and clothing this nation, and we cannot turn our backs on 
them when they need assistance. In 2017, Congress provided supplemental assistance for 
producers who experienced losses not covered by existing forms of relief. USDA stands ready to 
quickly implement assistance, bolstered by lessons learned, for similar losses in 2018 should 
Congress decide once again to act.  
Conclusion 
In the face of a growing national debt, the President has offered a fiscally responsible 
budget that no longer puts off the tough decisions to future generations. The budget will support 
a robust economy that created 200,000 jobs in January, with unemployment at 3.8 percent in 
February. Recent estimates predict Gross Domestic Product will grow at a rate of about 
2.5 percent. Nonetheless, according to the US Treasury, the National debt has grown to more 
than $22 trillion as of March 15, 2019. The Trump Administration has proposed a budget that is 
fiscally responsible and no longer puts off the tough decisions to future generations.  At USDA, 
we will do our part to reduce government spending. 
I would be happy to answer any questions at this time.

April 11, 2019   
Good morning,  Chairman Blunt, Ranking Member Murray, and distinguished  Members 
of the Subcommittee.  I am Francis S. Collins,  M.D., Ph.D., and I have served as the Director of 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2009.  It is an honor to appear before you today. 
Before I discuss NIH’s Budget request for the upcoming  fiscal year and some of the 
exciting scientific opportunities  on the horizon,  I want to express my gratitude to the leadership 
and members of this Subcommittee.  In FY 2019, NIH received an increase of $2 billion.   I can 
promise you that we are investing  those resources in groundbreaking  research as quickly as we 
can. 
Biomedical  research at NIH seeks to push forward the frontier of knowledge, from basic 
science to translational  research to clinical  trials, and success relies on vision,  risk-taking,  and a 
tireless pursuit of the next scientific question.  NIH will continue to invest in people, programs, 
infrastructure, and technology with these goals in mind, consistently  striving for breakthroughs 
that culminate in improvements in human health and wellbeing.   From harnessing new 
technologies  to supporting  the next generation of researchers, NIH will invest its resources to 
ensure that the U.S. remains at the forefront of innovation  and discovery.   
The FY 2020 President’s Budget provides $34.4 billion  for NIH, seeking to fund the 
highest priority  scientific  discoveries  while also maintaining  fiscal stewardship of Federal 
resources.  This Budget will prioritize  biomedical  research to confront our nation’s greatest 
medical challenges,  including  the opioid  crisis, precision  medicine,  and pediatric cancer.   
As in previous years, the Budget proposes to streamline federal research by 
consolidating  activities  of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) into a 
new National  Institute for Research on Safety and Quality (NIRSQ) within  the NIH.  The 
1 
 
Budget provides NIRSQ $256 million  to support its activities  to improve  the quality, 
safety, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care.   
America’s continuing  leadership in biomedical  research requires infrastructure and 
facilities capable of housing safe, reproducible  research in compliance with all laws and 
regulations and conducive to cutting edge research.  NIH buildings  include inpatient 
hospital beds, Biosafety containment facilities,  biomedical  research laboratories, animal 
holding  facilities,  and even a utility  plant. NIH’s backlog of maintenance and repair now 
exceeds $1.8 billion.    
NIH is aggressively using FY 2019 funding to address some of this backlog and 
ensure our facilities are both safe for patients and conducive to cutting-edge research and 
research support.  The FY 2020 Budget invests in NIH’s facilities by again proposing $200 
million  to support multiple  biomedical  research infrastructure priorities  at NIH-owned sites.   
One of my personal priorities  since joining  NIH has been to develop and support the 
next generation of biomedical  researchers.  In August 2017, NIH launched the Next 
Generation Researchers Initiative to address the challenges faced by researchers trying to 
embark upon and sustain independent research careers.  I am pleased to report that NIH met 
its ambitious  goal of funding 1,100 early-stage investigators in FY 2018.  In fact, we funded 
1,287, the largest number in history.  The FY 2020 Budget includes a dedicated fund of $100 
million  in the Office of the Director to support the prioritization  of meritorious applications 
to support early stage investigators that have never been funded by an award, or current NIH-
supported researchers at risk of losing support.  NIH remains committed to the development, 
support, and retention of our next generation of investigators.   
2 
 
This is a remarkable time in biomedical  research.  Truly exciting,  world class science 
is taking place through NIH support, and leading to breakthroughs in multiple  areas.  I would 
like to provide just a few examples of the depth and breadth of the amazing  research the FY 
2020 Budget supports. 
The FY 2020 Budget continues to invest in Precision Medicine.  Less than one year 
ago, NIH formally launched national enrollment  for the All of Us Research Program.  This 
program is on pace to enroll one million  or more U.S. volunteers in an ambitious  effort to 
accelerate health research and medical breakthroughs.  With this Committee’s long-standing 
support, we are closer than ever to building  the most diverse biomedical  data resource of its 
kind.  By analyzing  individual  differences in lifestyle, environment,  and biology,  researchers 
will uncover paths toward delivering  precision medicine,  an emerging approach for disease 
prevention and treatment. 
As of April 7, 2019, more than 212,000 people have begun the enrollment process, 
and more than 129,000 have completed all the steps in the protocol.  The All of Us Research 
Program is committed to engaging individuals  from all walks of life, including  those who 
may not have been asked to participate in research previously,  and more than 75 percent of 
participants are from communities  that have been underrepresented in biomedical  research.  
This diversity  has the power to revolutionize  standards for inclusivity  in research and for 
generalizability  of biomedical  research findings across many communities,  with the ultimate 
goal of spurring discoveries that bring the promise of precision medicine to all of us.  The  
FY 2020 Budget provides $313 million  to support the All of Us Research Program. 
 
3 
 
Millions  of Americans across the Nation have been devastated by opioid  misuse, 
addiction  and overdose.  To help bring scientific solutions  to this crisis, and to provide safe 
and effective options for the more than 25 million  Americans who suffer from daily chronic 
pain, NIH launched the Helping to End Addiction  Long-term (HEAL) Initiative.   This 
Committee made a historic investment of $500 million  in our work in FY 2018 and built upon 
that investment in FY 2019 with an additional  investment of $500 million.   Through HEAL, 
NIH will build  on basic science discoveries to accelerate the development of novel 
medications and devices to treat all aspects of the opioid  addiction  cycle, including  chronic 
use, withdrawal symptoms, craving, relapse, and overdose.  NIH has launched a series of new 
studies to test both new non-addictive medications and non-pharmacological  strategies for 
pain management, with the goal of targeted treatments for the millions  of Americans living 
with chronic pain.  The FY 2020 Budget continues the special investment of $500 million  that 
was started in FY 2018, and supports a total of $1.3 billion  for opioids  and pain research 
across NIH, ensuring that we continue to respond aggressively to the crisis of pain and 
addiction  in our communities. 
Cancer is the leading cause of death from disease among children and adolescents in 
the United States. Although substantial progress has been made in the treatment of several 
types of childhood  cancer, progress against other types has been limited.  Even when long-
term survival is achieved, many survivors of childhood  cancer may experience long-term 
adverse effects from the disease or its treatment. More research is needed to develop new, 
more-effective, and safer treatments for childhood  cancer.  The President recently launched an 
initiative  to support pediatric cancer research.  The FY 2020 Budget provides $50 million  for 
a data initiative  that will  support the development  of new, more effective, and safer treatments 
4 
 
for childhood  cancers, and will facilitate aggregation of data to create a federated, 
comprehensive, and shared resource to support childhood  cancer research. 
First identified  in 1981, AIDS is one of humanity’s deadliest and most persistent 
epidemics. Although  significant  progress has been made in the fight against new infections 
and AIDS deaths, the HIV/AIDS pandemic continues around the world.  The development of 
a safe and effective HIV vaccine remains a key component to realizing  an end to the 
HIV/AIDS pandemic.  The NIH-wide HIV research program will  continue to sustain the 
accomplishments  already made and secure future advances to prevent the spread of HIV; 
improve health outcomes for persons with, at risk for, or affected by HIV; and ultimately  to 
find a cure for HIV.  The FY 2020 Budget includes $6 million  for NIH to support the 
President’s Ending HIV Epidemic Initiative.  The NIH-funded Centers for AIDS Research and 
AIDS Research Centers are leveraging critical relationships  with local and state public health 
services, communities,  and research institutions  to develop and refine evidence-based, 
community-specific  strategies that will help guide this initiative. 
The FY 2020 Budget continues to invest in research progress toward the important but 
scientifically  challenging  effort to develop a universal influenza vaccine.  NIH-supported 
research is helping  advance understanding  of how influenza strains emerge, evolve, infect, 
and cause disease.  These research results are informing  design of new and improved 
therapies, diagnostics,  and vaccines.  Influenza viruses pose an ever-present public health 
threat and place substantial health and economic burdens on the U.S. and the world.  The FY 
2020 Budget will accelerate research progress to achieve the end goal of a universal influenza 
vaccine, which is vital to protecting millions  of people from infection and mitigating  the 
public health threat posed by influenza  viruses.   
5 
 
NIH is at the vanguard of biomedical  research, leading the world in support of 
groundbreaking  science.  Thank you again for inviting  NIH to testify today. We look forward 
to answering your questions.

Chairman Hyde-Smith, Senator Murphy, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss our fiscal year 
(FY) 2020 budget request. I greatly appreciate the subcommittee’s 
support of our efforts to serve the Congress and improve government 
performance, accountability, and transparency. 
Since 2014, with the funding the Subcommittee has provided, GAO has 
produced work resulting in over $340 billion in financial benefits and more 
than 6,300 other improvements in federal programs and operations for 
our government. In fiscal year (FY) 2018, GAO’s work yielded a record 
$75.1 billion in financial benefits, a return of about $124 for every dollar 
invested in GAO. We also identified 1,294 other benefits that led to 
improved services to the American people and program and operational 
improvements across the government. 
 
GAO is requesting $647.6 million in appropriated funds and authority to

increase. These resources will fund 3,250 full-time equivalents (FTE). The 
funding requested will also allow us to continue to make investments in 
our information technology and building infrastructure, security 
requirements, as well as address long deferred maintenance needs. 
This level of funding will enable GAO to meet the highest priority needs of 
the Congress, as we remain committed to helping Congress meet its 
constitutional responsibilities for the benefit of the American people. In FY 
2018, for example, we received 786 requests, including hundreds of

issues concerning Financial Technology (fintech), the need for revised 
cost estimation and scheduling policies by the National Science 
Foundation for large facilities, assessments of the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration’s (NASA) major projects, and critical 
infrastructure protection. We also used our technology readiness 
assessment best practices guide to evaluate major technical systems 
acquisitions such as those found at the Department of Defense (DOD), 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Energy 
(Energy), NASA and other agencies.1 
To enhance our ability to provide Congress with thorough and balanced 
analysis of technological and scientific developments that affect our 
society, environment, and economy, we established the Science, 
Technology Assessment, and Analytics team in January 2019. Our new 
team will expand our support to Congress by: 
•  conducting technology assessments and providing technical services; 
•  reviewing science and technology programs and initiatives to assist in 
oversight of federal investments in research, development, and 
advanced manufacturing; 
•  compiling and utilizing best practices in engineering sciences, 
including cost, schedule, and technology readiness assessments; and 
•  establishing an audit innovation lab to explore, pilot, and deploy new 
advanced analytic capabilities, conduct research in information 
assurance, and explore emerging technologies that will impact future 
audit practices. 
Technology Assessments, Our technology assessments explain the 
consequences that certain technology will have on the federal 
government—and on society as a whole. 
•  Economic competiveness. Our work has covered a range of topics 
including artificial intelligence, connectivity and the Internet of Things, 
innovation in data analytics, and 3D printing. 
•  Energy and the environment. We have reported on topics like 
improving municipal freshwater scarcity, reducing freshwater use in 
hydraulic fracturing and thermoelectric power plant cooling, and 
climate engineering. 
                                                                                                                     
1 We use these assessments in addition to two other best practices guides for capital 
acquisitions:  life cycles cost estimating and project scheduling. 
Page 3  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Health care. We have evaluated enabling rapid diagnoses of 
infectious diseases and the implications of nanomanufacturing on 
human health. We are currently investigating the impact of artificial 
intelligence on health care. 
•  Homeland security. We have examined the use of explosive 
detection technologies to protect passenger trains, and the use of 
biometrics for border security. 
GAO has published a number of technology assessments on established 
and emerging technology. We continue to provide evidence-based 
analysis to assist policymakers with the privacy and security implications 
of technology, as well as the management of federal investments in 
technology and science. We also develop best practice guides, such as 
our technology readiness assessment guide. Some of the key reports 
GAO has issued include:

Ongoing and planned technology assessments in FY 2019 include 
freshwater technologies in agriculture, the implications of artificial 
intelligence on healthcare, 5G wireless communications systems, and 
epidemiological models for emerging infectious diseases. The requested 
resources will enable us to expand and accelerate our work including 
potential technology readiness assessments of complex technical 
acquisitions such as nuclear modernization programs, the Army’s Next 
Generation Combat Vehicle program, DHS border protection 
technologies, and Uranium Processing Facility, among others. To bolster 
the new team, GAO has begun efforts to recruit additional staff with 
expertise in: 
•  biological/life sciences for emerging infectious diseases, 
epidemiology, synthetic biology, biosafety, and biosecurity work; 
•  computer/systems/electrical engineering for digital and 
communications technologies (i.e., 5G wireless, Blockchain, quantum 
cryptography, artificial intelligence/machine learning systems); 
•  applied math/statistics/computer science for advanced analytics/data 
science/data engineering; 
•  nuclear physics for nuclear nonproliferation, waste management, 
weapons systems analysis, radiation/nuclear detection systems, 
quantum computing; and 
•  physics/aerospace engineering for hypersonics, advanced weapons 
systems, space systems, unmanned systems. 
Based on interest expressed by various committees of jurisdiction, 
potential future work could focus on digital ledger technologies such as 
Blockchain, opioid-addiction vaccine development, autonomous vehicles, 
and regenerative medicine, among many others. Also, as we do in all 
areas, we will make our expert staff available to Members and staff to 
share knowledge and insight on technical and scientific matters. 
Consistent with the 2019 Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill, 
Conference Report, we provided a detailed plan to this committee in 
March 2019. The report outlined our expanded capabilities on science 
and technology related issues, specific plans for additional staff and other 
resources, and the products and services the Team will provide to 
Congress. The document also describes the governance structures that 
will apply to the team’s work, including technology assessments. To 
inform this plan, we conducted outreach to subject matter experts and 
Page 7  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
stakeholders. These include Members of Congress, congressional 
committees, alumni of the former Office of Technology Assessment, 
major scientific associations, the National Academies, and leading 
science and technology policy experts in universities and nonprofit 
institutions.2 
 
Federal agencies and the nation’s critical infrastructures—such as 
Addressing Complex 
energy, transportation systems, communications, and financial services—
and Growing Cyber 
are dependent on cyber information systems and electronic data to carry 
out operations and to process, maintain, and report essential information. 
Security Threats 
Our work in cybersecurity includes: 
•  Critical infrastructure protection. We work on how to protect the 
nation’s critical infrastructure—including financial markets, 
telecommunications, the national airspace system, electricity grid, and 
oil and gas pipeline sector. 
•  Federal information systems. We evaluate the cybersecurity of key 
federal agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service and the 
Department of Homeland Security. 
•  Privacy. We evaluate federal efforts to ensure the privacy of 
individuals in response to emerging technologies (such as the Internet 
of Things and artificial intelligence), the collection and use of personal 
information in the private sector through social media, and privacy in 
government programs (e.g., federal student aid and Medicare). 
We also will continue to further enhance our capacity to assess efforts to 
protect our nation from cyber threats. Specifically, we recently updated 
our cybersecurity high-risk area based on our recent evaluations. We did 
so to highlight urgent actions that are needed by federal agencies to 
ensure the cybersecurity of our nation.3 We also renamed our Information 
Technology team. Its new name, Information Technology and 
Cybersecurity (ITC), better reflects the significant body of work the team 
does on protecting federal information systems, critical infrastructure, and 
individual privacy and sensitive data from cyber threats. To reinforce 
                                                                                                                     
2 As of March 15, 2019, GAO met with more than 30 expert stakeholders. GAO plans to 
continue to meet with stakeholders throughout the remainder of FY 2019.

GAO’s cybersecurity audit capabilities, the ITC team is actively recruiting 
additional resources, including those participating in the CyberCorps 
Scholarship for Service program. The new recruits will augment our cadre 
of experts who can assess the criticality of cyber risks, both present and 
future, as well as evaluate the government’s complex and multi-faceted 
attempts to address them. 
 
Cyber-Based Threats to  The cyberattacks suffered by the Office of Personnel Management,

actors are growing in sophistication, scope, and impact. These increasing 
threats could have a serious, or even potentially catastrophic, impact. 
Attackers target increasing volumes of sensitive and Internet-accessible 
data by using ever-more powerful tools like automation, social media 
manipulation, vulnerability exploitation, and insider access to carry out 
attacks. These threats pose growing dangers for the entire federal 
government, the nation’s infrastructure and democratic processes, and 
the privacy and financial security of American citizens. 
As Congress turns to GAO for insightful analysis and advice to address 
these rapidly evolving threats, recruiting top-tier cyber talent to augment 
our current audit workforce is critical. Additional resources will allow us to 
quickly expand our audit capabilities related to key components of the 
cyber high-risk area, including evaluating efforts to protect federal 
systems, critical infrastructure, and individual privacy from cyber threats. 
Over the next two years, our planned efforts include assessing the federal 
government’s efforts to establish and implement a comprehensive 
national cyber strategy, to evaluate government-wide initiatives to 
implement continuous diagnostics and monitoring capabilities, and to 
establish effective risk management processes at federal agencies. GAO 
is also evaluating key agency capabilities for responding to security 
incidents and data breaches, as well as assessing their security postures 
through detailed vulnerability assessments of agency network defenses. 
Page 9  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our work on the protection of critical infrastructure will continue to focus 
on two areas: (1) the cybersecurity of specific sectors,4 including the 
electricity grid and the financial services and communications sectors, 
and (2) the effectiveness of the public-private partnership model as a 
framework for protecting the nation’s critical assets from cyber threats. 
As part of our work on critical assets, we are also starting work evaluating 
the cybersecurity implications of the move to 5G in the communications 
sector. Our work on the protection of individual privacy will also continue 
to focus on two areas: (1) federal efforts to protect consumers from data 
breaches and their after effect; and (2) whether federal agencies are 
applying data protection best practices when performing their own critical 
mission activities. 
 
The Department of Defense (DOD) faces significant challenges in 
Overseeing Increased 
responding to a complex and rapidly evolving national security 
Investments in the 
environment that includes instability in key regions of the world, cyber 
threats, and terrorist activities. As DOD works to sustain and advance its 
Department of 
military superiority and achieve efficiencies that can be reinvested to 
Defense 
increase readiness, it continues to undergo one of the most significant 
organizational realignments since the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986. 
As you know, in support of DOD’s mission, Congress entrusted DOD with 
considerable resources, about $686 billion in discretionary funds enacted 
in FY 2019, and Congress has directed GAO to review a broad range of 
DOD’s activities to assist Congress in its oversight of this investment. 
Since 2006, GAO’s work has resulted in 4,072 recommendations to DOD 
designed to strengthen the department’s programs and operations. These 
recommendations focus on critical challenges facing the department, 
including rebuilding readiness, managing space capabilities, 
strengthening cyber defenses, acquiring and sustaining major weapon 
systems, and addressing inefficiencies in the military health system, 
among others. 
                                                                                                                     
4 Critical infrastructure includes systems and assets so vital to the United States that 
incapacitating or destroying them would have a debilitating effect on national security. 
These critical infrastructures are grouped by the following 16 industries or “sectors”: 
chemical; commercial facilities; communications; critical manufacturing; dams; defense 
industrial base; emergency services; energy; financial services; food and agriculture; 
government facilities; health care and public health; information technology; nuclear 
reactors, materials, and waste; transportation systems; and water and wastewater 
systems. 
Page 10  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
GAO’s work has led to the designation of seven DOD areas on our High 
Risk List, including financial management, weapon systems acquisitions, 
business systems modernization, and support infrastructure 
management, as well as the government-wide personnel security 
clearance process, for which DOD has significant responsibilities. 
Collectively, our work has resulted in over $70 billion in financial benefits 
since FY 2015. For example, we identified $36 billion in financial benefits 
from improvements to DOD’s weapon systems acquisitions processes, an 
estimated $3.1 billion from improvements to DOD’s method for setting 
standard fuel prices, and $849 million through identifying unexpended 
and unobligated balances in DOD’s Military Personnel accounts. 
GAO anticipates continuing to support congressional oversight of DOD by 
testifying during congressional hearings, providing quick-turn-around 
technical assistance, and issuing special oversight publications across a 
broad range of areas. 
GAO will continue to interact extensively with committee staff on the 
Senate and House Armed Services Committees as they draft the annual 
National Defense Authorization Act, providing input on many legislative 
provisions based on GAO’s work. For example, Congress approved a 
budget reduction of $1.3 billion for the Navy’s frigate program, based on 
GAO’s finding that more knowledge was needed before contracts were 
awarded. 
GAO will also support congressional appropriators by conducting budget 
justification reviews on a variety of topics and defense operations and 
maintenance, weapon system acquisitions, personnel, and defense 
health care. GAO’s review of DOD’s 2019 research, development, and 
procurement budget request identified almost $2 billion in potential 
rescissions and reductions. GAO also will continue to issue annual “Quick 
Look” reports assessing the cost, schedule, and performance of about 80 
major defense acquisition programs, helping support the Congress in 
overseeing the department’s estimated $1.5 trillion in future spending on 
these systems. 
GAO also continues to assess DOD’s efforts to strengthen its financial 
management practices and efforts to obtain a clean opinion on its 
financial statements. DOD has never received a clean opinion on its 
financial statements, which prevents GAO from expressing an opinion on 
the consolidated financial statements of the federal government. Long-
standing weaknesses in DOD’s financial management adversely affect 
the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of its operations. The same 
Page 11  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
financial management problems that prevented DOD from being auditable 
in the past, adversely impact its operations and its ability to achieve 
broader business transformation goals. 
We anticipate a growing demand from the Congress for GAO’s work 
regarding DOD. In the last year, for example, Congress signaled a 
continued emphasis on DOD’s new Chief Management Officer as the 
driving force behind the department’s business reform efforts. We have a 
number of ongoing audits assessing DOD’s progress in this area, 
including reviewing DOD’s efforts to implement cross-functional business 
reform teams and to achieve enterprise-wide efficiencies. 
GAO will also support continued congressional interest in DOD’s efforts to 
balance current operational deployments with training and equipping 
forces capable of fulfilling the full spectrum of military operations. We will 
continue to assess DOD’s efforts to sustain its major weapon systems 
and address challenges from aging depot maintenance facilities. We will 
also review the plans, organization, and capabilities of the department’s 
cyber operations; the safety and effectiveness of the U.S. strategic 
nuclear force; and DOD’s investments in hypersonic weapons and 
associated defensive systems. We also anticipate further congressional 
interest in DOD’s long-range strike fighter and next generation air 
dominance acquisition efforts, as well as a broad array of space-based 
programs. 
Regarding DOD’s efforts to control costs, we plan to continue assessing 
the costs, schedule, and technical capabilities of the Columbia class 
nuclear submarine program. We also plan to assess DOD’s efforts to 
achieve efficiencies and reduce overlap and duplication, such as across 
its defense agencies and field activities. We will also continue to assess 
the department’s approach and methodologies for improving the 
efficiency of the military health system and determining its medical 
workforce needs. 
We will support the Congress in assessing DOD’s efforts in implementing 
other key legislative requirements, including acquisition reform legislation 
aimed at streamlining DOD’s processes for buying weapon systems. 
With the resources requested, GAO will expand our work within and 
beyond these areas, helping ensure that we address the issues most 
important to the Congress and taxpayer during this critical period for DOD 
and our country’s national defense.

Estimated at $1 trillion in FY 2018, growth in federal spending for major 
Managing Rising 
health care programs has exceeded the growth of GDP historically and is 
Health Care Costs 
projected to grow faster than the economy. These health care programs 
include Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance 
Program, along with federal subsidies for health insurance purchased 
through the marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) 
and related spending. Federal spending also supports health care for 
American Indians, veterans, service members and public health priorities, 
such as preventing and responding to infectious disease outbreaks and 
bio health threats. These federal commitments to health care programs 
are a key driver of the nation’s fiscal spending. Growth in federal 
spending on health care is driven both by increasing health care spending 
per person and by increasing enrollment, in part stemming from the aging 
of the population. 
The federal government faces challenges in effectively and efficiently 
managing health care programs. Specifically, the demands to meet 
Americans’ health needs are growing in volume and complexity while 
oversight is becoming more challenging. Understanding these 
complexities and offering fact-based recommendations to address them 
requires advanced policy and analytical expertise. Congress has 
frequently sought our health care policy expertise on a range of health 
care issues. In 2018, we issued 85 products that examined access to and 
quality of care, drug availability and pricing, program expenditures and 
integrity, the protection of public health, and health care markets, among 
other topics. We made 123 recommendations to improve the efficiency 
and effectiveness of federal health care spending, and documented about 
$40 billion in savings in 2018 alone by agencies taking action on our 
recommendations. 
GAO has also focused on health care issues through its biennial High 
Risk Report. With our 2017 High Risk Update, we designated the Indian 
Health Service (IHS) as high-risk. This area joins four other high-risk 
areas related to health care: Medicare, Medicaid, the Food and Drug 
Administration, and Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Health Care. 
In addition to these audit products, we annually respond to dozens of 
requests for informal assistance regarding federal health care policy and 
programs. The demand for this type of assistance continued in 2018, as 
committees considered evolving and complex health care policy changes. 
These requests ranged from making our subject matter experts available 
to answer detailed questions about the interworking of programs to 
providing time-sensitive data analysis. 
Page 13  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our health care policy experts also advise me on my statutory 
responsibilities for appointing members to six different health-related 
commissions.5 Carefully considering each appointment to these 
commissions requires a high-degree of professional judgment and subject 
matter expertise and demands a significant investment of time by our 
health care senior executives. 
Additional resources for our health care work would not only allow us to 
respond more quickly to congressional requests, it would allow us to 
expand our work on the drivers of health care costs. For example, the 
continued growth of the Medicare and Medicaid programs drives federal 
spending on health care and these programs are expected to place 
additional strain on the federal budget in the coming years, as each 
program is projected to top $1 trillion in annual expenditures within the 
next decade. 
With decades of experience, our expertise positions us to examine the 
growth of Medicare spending relative to other components of the health 
care system (e.g., inpatient and post-acute care) and ask which is 
growing higher and faster. Our expertise also positions us to examine the 
incentives created by certain Medicare payment policies that drive excess 
and inappropriate utilization of services. Furthermore, our staff’s Medicaid 
expertise positions us to explore issues like access, financing 
arrangements, delivery, and program integrity, all critical issues that are 
made more complex by the variation among state Medicaid programs. 
In addition to examining the sustainability of these large federal health 
care programs, we would continue to examine how these health care 
programs and markets affect the daily lives of Americans and 
communities. For example, given: 
•  The complexities of the prescription drug market, we would continue 
to provide objective, unbiased examinations of trends in drug costs 
and identify options to control these costs. 
                                                                                                                     
5 GAO has responsibility for appointing members to six health care commissions, including 
the Health Information Technology Advisory Committee; Medicaid and CHIP Payment 
and Access Commission; Medicare Payment Advisory Commission; Patient-Centered 
Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) Governing Board; PCORI Methodology 
Committee; and the Physician-Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee.

Information Technology. GAO has a range of business applications, 
many of which rely on outdated technologies. A multi-year, multi-phase 
effort to improve our aging IT infrastructure is underway. This effort will 
allow us to further streamline business operations, increase staff 
efficiency and productivity, improve access to information, and facilitate a 
more agile and mobile workforce, all in a more secure environment. This 
modernization effort will include several components, some of which are 
discussed below. 
In FY 2019 and FY 2020, we will: 
•  Continue our efforts to modernize content development, distribution, 
and publishing our reports. This effort, New Blue, will allow our reports 
to be formatted for and consumed on any internet-connected device.

staff on New Blue has been very positive, specifically, the ability to 
access GAO products remotely for use during congressional hearings. 
•  Finish rolling out cloud-based technology to provide enhanced Unified 
Communication Tools (UCT) and collaboration capabilities within 
GAO for an increasingly mobile workforce. UCT supports our mobile

workforce / virtual presence goals to reduce the need for travel among 
field offices and headquarters, in addition to audit locations. This effort 
will modernize our suite of telecommunications tools, which will 
facilitate greater video conferencing, audio, data sharing, reduce 
redundant implementation and maintenance costs, and standardize 
the infrastructure that supports voice and data usage. In addition, this 
effort will migrate telecommunications infrastructure to a cloud hosted 
solution, which will reduce expenditures and fully integrate with 
enhanced collaboration tools. 
•  Deploy a cloud-based Web Content Management solution for GAO’s 
external web site, www.gao.gov, which will better enable mobile 
content and increase customer satisfaction. 
•  Upgrade the virtual desktop infrastructure7 to be more responsive to 
staff needs and better enable staff to conduct analysis and develop 
content. This effort will include upgrading the operating environment 
on our desktops to Windows 10 prior to Windows 7 being sunset in 
2020. 
•  Implement software enhancements to automate and improve how 
GAO receives complaints regarding fraud, waste, and abuse through 
GAO’s Fraudnet portal. 
•  Define the requirements to replace our decades old document and 
records management system, which houses the supporting 
documentation for our audit engagements and operational support 
programs. We are looking to move to a cloud-based Enterprise 
Content Management solution that provides enhanced functionality, 
including security, knowledge management, workflow automation, and 
business process management. 
This solution will improve existing document and records management 
capabilities, and will do so with less administrative burden on employees. 
In addition, the solution will radically improve our ability to share 
knowledge across the agency and automate many routine workflows for 
engagement management and execution as well as for internal 
operations. This will free staff to focus their energies on content 
development and client and customer service. We expect to acquire and 
begin implementation of the solution in FY 2020.

•  Replace the agency’s outdated Learning Management and 
Performance Management systems with a cloud-based Talent 
Management information system to track and manage training and 
development activities of GAO staff. 
We also plan to expand our IT capacity to meet the demands of a larger 
GAO staff and support the new STAA Team and Audit Innovation Lab. 
Facilities and Security. While most of GAO’s staff is located at its 
Headquarters in Washington, DC, GAO maintains a presence in strategic 
locations throughout the country. GAO is always working to ensure our 
headquarters and field office locations operate as efficiently as possible, 
and we continue to reduce our real property footprint as we identify 
opportunities. 
In FY 2018, GAO consolidated space in its headquarters building to 
maximize efficiency, freeing up over 40,000 square feet for use by 
another federal agency and increasing GAO’s rental income. In a further 
effort to cut costs and reduce our real estate footprint, GAO is 
strategically moving its field offices into federally owned space as 
commercial leases expire. For example, GAO recently moved its San 
Francisco Office from a commercial lease in the financial district to a 
federal building in Oakland. 
Over the next two years, GAO is also looking at options to relocate staff in 
Los Angeles and Chicago from commercial buildings. GAO is requesting 
additional funding related to these office moves to ensure we have 
funding needed for fixed costs related to moves and other expenses 
related to the office transitions. In addition, as reported in our FY 2018 
financial statements, GAO has over $29 million of deferred but necessary 
maintenance at its headquarters building. This includes heating and air 
conditioning infrastructure and major electrical equipment that are original 
to our 67-year old building and past their useful life. Additional funds will 
help enable this work and protect these valuable assets from quickening 
deterioration. 
Increased Classified Work. In recent years, GAO has received an 
increasing number of mandates and congressional requests for reviews 
that require GAO staff to have access to classified agency information, as 
well as reviews that require accessing information at higher classification 
levels. Further, GAO’s Procurement Law division hears bid protests that 
involve classified information as part of its statutory responsibility for 
adjudicating bid protests of government contracts. 
Page 17  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Given this increased demand, GAO began making corresponding 
infrastructure investments in FY 2017 and FY 2018. For example, GAO 
has increased the size of its secure space available in its headquarters 
for processing classified information at both the Secret and Top Secret 
and Sensitive Compartmented Information levels. 
Additional funds in FY 2020 will help enable GAO to make further cost-
effective technological and infrastructure improvements to support the 
anticipated increase in work involving classified information, such as 
•  upgrading and deploying additional secure video teleconference 
equipment for field offices; 
•  a new case management system to more efficiently track personnel 
security clearances; 
•  a new Classified Enterprise Content Management solution to enhance 
processing of classified products; and 
•  networked Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information 
computer processing capabilities. 
 
GAO continues to be recognized for its non-partisan, objective, fact-
Assisting the 
based, and professional analyses across the full breadth and scope of the 
Congress in Shaping 
federal government’s responsibilities and the extensive interests of 
Congress. 
Legislation 
Since our last budget request, Congress used GAO’s work to make 
important legislative decisions. Examples linked directly to GAO’s work 
include: 
•  The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. Based on GAO 
work, Congress directs: 
•  DOD to (1) mitigate the effects of flooding on roads and 
infrastructure on domestic installations that are vital to military 
operations; and (2) improve oversight of its global real property 
portfolio; 
•  VA to (1) modernize and improve its appeals process; (2) improve 
the accuracy and fairness of Gulf War illness claims; (3) retrofit 
facilities to eliminate barriers to care for women veterans; (4) 
report on progress to improve oversight of the controlled 
Page 18  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
substance inspection program; and (5) improve staffing, 
recruitment, and retention strategies for physicians; 
•  DOE to (1) better account for fraudulent spending or other 
improper payments; (2) improve contract auditing and the tracking 
of meaningful data for fraud, waste, and abuse in its contracts; 
and (3) improve the Office of River Protection’s ability to carry out 
oversight of its contractors’ quality assurance programs. 
•  The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. 
Reflecting our past work, the Congress directs DOD to: 
•  develop a plan to rebuild military readiness in 5 warfighting 
domains, including ground, air, sea, space, and cyberspace, as 
well as requiring GAO to annually review the department’s plan 
through 2022; 
•  provide military service members with training to enhance their 
employability within one year prior to their separation, and improve 
related performance reporting and monitoring; 
•  require the Navy to provide detailed budget information for multi-
billion dollar aircraft carrier dismantlement and disposal activities; 
and 
•  require the Secretary of Defense to designate a component 
responsible for coordinating efforts to acquire a modernized 
Global Positioning System receiver, to maximize the government’s 
return on a multi-billion dollar investment. 
•  In addition, a House report accompanying the Act directs DOD to: 
•  use policy and technological solutions to manage risk and secure 
classified information and systems to counter insider threats; and 
•  urge the Secretary of the Air Force and Secretary of the Navy, in 
concert with the F-35 Joint Program Office, to reduce F-35 
sustainment costs. 
•  The Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act (GAO-IG 
Act). Signed into law on January 3, 2019, the act requires certain 
federal agencies: 
•  to include a report in their annual budget justification that identifies 
the implementation status of each public GAO recommendation 
Page 19  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
that has been outstanding for at least one year and that not been 
implemented.8 
•  The 2018 Omnibus Appropriations Act. Based on GAO’s work, the 
Congress directs: 
•  the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to research the 
overmedication of veterans that led to deaths, suicides, and 
mental health disorders; 
•  DOD to align its (1) structure, (2) statutory parameters, and (3) 
regulatory 
guidance across federal prescription drug buying programs to 
increase its buying power and reduce costs; 
•  DHS to (1) develop performance metrics for all deployed border 
security, (2) evaluate the individual and collective effect of 
deployed technologies, and (3) assess progress; 
•  DHS to regularly assess advanced protective technologies for 
cybersecurity; and 
•  federal agencies, such as DOD, National Cybersecurity and 
Communications Center, and Bureau of Indian Affairs, to report on 
how they plan to implement GAO recommendations. 
•  The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. 
Reflecting our past work, the Congress directs DOD to: 
•  improve its budget guidelines, cost savings, leadership of 
business operations, military readiness goals and implementation 
strategies, and reduce vulnerabilities in military aircraft and risks 
to military installations from climate change; 
•  increase reporting on the Columbia class nuclear submarine to 
keep the program on track; 
•  change its space leadership structure; 
•  reinstate annual reports on the time required to conduct 
investigations, adjudicate cases, and grant security clearances; 
and 
•  establish new ways for agencies to modernize their legacy 
information technology.

•  The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018. In October 2018, 
based in part on GAO’s work, Congress passed the 2018 Disaster 
Recovery Reform Act, which directs the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) to: 
•  develop a National Public Infrastructure Pre-Disaster Mitigation 
fund to allow for a greater investment in building resilience before 
a disaster occurs; 
•  make federal disaster assistance available to state and local 
governments for building code administration and enforcement; 
•  reconsider the factors it uses to evaluate a jurisdiction’s request 
for a major federal disaster declaration; and 
•  update Congress on the development of a national preparedness 
assessment and efforts to avoid duplication across preparedness 
grants. 
Federal funding for disaster assistance since 2005 is approaching half a 
trillion dollars (about $430 billion), most recently for hurricanes and 
wildfires in 2017 and 2018. These costs are expected to increase as 
extreme weather events become more frequent and intense. Increasing 
reliance on federal assistance is a key source of federal fiscal exposure. 
Since adding limiting the federal government’s exposure by better 
managing climate change risks to our High Risk List in 2013, we have 
made several recommendations to help improve resilience to potential 
disasters. 
 
Financial and  Financial Benefits. In FY 2018, financial benefits resulting from our work 
included (1) revising spending limits for Medicaid demonstration projects 
Program Benefits 
to assure that they are budget-neutral ($36.8 billion); (2) helping the 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) achieve and measure 
the benefits of its fraud prevention system ($1.3 billion); (3) identifying 
unexpended and unobligated balances in selected DOD accounts and 
proposing changes in its fuel pricing methodology ($5.3 billion); and (4) 
identifying unexpended and unobligated balances in DOD’s Military 
Personnel accounts ($849 million). 
Other Benefits. Many other benefits resulting from our work led to 
program and operational improvements. In FY 2018, we recorded 1,294 
of these other benefits. For example, our work on public safety and 
security: 
Page 21  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  positioned U.S. Customs and Border Protection to better protect U.S. 
manufacturers from economic harm and U.S. consumers from 
potential risks posed by counterfeit products sold online; 
•  resulted in comprehensive ready-for-sea inspections of Navy ships 
based in Japan and changes to sleep schedules after deadly 
collisions in the Pacific highlighted training, maintenance, and 
manning shortfalls that had contributed to insufficient sleep time for 
sailors; 
•  led the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to begin updating 
and improving the risk assessment and strategy it uses to (1) secure 
airport perimeters, and (2) control access to restricted areas to better 
assess security issues at airports nationwide; and 
•  prompted the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of National 
Drug Control Policy to begin developing results-oriented measures, 
such as reductions in overdose deaths, to help them assess progress 
made in combatting the nation’s opioid epidemic. 
Similarly, our work related to vulnerable populations: 
•  contributed to the Congress passing legislation to strengthen the 
nation’s data on elder abuse by requiring annual data collection and 
reporting to support national prevention policy; and 
•  led the Federal Communications Commission to begin measuring the 
effectiveness of industry efforts to prevent wireless network outages 
helping to ensure that Americans who rely solely on them have 
access during emergencies. 
In addition, our work in the health care area: 
•  prompted the Indian Health Service (HIS) to publish wait-time 
standards for primary care and urgent care visits to help it monitor 
patient access to care; 
•  led CMS to establish regular checks for identifying duplicate health 
coverage in both Medicaid and the health insurance exchange 
marketplaces, thereby helping to minimize the risk of the federal 
government paying twice for an individual’s health insurance 
coverage; and 
Page 22  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  prompted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug 
Enforcement Administration to formalize procedures for sharing 
information that would allow FDA to better manage drug shortages. 
Furthermore, our work in the area of agency operations: 
•  led FEMA to (1) pilot a data sharing process with states to allow it to 
identify potentially duplicative disaster assistance payments, and (2) 
make plans to create a similar process to manage future disasters; 
•  prompted the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to issue 
formal guidance and implementation guidelines to help federal 
agencies continually assess their employees’ eligibility to hold security 
clearances and to do so uniformly; and 
•  prompted the Congress to require federal agencies to inform active 
duty military service members of their eligibility to receive student 
loans at a 6 percent interest rate to better ensure timely access to 
these loans and prevent overpayments. 
 
The Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 
Evaluating Federal 
2017 provided GAO with $14 million to conduct unanticipated disaster 
Disaster Response 
oversight and audit work associated with the catastrophic hurricanes and 
wildfires in 2017. GAO is evaluating a variety of topics including disaster 
and Recovery Issues 
contracting, response challenges, progress in multiple federal recovery 
programs, fraud prevention and internal controls, and is identifying 
recommendations to improve federal actions in all these areas. 
So far, GAO has completed 11 disaster-related reports and has 25 
additional ongoing audit engagements. Specifically, we have reported on 
the initial federal efforts to respond to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and 
Maria, as well as the California wildfires. We have also reported on 
disaster-related federal spending and identified a number of long-term 
recovery challenges in disaster-impacted areas, such as Puerto Rico and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. Further, we identified challenges related to 
FEMA’s disaster workforce and recommended actions to address 
weaknesses in federal disaster contracting practices.

Figure 2: Damaged Power Lines and Satellite Dish in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in November 2017 
 
In regard to ongoing work, we are evaluating disaster recovery programs 
for individuals and those with disabilities, efforts to strengthen disaster 
resilience and better prepare for future disasters, and efforts to restore 
the power grid in Puerto Rico, among other issues. Given the number of 
ongoing engagements and our reporting schedule, we anticipate that 
GAO will use all of the $14 million in disaster funds by the end of FY 
2020. A complete list of the reports issued and audits currently underway 
is included as Enclosure II.

Through the products we issued in FY 2018, we continued to build on 
Building Bodies of 
bodies of work related to our three broad strategic goals to (1) address 
Knowledge 
current and emerging challenges to the well-being and financial security 
of the American people; (2) help the Congress respond to changing 
security threats and the challenges of global interdependence; and (3) 
help transform the federal government to address national challenges. 
Examples include: 
•  Protection of children. We reported on the need to (1) improve 
federal support to help states recruit and retain foster care families to 
meet demand; (2) develop guidance for states to help them better 
apply protections for substance-affected infants; (3) consider 
discipline disparities for Black students, boys, and students with 
disabilities in K-12 public schools; and (4) update guidance to better 
monitor lead in school drinking water. 
Page 25  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Support of Veterans. We reported on the need for VA to improve its 
oversight and evaluation of the effectiveness of its suicide prevention 
outreach activities. We found that VA’s outreach activities dropped off 
in 2017 and 2018, and the office responsible for these activities 
lacked consistent leadership. We also found that VA did not have 
clear goals for evaluating the effectiveness of its outreach activities. 
We also reported on the need for (1) DOD to improve its monitoring of 
and reporting on its transitioning veterans program; (2) VA to further 
assess its performance and progress toward meeting its opioid safety 
goals for veterans; and (3) VHA to collect better data and evaluate its 
strategies for improving physician staffing, recruitment, and retention. 
•  Advancement of health care. We reported on the need to (1) better 
secure the electronic health information of Medicare beneficiaries; (2) 
improve federal oversight of the health and welfare of beneficiaries 
receiving Medicaid assisted living services; and (3) improve 
assessments of individuals’ needs for home and community based 
services. 
•  Oversight of military readiness. We continued to monitor DOD’s 
efforts to rebuild military readiness and reported on the need to (1) 
better plan for sustaining various military aircraft, including the new F-
35; (2) reassess the utilization and organization of the Air Force F-22 
Raptor fleet; (3) improve maintenance of the Navy’s submarine fleet 
and the Army’s Patriot missile defense system; and (4) clarify policies 
and gather reliable data to manage the impact of time away from 
home on service members and their families. 
•  Assessment of technology and science. We reported on (1) 
Artificial Intelligence applications in four areas – cybersecurity, 
automated vehicles, criminal justice, and financial services; (2) 
sustainable chemical innovation, new approaches that improve the 
chemistry behind medicines, personal care products, and other 
everyday items to reduce environmental impacts; (3) technologies to 
mitigate electromagnetic risks to the U.S. electric grid; and (4) 
quantum computing, synthetic biology, and other potentially 
transformational research and considerations for U.S. 
competitiveness. 
•  Designation of High Risk areas. In our latest March 2019 update, 
the ratings for seven areas improved, two to the point of coming off 
the list—Department of Defense Supply Chain Management and 
Mitigating Gaps in Weather Satellite Data. The rankings for more than 
Page 26  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
half of the over 30 areas on the list remained largely unchanged with 
three regressing. We also added VA Acquisition Management to the 
list after identifying seven VA contracting challenges. VA has one of 
the most significant acquisition functions in the federal government, in 
costs and numbers of contracts. Another issue—the Government-
wide Personnel Security Clearance Process—was added to the list in 
January 2018 due to growing concerns about security clearance 
backlogs and other problems. 
In FY 2018, our high-risk work in 35 areas resulted in 166 reports, 49 
testimonies, $46.8 billion in financial benefits, and 526 other benefits. 
Financial benefits to the federal government due to progress in 
addressing high-risk areas over the past 13 years (fiscal year 2006 
through fiscal year 2018) totaled nearly $350 billion or an average of 
about $27 billion per year. The updated list is included as Enclosure I. 
•  Identification of Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication. Our 
eighth annual report identified 68 new actions across 23 new program 
areas that could reduce fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, or 
provide other cost savings and revenue enhancement opportunities 
across the federal government. Congress and executive branch 
agencies addressed 724 of the actions identified from 2011 to 2017, 
leading to about $178 billion in financial benefits; $125 billion had 
accrued through 2017, with $53 billion more expected. An updated 
Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication report will be issued May 
2019. 
 
Serving Our Clients. In FY 2018, we issued 633 reports and made 1,650 
Focusing on 
new recommendations. Our senior executives were asked to testify 98 
Congressional 
times before 48 separate committees or subcommittees on topics 
including key risks for the 2020 Census, improper payments under 
Priorities 
Medicaid, national defense preparedness, border security, and the 
nation’s cybersecurity challenges. The table that follows lists examples of 
topics GAO addressed in testimony in FY 2018, grouped by our three 
external strategic goals.

Outreach Efforts. I continued my regular meetings with the Chairs and 
Ranking Members of congressional committees to obtain their views on 
GAO’s work, including their priorities, and to discuss opportunities and 
challenges facing our nation. 
I also sent letters to the heads of most federal departments to 
acknowledge the actions taken to date to implement our prior 
Page 28  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendations and to draw their attention to priority recommendations 
still requiring their attention. These letters were also sent to the 
congressional committees of jurisdiction to inform their oversight. 
We continue to collaborate with the Congress to revise or repeal 
mandated reporting requirements to align our work with current 
congressional priorities and maximize our staff resources. 
 
Internal  Supporting Our People. The hard work and dedication of our diverse 
and professional multidisciplinary staff positioned GAO to achieve 97 
Improvements 
percent on-time delivery of our products in FY 2018. We exceeded the 
targets for our seven people measures, new hire rate, retention rates with 
and without retirements, staff development, staff utilization, effective 
leadership by supervisors, and organizational climate. GAO also 
continued its distinction as a best place to work—the Partnership for 
Public Service ranked GAO fourth among mid-size federal agencies and 
first for supporting diversity. 
Managing Our Internal Operations. In fiscal year 2018, we continued 
efforts to maximize our strategic goal to maximize our value by enabling 
quality, timely service to the Congress and being a leading practices 
federal agency. We made progress addressing our three internal 
management challenges: managing a quality workforce; improving the 
efficiency of our engagements; and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, 
and availability of GAO’s information technology services. We are on 
track to achieve 3,150 FTE in our FY 2019 hiring plan and expect to have 
over 3,250 staff on board at year-end. 
In FY 2018 GAO deployed the Electronic Protest Docketing System 
(EPDS), made key security investments, and refreshed technology 
platforms needed to support our bid protest work. 9 
As previously mentioned, in FY 2019, we will complete the pilot of New 
Blue, a system that will allow analysts to more efficiently create and 
manage report content; streamline the publishing processes; and enable 
access on mobile devices. New Blue is planned to be rolled out across 
                                                                                                                     
9 The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, included a provision for GAO to develop an 
electronic bid protest filing system.  The statute also authorized the collection and use of 
fees to offset the costs of that system. GAO successfully piloted and launched its new 
system, EPDS, in 2018.

reviewing a GAO product in the new format, please see GAO-18-312. 
To enhance information technology services, we continued to strengthen 
monitoring and detection of malicious activity to counter escalating 
cybersecurity threats. 
In keeping with our effort to continuously improve our operations, GAO 
migrated to the Legislative Branch Financial Management System 
(LBFMS) Momentum Financial operated by the Library of Congress. The 
system serves as our integrated Financial Management System and is 
hosted in a FedRAMP compliant and secure facility. LBFMS improved 
internal controls over invoicing processing, reduced data entry errors, and 
increased efficiency and timeliness of payments. 
GAO also received an unmodified or “clean” opinion from independent 
auditors on our financial statements for FY 2018 and our internal control 
over financial reporting. Independent auditors found no reportable 
noncompliance with provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, 
and grant agreements tested. We demonstrated that all detailed 
performance and financial information is complete and reliable and meets 
high standards for accuracy and transparency. 
 
Good Accounting  With regard to the recommendations from GAO’s Office of the Inspector 
General (OIG), GAO has implemented all of the recommendations issued 
Obligation in 
by the OIG prior to January 2018. Additionally, GAO has determined that 
it will implement the three open OIG recommendations that have been 
Government Act 
issued within the past 12 months and expects that implementation will be 
Reporting 
completed within calendar year 2019. 
 
Legal Work  In FY 2018, we addressed about 2,600 bid protest cases and issued 
more than 600 decisions on the merits. In addition, we published 15 
appropriations law products, including five products to carry out GAO’s 
responsibilities under the Impoundment Control Act regarding the 
President’s special message of May 2018. 
 
Strategic Planning  GAO issued its latest Strategic Plan for Serving the Congress and the 
Nation in February 2018, covering FYs 2018 to 2023. As the nation 
confronts a series of both new and long-standing challenges, this plan 
describes our goals and strategies to support the Congress to identify 
Page 30  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
cost savings and other financial opportunities; to make government more 
accountable, efficient and effective; and ultimately to improve the safety, 
security, and well-being of the American people. GAO’s Strategic Plan 
provides a comprehensive roadmap for how the agency will support the 
most important priorities of Congress and the American people. 
This plan reflects the full scope of the federal government’s operations, as 
well as emerging and future trends that may affect government and 
society. As part of our strategic planning process, we emphasize 
foresight, continuous environmental scanning, and trend analysis as 
essential to helping inform our decision-making and long-term planning. 
The plan is comprised of three sections: strategic goals and objectives; 
key efforts; and trends that provide overall context supporting our long-
range planning. The current strategic plan framework (Enclosure III) 
summarizes these global trends affecting government and society, as well 
as the strategic goals and objectives that guide our work. 
There are eight trend areas in GAO’s 2018 – 2023 plan including: 
1.  Domestic and Global Security: Global conditions affecting U.S. and 
international security; 
2.  Fiscal Outlook and the Debt: The federal government’s long-term 
unsustainable fiscal path; 
3.  Economics and Trade: Global response to challenges posed by 
divergent economic growth; 
4.  Jobs and Education: Technological advances and their impact on 
preparing the workforce of the future; 
5.  Demographics and Society: Demographic changes and their 
implications for U.S. society and economy; 
6.  Science and Technology: Five emerging technologies and scientific 
advances that could potentially transform society (Genome Editing; 
Artificial Intelligence and Automation; Quantum Information Science; 
Brain/Augmented Reality; and Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain); 
7.  Government and Governance: Increasingly complex governance 
relationships and practices; and 
8.  Environment and Sustainability: Balancing competing natural 
resource and sustainability needs.

The Congress authorized GAO to establish a Center for Audit Excellence 
Center for Audit 
(the Center) in 2014 to provide training and technical assistance to 
Excellence 
enhance the capacity of domestic and international accountability 
organizations. GAO contributes to a number of efforts that promote good 
governance and enhance the capacity of the accountability community. 
The Center uniquely offers a wide range of training and technical 
assistance services at locations throughout the United States and the 
world. The Center is authorized to charge fees for its services to facilitate 
recovery of its costs. 
Since its opening in October 2015, the Center has expanded its volume of 
business significantly and increased annual revenue from $41,000 in fees 
in FY 2016 to $624,000 in FY 2018. Further, the Center has provided 
training or technical assistance services to over two dozen federal, state, 
local and international accountability organizations. Several of these 
organizations have returned to the Center repeatedly for training and 
technical assistance services to help build staff capacity in applying 
auditing concepts and tools. 
In FY 2018, the Center provided training and technical assistance to 12 
domestic audit organizations, including federal inspectors general and 
state and local audit offices. Center services helped these organizations 
improve their staff members’ understanding of federal internal control 
standards, Government Auditing Standards, and performance audit 
methodologies. For example, the Center provided 10 classes on internal 
control to one federal audit organization. Based on formal and informal 
feedback, the vast majority of training participants found Center training to 
be greatly useful. 
The Center also provided technical assistance to three national audit 
institutions in Europe and Central America during FY 2018 to enhance 
their capacity to conduct and achieve results from performance audits. 
For example, the Center helped a national audit institution in Eastern 
Europe enhance its capacity to conduct information technology audits and 
helped another national audit institution assess and improve its process 
for documenting financial benefits resulting from audits. The Center also 
provided technical assistance on a project funded by the Millennium 
Challenge Corporation to help enhance the performance audit capacity of 
a national audit institution in Central America. 
In April 2016, the Center signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to 
collaborate in enhancing audit capacity and accountability in developing 
Page 32  GAO-19-451T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
countries. In FY 2018, under the MOU, the Center assessed the capacity 
building needs of an African country’s audit institutions for USAID and 
identified areas for improvement. In November 2018, the Center signed 
an agreement with USAID/Philippines to provide training and technical 
assistance services to the Philippine Commission on Audit to strengthen 
their capacity to conduct performance audits. USAID expects the total 
estimated cost of the 3-year project to be $1.48 million and has obligated 
$500,000 for services to be provided by the Center in the first year. 
The Center continues to implement its business plan and look for 
additional ways to build on its accomplishments and strengthen the 
capacity of accountability partners to enhance the oversight of U.S. 
federal funds used domestically and across the globe. For example, 
during FY 2019, the Center plans to expand its international work further 
by leveraging its MOU with USAID and expanding partnerships with other 
organizations such as the World Bank. 
 
Concluding Remarks  We value the opportunity to provide Congress and the nation with timely, 
insightful analysis on the challenges facing the country. I would like to 
thank the Committee again for its support of GAO and the FY 2019 
Budget. Our FY 2020 budget requests the resources to ensure that we 
can continue to address the highest priorities of the Congress. 
Our request will allow us to continue building our staffing level and 
provide our employees with the appropriate resources and support 
needed to serve the Congress effectively. This funding level will also 
allow us to continue efforts to promote operational efficiency and address 
long-deferred information technology investments and maintenance. We 
will also continue to explore opportunities to generate revenue to help 
offset our costs. 
I appreciate, as always, your careful consideration of GAO’s budget and 
your continued support.

WRITTEN STATEMENT  
OF 
 
MR. R.D. JAMES 
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE ARMY 
FOR CIVIL WORKS 
 
 
BEFORE  
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT 
UNITED STATES SENATE 
 
ON  
 
THE FISCAL YEAR 2020 BUDGET  
FOR THE CIVIL WORKS PROGRAM  
OF THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS 
 
APRIL 10, 2019 
 
 
 
1 
 
Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Feinstein, and distinguished members of 
the committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss the 
President’s Budget for the Civil Works program of the Army Corps of Engineers. 
 
The Fiscal Year 2020 Budget provides over $4.8 billion for the Army Civil Works 
program, with a focus on investments that will yield high economic and 
environmental returns or address a significant risk to public safety.  This Budget 
relies on a foundation of strong relationships between the Corps and local 
communities, which allow us to work together to help manage, develop, restore, 
and protect their water resources. The Budget focuses on the highest performing 
work within the three main missions of the Corps: 
 
•  commercial navigation,  
•  flood and coastal storm damage reduction, and  
•  aquatic ecosystem restoration. 
 
The FY 2020 Budget includes approximately $2.4 billion for the study, design, 
construction, operation and maintenance of inland and coastal navigation 
projects.  The Budget gives priority to coastal harbors and inland waterways with 
the most commercial traffic.  It also provides for the maintenance of channels at 
small ports, with emphasis on those that support significant commercial fishing, 
subsistence, or public transportation benefits. 
 
The Flood Risk Management program is funded at approximately $1.2 billion in 
the Budget and includes funding to provide technical and planning assistance to 
local communities to enable them to understand and to better manage their flood 
risks.  The Budget assists these local efforts, with emphasis on non-structural 
approaches.   
The Budget provides $187 million to restore several large ecosystems that have 
been a focus of interagency collaboration and to support restoring aquatic 
habitat in ecosystems where the aquatic ecosystem structure, function, and 
processes have degraded.   
 
These investments will enable communities to facilitate waterborne 
transportation, reduce their flood risk, and restore significant aquatic 
ecosystems.   
 
The Budget supports a Corps program that has a diverse set of tools and 
approaches to working with local communities, whether this means funding 
projects with our cost-sharing partners, providing planning assistance and 
technical expertise to help communities make better informed decisions, or 
participating in the national and international conversations on how to best 
2 
 
address our water resources challenges.  The Budget helps us maintain and 
improve our efforts on resiliency and sustainability – one of the challenges 
associated with the ways that we have used our water resources.  
 
The Budget also focuses on maintaining the vast water resources infrastructure 
that the Corps owns and manages and on finding innovative ways to rehabilitate 
it or hand it over to others.  
 
These goals will be met by funding capital investment in the inland waterways, 
and reforming the way that we finance these investments.  Our proposal includes 
establishing an annual fee that will support infrastructure investment and 
economic growth by helping finance the users’ share of future capital investment, 
as well as 10 percent of the operation and maintenance cost, associated with 
these waterways.  The Budget once again proposes to divest the Washington 
Aqueduct, which is the wholesale water supply system for Washington, D.C.; 
Arlington County, Virginia; the City of Falls Church, Virginia; and parts of Fairfax 
County, Virginia.  
 
The Budget proposes revisions to the appropriations language for the 
Construction, Operation and Maintenance, and Mississippi River and Tributaries 
accounts and the Harbor Maintenance and Inland Waterways Trust Funds to 
enable greater transparency and accountability in how these funds are budgeted 
and spent.  The Press Book, which you have before you, reflects this by 
displaying the total account and project funding levels derived from each of these 
trust funds. 
 
The Budget promotes increased non-Federal participation in the construction of 
Civil Works projects to improve project delivery and to increase cost savings.  It 
includes $150 million in the Construction account for the WRRDA 2014 Section 
1043 Non-Federal Construction of Federal Projects program.  The Corps would 
transfer this funding to non-Federal sponsors who have decided to construct an 
authorized project on their own under Section 1043 of WRRDA 2014, as amended. 
The Budget also proposes to extend this program’s authorization, which 
currently expires on June 10, 2019. The Budget also provides $150 million in the 
Construction account for the Innovative Funding Partnerships program.  These 
funds would be used, in conjunction with funds voluntarily provided by non-
Federal interests in excess of the non-Federal sponsor’s statutory cost share 
requirements, to accelerate the completion of construction of authorized projects.   
 
In addition, the budget proposes to return responsibility for management of the 
Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) back to the 
Department of Energy.  The Army Corps would continue to perform cleanup of 
FUSRAP sites on a reimbursable basis with DOE.  Consolidation of FUSRAP with 
3 
 
the other DOE federal cleanup programs under a single agency will allow DOE to 
consider a broader range of federal cleanup responsibilities in prioritizing work 
each fiscal year and result in efficiencies for taxpayers. 
 
The FY 2020 Investigations program is funded at $82 million in the Budget, 
including $5 million from the Mississippi River and Tributaries (MR&T) account, 
of which $26 million is to fund studies to determine the need, engineering 
feasibility, and economic, environmental and social return of potential solutions 
for water and related land resources problems.   
 
The Investigations account includes funding to complete one preconstruction 
engineering and design (Mobile Harbor, AL), and three dredged material 
management plans (Buffalo Harbor, NY, Cleveland Harbor, OH and Corpus Christi 
Ship Channel, TX).   
 
The FY 2020 Construction program includes a total of $1.3 billion.  This includes 
funding for nine commercial navigation projects, five aquatic ecosystem 
restoration projects and programs, and four flood risk management projects.  The 
construction program uses objective, performance-based guidelines to allocate 
funding toward the highest performing economic, environmental, and public 
safety investments.  
 
Four construction projects are funded to completion in the FY 2020 Budget.  They 
include three commercial navigation projects – Charleston Harbor, SC; Locks and 
Dams 2, 3 and 4, Monongahela River, PA; and Melvin Price Lock and Dam, IL & 
MO; and one aquatic ecosystem restoration project – Mud Mountain Dam, WA. 
 
The FY 2020 O&M program is funded at $3 billion.  For O&M, the Budget 
emphasizes performance of existing projects by focusing on those coastal 
harbors and inland waterways with the most commercial traffic.  The allocation of 
funding for maintenance among projects reflects a risk-informed approach that 
considers both project and project component conditions and the potential 
consequences of a failure. The Budget also makes important investments in the 
O&M program to promote the sustainable management of the lands around Corps 
facilities, by providing funds to update the plans that govern how we manage our 
facilities and helping to combat invasive species.   
 
The Budget proposes to derive $965 million from the Harbor Maintenance Trust 
Fund to maintain coastal channels and related work, and $55.5 million from the 
Inland Waterways Trust Fund to complete the Locks and Dams 2, 3, and 4, project 
on the Lower Monongahela River.   
 
4 
 
The FY 2020 Regulatory Program is funded at $200 million to protect the nation’s 
waters and wetlands and provide efficiency in permit processing. 
 
Lastly, the Budget provides a total of $32 million for the Emergency Management 
program, a robust level of funding to help ensure that our people are properly 
trained and equipped, so that they will be able to help communities respond to a 
flood or other disaster. 
 
Thank you all for inviting me here today.  I look forward to your questions.

Statement of Attorney General William P. Barr 
Before the Subcommittee on  
Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies 
Committee on Appropriations 
United States Senate 
April 10, 2019 
   
 
Good morning, Chairman Moran, Ranking Member Shaheen, and other distinguished 
Members of the Subcommittee.  I am honored to appear before you today to present the 
President’s fiscal year (FY) 2020 budget for the Department of Justice.  I am joined here by the 
Department’s Chief Financial Officer: Assistant Attorney General for Administration Lee 
Lofthus.  Let me start by thanking you for your strong support of the Department in the recently 
enacted FY 2019 Omnibus Appropriations Act. 
 
President Trump’s FY 2020 Budget proposal totals $29.2 billion for the Department of 
Justice to support federal law enforcement and the public safety priorities of our state, local, and 
tribal law enforcement partners.  The request reflects a commitment to the Department’s 
priorities of reducing violent crime, enforcing the nation’s immigration laws, combating the 
opioid epidemic, and addressing national security threats to this great nation. 
 
First, the Department of Justice is working hard every day to combat violent crime.  
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) statistics show that, in 2015 and 2016, the United States 
experienced the largest increases in violent crime in a quarter-century.1  The Administration has 
prioritized reversing that trend.  In 2017 and 2018, the Department revitalized federal efforts to 
fight violent crime, including the launch of the enhanced Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) 
initiative, which brings together all levels of law enforcement and the communities they serve to 
develop effective, locally based strategies to reduce violent crime.  In FY 2018, the Department 
prosecuted the greatest number of violent criminals in at least 25 years, thanks to the necessary 
resources provided by this Committee and Congress.  Since 2016, violent crime has decreased. 
Of course, the Department’s work is not done—crime is still far too high, especially in 
the most vulnerable neighborhoods.  We need to build on our efforts in 2019 and beyond.  To 
that end, the FY 2020 budget allocates an additional $137.9 million to reduce violent crime and 
combat transnational criminal organizations (TCOs).  These resources will enable the 
Department to dismantle the worst criminal organizations and target the most violent offenders. 
Second, the Department remains committed to enforcing and improving our immigration 
laws.  As I’ve stated before, in order to ensure that our immigration system works properly, we 
must secure our Nation’s borders, and we must ensure that our laws allow us to process, hold, 
and remove those who violate our immigration laws.  Through the FY 2020 President’s budget, 
the Department will continue improving its ability to enforce our immigration laws and combat 
illegal immigration by expanding court capacity for immigration hearings, improving efficiency 
in the immigration process, and removing impediments to the timely administration of justice.

Specifically, the budget requests an additional $72.1 million to enhance border security 
and immigration enforcement.  To maintain the efficacy and efficiency of immigration 
enforcement and adjudication programs, the Department requests $71.1 million for 100 new 
immigration judges and support staff for the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).  
This budget request supports the Department, along with our partners at the Department of 
Homeland Security, in our efforts to fix our immigration system. 
 
Third, the Department is fighting hard against the scourge of illegal drugs, and in 
particular the opioid crisis.  The United States is in the midst of the deadliest drug epidemic in 
American history.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more 
than 70,200 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017, a 10 percent increase from the 
previous year.2  The President declared a National Public Health Emergency in October 2017, 
and the Department remains committed to doing its part to protect the American people from the 
impact of drugs and drug-related crimes nationwide.  In 2018, the Department charged 7,000 
defendants with offenses involving fentanyl, heroin, or opioids; that is a Department record, and 
we are on track to break it this year.  But despite these record efforts, overdose deaths remain far 
too high. 
The Department must redouble its efforts to combat this crisis.  The budget includes 
$295 million to enable the Department to target the organizations responsible for the opioid 
epidemic and drug-related violence in our communities.  It also bolsters the capacity of 
Department agents to deny revenues to drug traffickers using the best cyber capabilities and 
technologies, enabling the Department to keep pace with these nefarious actors. 
Fourth, the Department is pursuing several programs—both old and new—to protect 
national security.  These include protecting American elections from foreign interference, 
combating and preventing cyber attacks, and fighting terrorism both at home and abroad.  The 
budget dedicates $132 million in program enhancements to address constantly evolving national 
security threats, including the areas of cyber, counterterrorism, and counterintelligence. 
Our DOJ team, along with our federal, state, local, and tribal partners, has been working 
diligently to address these issues each and every day.  The budget request supports many other 
key programs, for example, by prioritizing public safety at the state, local, and tribal levels 
through approximately $4.3 billion in discretionary and mandatory funding and by securing 
funds to help the victims of crime.  In line with the President’s priorities and Congress’s shared 
commitment to protecting the public fisc, our proposal also includes restructuring initiatives that 
are designed to reduce both bureaucracy and costs to the American taxpayer. 
Let me say clearly, Mr. Chairman, you and this Committee have been strongly 
supportive.  We are determined to use every dollar you have provided to us to achieve the 
maximum benefit in our efforts to fight crime and protect the American people.  I would now to 
like to tell you more about how our budget proposal furthers the priorities that I have just 
outlined.

Combating Violent Crime 
 
  Protecting the American people from violent crime is a top priority for the Department of 
Justice.  In 2015 and 2016, violent crime increased by nearly 7 percent.  Robberies, assaults, and 
rapes all increased, and murder increased by a shocking 20 percent.  
 
  As a result of the Department’s efforts, violent crime has decreased nationwide since 
2016.3  A key part of this success has been the revitalization of Project Safe Neighborhoods that 
I mentioned above.  We are requesting a total of $100 million for this important program.  Under 
this program, grants are awarded to local law enforcement agencies, outreach and prevention 
service providers, and researchers to support activities implementing local PSN anti-violence 
strategies across the country. 
 
The FY 2020 budget requests a total of $137.9 million in program enhancements to 
reduce violent crime and combat TCOs.  This includes funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) National Integrated Ballistic Information Network 
(NIBIN).  The funds will allow ATF to expand the National Correlation and Tracing Center 
(NNCTC) services to an additional five sites in FY 2020, support additional training, increase the 
capacity of ballistic imaging and correlation hardware and software, and provide necessary 
infrastructure for further expansion of services to NIBIN sites.  This will bring NIBIN to 
approximately 200 sites by the end of FY 2020.  The Department is also requesting $4.2 million 
to enable the FBI to increase their capacity to perform Criminal Background Check System 
(NICS) background checks for firearms purchases.   
 
To ensure this continued decrease in crime, the Department is requesting $5.8 million to 
enhance violent crime and firearms prosecutions by United States Attorneys’ Offices.  This 
request will give our United States Attorneys the support they need to prosecute complex 
criminal cases.  
 
The request also provides $18.2 million for the FBI to counter the ever-evolving threat 
posed by TCOs.  This enhancement will support the FBI’s Joint Criminal Opioid Darknet 
Enforcement (J-CODE) initiative to disrupt and dismantle the Darknet illicit marketplaces 
facilitating the distribution of fentanyl and other opioids.  This critical initiative brings together 
agents, analysts, federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement with expertise in drugs, gangs, 
and health care fraud from across the U.S. Government to target the trafficking of fentanyl and 
other opioids on the Darknet. 
 
Understanding the need to address violent crime at our borders with our state and local 
partners, the Department is requesting $6 million for a new grant program in the Office of Justice 
Programs (OJP):  the Southwest Border Rural Law Enforcement Violent Crime Reduction 
Initiative.  This program will empower rural law enforcement agencies by providing training, 
technical assistance, and resources to interdict drug and human traffickers who are exploiting the 
corridors into our country.

Enforcing Immigration Laws   
 
  Enforcement of the Nation’s immigration laws also remains a vital mission of the 
Department.  As I have said many times, the United States has some of the world’s most liberal 
and expansive immigration laws, and we aim to admit visitors and immigrants equitably from all 
around the globe.  But the integrity and fairness of our immigration system depends on robust 
enforcement against those who flout or circumvent our laws.  To safeguard our borders and 
ensure due process, the Department is requesting an additional $72.1 million for immigration 
enforcement. 
 
This request includes funding for 100 new immigration judges, which will bring EOIR’s 
authorized immigration judge level to 634 by the end of FY 2020 – a 31 percent increase since 
FY 2018.  The Department believes that these new immigration judges are necessary to provide 
some relief from a critical backlog in the immigration courts.  At the end of the first quarter of 
FY 2019, there were over 820,000 cases pending in immigration courts nationwide.  That 
caseload is by far the largest-ever pending caseload before the Department, marking the 12th 
consecutive year of increased backlogs.  The 100 new immigration judges will help us to reverse 
that trend—but it is important to note that the continued influx of cases originating from the 
border constrains our ability to manage the backlog of cases, and other reforms are necessary. 
 
The request also includes an increase of roughly $1 million for the Department’s 
Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) to support their Land Acquisition Section.  
The President has prioritized efforts to build and maintain physical barriers at the Southern 
Border.  The Land Acquisition Section is responsible for assisting DHS and other federal 
partners in acquiring real property for border security projects.  These funds will allow ENRD to 
commit 6 more attorneys to these efforts. 
 
Combating the Opioid Epidemic 
 
  Overdose deaths—and in particular, deaths from opioid overdoses—remain a public 
health crisis, and trafficking of illegal drugs is closely tied to the ongoing problems of violent 
crime and border security.  The Department of Justice has been working hard to fight drug 
trafficking and diversion, but much, much more remains to be done.  That is why the Department 
is requesting an additional $295 million to combat the opioid crisis and bolster drug enforcement 
efforts. 
   
  The Department’s approach to combating the opioid epidemic includes a request for 
$11.1 million to fund five new heroin enforcement groups that will be deployed to Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) Field Divisions that have identified heroin as the first- or 
second-greatest threat to their area.  These resources will also allow for more agents at DEA 
Field Divisions to target the Mexican TCOs that pose the greatest drug threat to the United 
States.  An additional $1.65 million will go to support DEA’s flagship Sensitive Investigative 
Unit (SIU) Program to combat highly sophisticated TCOs known for supplying illicit substances 
to distributors and users in the United States.  The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task 
Forces (OCDETF) Program has requested $2 million in operational funds to support the ongoing 
and rapidly expanding National Opioid Initiative.  This will support the hundreds of federal 
agents and prosecutors who are handling the expansion of opioid investigations. 
5 
 
 
 
  Further, DEA manages or participates in Translation and Transcription Support Services, 
known as Judicial Wire Intercept Programs (JWIP), in approximately 20 countries.  An 
additional $10 million in funding will go to support the consolidation of nine core legacy judicial 
wire intercept systems into one new judicial wire intercept platform in Colombia.  In addition, 
DEA requests $11.7 million to invest in its cyber investigation capabilities.  With these funds, 
DEA intends to place technical specialists in each of DEA’s 23 field offices to assist agents in 
cyber-specific cases.  
 
  Finally, the President’s Budget proposes to permanently transfer management of the $254 
million High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program from the Office of National 
Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to DEA to facilitate stronger coordination with other drug 
enforcement assets.  Transferring the HIDTA grants to DEA will enable the agency to focus on 
combating drug trafficking in areas where the threat is the greatest and where there is a 
coordinated law enforcement presence. 
 
National Security 
 
  National Security remains among the Department’s top priorities.  Threats are constantly 
evolving, requiring additional investments to mitigate these threats.  Therefore, the Department’s 
FY 2020 budget includes a request of $132 million in program enhancements focused on cyber, 
counterterrorism, and counterintelligence.  It also reflects an increased role for the U.S. Marshals 
Service (USMS) in dignitary protection to promote government-wide efficiency.   
 
Election security is a key issue for the Department.  Working together with our partners 
in the federal government, I will build on the work already done by the Department in this area 
and ensure that the full might of our resources are brought to bear against foreign persons who 
unlawfully interfere in our elections.  I believe that our country must respond to any foreign 
interference with the strongest measures, and we must work with partners at the state level to 
ensure that our election infrastructure is completely protected. 
 
Similarly, we must protect Americans against cyber attacks, whether foreign or domestic.  
The Department requests an additional $70.5 million to enhance the FBI’s cyber information-
sharing abilities and cyber tools and capabilities.  The FBI’s multi-pronged cyber enterprise 
strategy uses predictive means and investigative partnerships to impose consequences against 
cyber adversaries who target U.S. interests.  Additionally, to protect high-value assets and 
information in the Department’s data centers, DOJ must improve security monitoring at all 
levels.  As such, the Department requests $2 million to extend its detection and response 
capabilities beyond the on-premises network to the places where our data resides. 
 
  In our efforts to combat terrorism, the Department is requesting $16.6 million for the 
National Vetting Center (NVC).  This request will provide for the vetting of people seeking to 
enter or remain within the United States.  The NVC will increase the government’s ability to 
identify terrorists, criminals, and other nefarious actors.  These resources will help enable the 
NVC to provide timely information regarding the risk an individual poses.  Furthermore, the 
Department requests $17.1 million to enhance the FBI's capability to respond to threats posed by 
6 
 
 
chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear devices found within the United States and its 
territories. 
 
  In addition, the Department is requesting $18.3 million for the FBI to address 
counterintelligence threats, particularly those from hostile foreign intelligence agencies and other 
non-state and criminal adversaries employing advanced cyber-based attacks.  These resources 
will allow the Department to combat these growing and serious threats by bolstering cyber 
investigative and collaborative capabilities and capacities.  The request will also assist the FBI in 
providing support to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which 
reviews foreign acquisitions of domestic entities that might affect national security.  
Additionally, the Department is requesting $5 million to support efforts of the National Security 
Division (NSD) to prevent foreign intelligence services from accessing sensitive information and 
technology.  The request will support NSD’s review, mitigation, and monitoring of foreign 
investments in the United States for national security risks including filings on behalf of CFIUS.  
The Department also requests $1.4 million to support NSD’s growing mission of protecting 
national assets against cyber threats, including thwarting efforts by terrorists and nation states to 
infiltrate our critical infrastructure and combating economic espionage. 
 
  In an effort to improve services and to save taxpayer money in the long run, the 
Department is requesting $1 million for the Protective Detail Consolidation evaluation.  The 
USMS will evaluate protection requirements for civilian Cabinet and sub-Cabinet level officials 
in support of the President’s 2018 Government Reform and Reorganization Plan.  The USMS 
will coordinate with Executive Branch agencies to assess existing agency protective plans, 
develop standards and best practices for protective detail staffing and evaluation, and prepare a 
range of policy options to promote standardization and effective monitoring, assessment, and 
response to potential threats.  
 
State, Local, and Tribal Assistance  
 
  The Department supports its partners in state, local, and tribal law enforcement, whose 
actions are crucial in the fight against violent crime and the opioid epidemic.  The FY 2020 
budget continues that commitment to state, local, and tribal public safety officials by investing 
approximately $4.3 billion in discretionary and mandatory funding in programs to assist them.  
This includes $405.2 million in total funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance 
Grant Program (Byrne JAG).  This funding is the primary source of flexible funding for state, 
local, and tribal jurisdictions across all components of the criminal justice system.  Byrne JAG 
funding is used to address critical gaps in their criminal justice systems in order to increase 
public safety and prevent crime.  In 2020, Byrne JAG will also fund other important officer 
safety programs serving state, local, and tribal law enforcement, including $22.5 million for the 
Bulletproof Vest Program, $22.5 million for the Body Worn Cameras Program, $3.6 million for 
the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), and $15 million for the Valor 
Initiative.  Two additional set-asides include $5 million for the Public Safety Partnership (PSP) 
Program, which leverages DOJ resources to reduce violence in cities with the highest violent 
crime rates, and $6 million for the Southwest Border Law Enforcement Violent Crime Initiative, 
which I discussed previously.  Finally, our budget request includes $330 million for programs 
authorized by the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016. 
 
7 
 
 
  In December, Congress passed and the President signed the First Step Act of 2018, which 
seeks to reduce recidivism, refine sentencing laws, and eliminate disproportionate penalties for 
certain crimes.  I intend to robustly fund and diligently implement this bill at the Department.  
The Act directs the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) to evaluate Second Chance Act programs 
no later than five years after its enactment.  Therefore, the FY 2020 Budget requests $1.5 million 
for NIJ to support the first phase of this evaluation, which will focus on identifying appropriate 
outcome measures for Second Chance Act programs.  In addition, related to the First Step Act, 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is requesting $14 million to incentivize the development of 
innovative pilot projects in reentry and recidivism-reduction approaches.  BOP is also requesting 
$1 million to expand the availability of medication-assisted treatment for inmates with opioid 
abuse disorders and to enable more inmates to get treatment. 
   
  We can never forget that crime statistics represent crime victims whose lives have been 
changed by criminal acts.  In recognition of National Crime Victims’ Rights Week, the 
Department renews its commitment to strive for justice and to connect these survivors with vital 
services as they heal.  The President’s budget includes $2.3 billion from the Crime Victims Fund 
to assist victims and survivors of crime, to build capacity to enhance response to crime victims’ 
needs, and to increase offender accountability.  Of this total, $115 million will be devoted to 
improving services and justice for tribal victims of crime, as the violent crime rate in Indian 
Country remains extraordinarily high. 
 
  In addition, the budget includes $77 million in discretionary funding for grants to support 
human trafficking victims and those providing direct services for survivors and improving the 
community response to victims through outreach, training, and technical assistance. 
 
Restructuring Initiatives 
  The Administration is committed to establishing a leaner, more productive federal 
government that reduces both bureaucracy and costs to the American taxpayer.  Since 2017, the 
Department of Justice has undertaken efforts to refocus resources and return our efforts to our 
core mission.  To support the President’s Executive Order on Reorganizing the Executive 
Branch, the Department of Justice has begun taking steps to streamline and improve its good 
stewardship of taxpayers’ dollars.  As part of the FY 2020 President’s Budget, the Department is 
proposing a number of initiatives to achieve savings, reduce the size of government, and 
maximize agency performance.  Highlights of the restructuring initiatives include:  
 
•  The FY 2020 budget proposes legislation that will move the responsibilities related to 
alcohol and tobacco enforcement from ATF to the Department of Treasury’s Alcohol and 
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.  ATF will retain its current enforcement responsibilities 
for firearms and explosives.  The transfer of the alcohol and tobacco authorities will 
allow ATF to devote additional resources to its primary mission of combating violent 
crime through initiatives such as its highly effective NIBIN and Crime Gun Intelligence 
Centers.   
 
•  The Department proposes to improve our service to our state, local, and tribal partners 
and our grant programs in a variety of ways.  The Department is developing one grants-
management system to streamline and improve the grants process.  The request also 
8 
 
 
consolidates the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) within OJP.  
The budget also proposes to transfer activities of the National Institute of Corrections 
from the BOP to OJP.  This will help to consolidate the Department’s state and local 
corrections research and evaluation programs and better align efforts to assist state, local, 
and tribal corrections professionals with OJP grant programs.  
 
•  The budget also proposes to transfer the functions of the Community Relations Service to 
the Civil Rights Division, allowing to the Department to perform its community 
mediation work in a more centralized manner and at a greater savings to the taxpayer.    
 
•  As previously noted, the budget proposes to transfer the HIDTA grant program from 
ONDCP to DEA.  This change will eliminate redundancies within federal organizations 
by moving this program, which supports states and communities fighting the scourge of 
illegal drugs, into the same agency leading the enforcement efforts in those communities. 
 
Chairman Moran and Ranking Member Shaheen, it is my pleasure to highlight our efforts 
to be good stewards of the resources and authorities bestowed on us as we strengthen the 
Department’s ability to ensure safety, equality, and justice for all Americans.  As Attorney 
General, I am committed to making the Department of Justice run as efficiently and effectively 
as possible, without adding to the burden on the American taxpayer.  I thank you for your past 
support of the Department’s financial needs, and for the opportunity to present our FY 2020 
budget request.  I look forward to working with you through the upcoming fiscal year to ensure 
that the Department of Justice remains on solid financial footing and can accomplish its multiple 
and varied missions effectively.  I look forward to your questions.  Thank you.

CHIEF, NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU 
 
BEFORE THE 
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON DEFENSE 
 
FIRST SESSION, 116TH CONGRESS 
ON  
THE NATIONAL GUARD  
AND RESERVE POSTURE HEARING 
APRIL 10th, 2019 
 
 
NOT FOR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION  
UNTIL RELEASED BY  
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE 
 
1 
 
INTRODUCTION  
Chairman Shelby, Vice Chairman Durbin, and distinguished members of the 
subcommittee, it is a pleasure to be here today with my fellow Reserve Component 
Leaders.   
I assumed duties as the Chief of the National Guard Bureau over two years 
ago. It has been my honor each and every day to represent nearly 450,000 Soldiers 
and Airmen serving in the National Guard.  They are the finest National Guard 
force in our nation’s history.         
For 18 years, the joint force focused on executing counterinsurgency 
operations and fighting violent extremists. Counterinsurgency operations will 
remain a core competency. However, the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) 
refocuses the Department of Defense (DoD) for long-term competition with China 
and Russia.  The NDS portrays China and Russia as our dominant focus, while 
Iran, North Korea, and non-state actors remain national security threats.        
Your National Guard’s three core missions of fighting America’s wars, 
protecting the homeland, and building enduring partnerships directly support the 
NDS’s three lines of effort: building a more lethal force; strengthening alliances and 
attracting new partners; and reforming the DoD for greater performance and 
affordability.   
 
2 
 
The National Guard has transformed itself since the first Gulf War.  It is now 
an operational force and no longer a strategic reserve.  It is imperative the National 
Guard remains an operational force, as part of our Army and Air Force, that helps 
protect and secure our interests at home and abroad.  
        
BUILDING A MORE LETHAL FORCE FOR THE WARFIGHT AND HOMELAND: 
Warfight: 
First, fighting America’s wars is the primary mission of the National Guard. 
The National Guard is focused on readiness as the NDS demands more lethality 
from our military. We are the principal combat reserve of the Army and Air Force 
making up 20 percent of the entire joint force providing strategic depth in support 
of combatant commands. There is only one standard of readiness in fighting 
America’s wars.  This readiness requires the National Guard to be deployable, 
sustainable, and interoperable with our active components.  Enhancing full-time 
support and replacing and upgrading dilapidated facilities are vital in that regard.  
The National Guard also requires parity in equipping its force through concurrent 
and balanced modernization and recapitalization so that it can deliver the lethality 
required to the joint force.   
On any given day, the National Guard averages 30,000 Soldiers and Airmen 
mobilized on duty in every region of the world.  When mobilized and deployed, the 
Guard is interchangeable with its active components.  We provide the joint force 
highly trained and experienced Soldiers and Airmen to meet mission requirements 
3 
 
anywhere.  Our Citizen Soldiers and Airmen are present wherever you see the 
Army and the Air Force.    
“Thirty-nine days a year” is no longer the standard for much of the National 
Guard. Today’s force expects to be deployed. Predictable and rotational 
mobilizations, where our service members can utilize their training, will help keep 
the force relevant, ready, and integrated with our active components.   
The President directed the stand up of a Space Force this past year to 
protect and develop our vital interests in space. DoD space-based assets and 
capabilities protect our critical infrastructure, our economy, and our democracy. 
The National Guard continues to contribute critical capabilities in space, and we 
stand ready to support any future Space Force.   
Homeland: 
The NDS underscores the fact our homeland is no longer a sanctuary and 
new technologies and weapons can reach the heart of America with little or no 
warning. The 2019 Missile Defense Review clearly articulates the need to pursue 
advanced missile defense concepts and technologies to protect the homeland. The 
National Guard, with its Missile Defenders at Fort Greely, Alaska, Schriever Air 
Force Base, Colorado, and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, remains critical 
to our nation’s missile defense and stands ready to evolve in recognition of 
advancing threats.      
The National Guard’s unique dual State and Federal roles and robust 
presence in 2,600 communities in our states, territories, and the District of 
4 
 
Columbia give our forces the widest presence of any military force in America and 
the ability to quickly respond to contingencies. Our skills and experience from the 
warfight are used to assist first responders and play an important part in a unified 
response under Federal or State command during domestic emergencies.  We will 
remain, in most cases, the first military force to assist first responders in the 
States, territories, and the District of Columbia. 
In addition to approximately 30,000 Soldiers and Airmen mobilized around 
the world, on average, we have approximately 10,000 Guard Soldiers and Airmen 
conducting operations in the United States on a typical day. We provide capability 
and capacity to United States Northern Command and North American Aerospace 
Defense Command.  Fifteen of the sixteen alert sites safeguarding our skies within 
the United States are operated by the Air National Guard (ANG). The National 
Guard Counterdrug Program assists law enforcement with the detection, 
interdiction, disruption and curtailment of illicit drug trafficking. Approximately 55 
percent of DoD’s chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) response 
enterprise, capable of responding to a host of CBRN threats, reside in the National 
Guard. National Guard cyber units protect DoD’s critical networks from malicious 
cyberattacks and provide an important cyber resource to Governors. Our Ground-
based Midcourse Defense units in Alaska, Colorado, and California protect our 
nation from ballistic missiles.  
Last year, the National Guard supported responses to natural disasters such 
as Hurricanes Florence and Michael, and the wildland fires in California by 
5 
 
providing a myriad of services and aid to those devastated in these regions. The 
National Guard was there every step of the way.  
Whether executing DoD support to the Department of Homeland Security’s 
Southwest border security mission or providing support for State responses to 
catastrophic disasters, the National Guard meets its homeland requirements while 
also meeting its wartime missions in support of combatant commands. 
       
STRENGTHEN ALLIANCES AND ATTRACT NEW PARTNERS: 
Alliances and partnerships provide an enduring, asymmetric strategic 
advantage over our competitors.  Working with allies maintains the favorable 
balance of power that deters aggression and promotes stability and economic 
growth. 
The DoD uses multiple tools to strengthen partnerships and alliances that 
include security assistance, security cooperation, military-to-military leader and 
staff engagement, and regional cooperation. The National Guard aligns with the 
joint force through these activities and adds a unique contribution through the 
State Partnership Program (SPP). 
Partnerships: 
Eighty-three countries currently participate in the SPP with more 
partnerships expected in 2019. The SPP is a high leverage, low-cost program with 
partnerships in every region of the world. It expands America’s competitive space 
6 
 
through exchanges that extend beyond the military realm. Roughly one-third of the 
nations in the world are partnered with one of our 50 states, our territories, and 
the District of Columbia. These relationships, built on trust, the exchange of ideas, 
and mutual respect, served as the basis for approximately 80 co-deployments and 
turned many security consumers into security providers. 
The SPP is a scalable and tailored approach to security cooperation. The 
National Guard consults and coordinates with combatant commanders, U.S. 
Embassies and their Country Teams, and host nations to understand the full 
range of issues they face.  SPP events are led by respective state adjutants general 
who seek engagements on a broad array of interests that are beneficial to both 
nations. Over 950 SPP events were conducted in FY18 across all Geographic 
Combatant Commands. In some of these regions, the SPP is the primary tool 
utilized by host nations for security cooperation.  Given the benefits of this 
program, consistent funding is critical to sustain the groundwork and momentum 
that have been built over the 25 years since it began. 
The National Guard’s emphasis on partnerships did not begin with the SPP. 
Our history as a state-controlled organization naturally led to partnerships with 
state and local agencies and their officials. Governors leverage our presence 
throughout the nation through multiagency integrated playbooks used for 
planning and responding to crises.  They call the National Guard to augment their 
state and local emergency response to leverage military capabilities and skills 
gained from the warfight such as manpower, training, leadership, organization, 
logistics, and communications.  We instinctively take a collaborative and 
7 
 
multiagency approach to all emergencies based on our years of working with 
Governors and local community partners.  We remain the States’ sole military force 
to respond to domestic incidents.    
The National Guard is a community-based force where our members are an 
integral part of their local communities.  Whether partnering with local chapters of 
Youth ChalleNGe where more than 170,000 at-risk teenagers have graduated since 
its inception in 1993, or assisting local responders after a heavy snowstorm, the 
National Guard reinforces the connection between the American people and their 
military.   
 
REFORM THE DOD FOR GREATER PERFORMANCE AND AFFORDABILITY: 
Business reform is mandated by the NDS. The National Guard helps DoD 
achieve greater performance and affordability by optimizing the inherent cost-
savings of the National Guard and posturing our forces for predictable operational 
requirements. This directly supports the joint force in meeting global demands and 
preserves readiness in the active components. 
Reforming for greater performance also includes properly organizing the 
National Guard to achieve mission objectives. The National Guard Bureau (NGB) is 
a DoD joint activity with statutes and policies codifying the roles and functions of 
our organization. Along with the Office of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, 
the NGB is comprised of the Army National Guard Directorate, the Air National 
Guard Directorate, and the NGB Joint Staff. The NGB operates as one entity 
8 
 
supporting the 50 states, three territories and the District of Columbia to man, 
train, and equip National Guard forces to execute DoD missions worldwide. We 
strive to ensure unity of effort within our organization and efficiently use the 
resources entrusted to the National Guard.  The NGB must continue its march 
towards reform and efficiencies. 
 
CNGB’S THREE PRIORITIES: 
I have laid out three priorities to accomplish the objectives of the NDS and 
our three core missions of warfight, homeland, and partnerships - provide ready 
forces to the President and our Governors, take care of and develop our people, 
and promote an innovative culture.     
Priority #1 Readiness: 
The National Guard contributes to readiness recovery for the joint force by 
providing additional capacity through rotational forces. By deploying for known 
requirements, the National Guard enables the joint force to meet increasing global 
demands while reducing strain on the active components. In FY18, our Soldiers 
and Airmen supported DoD missions spanning every Geographic Combatant 
Command and utilized some of the same skills helping communities throughout 
the nation in responding to emergencies such as hurricanes, floods, winter storms, 
a volcano, and wildfires.  
The Army National Guard (ARNG) is committed to providing ready forces that 
are warfighting-capable and Governor-responsive. In providing ready forces for the 
9 
 
Army and the joint force, the Army designates select ARNG formations as Focused 
Readiness Units that are available to rapidly deploy and conduct contingency 
operations. Additionally, four ARNG brigade combat teams and the units that 
support them will complete decisive-action training rotations at the Army’s premier 
combat training centers. These activities occur in parallel with deployments and 
exercises that our Citizen-Soldiers participate in around the world. The ARNG’s 
primary focus in FY20 is to reverse shortfalls in recruiting and ensure full-time 
support is fully leveraged to achieve and maintain our readiness.    
The ANG is also committed to the readiness of the force, its 21st century 
Guard Airmen, and building for tomorrow’s fight. The Air Guard provides the same 
levels of readiness and deployment timelines as the active duty. It exceeded its 
FY18 end strength goal of 106,600 with a continued focus on training and 
resourcing efforts that improve readiness and lethality.   
Looking to the future, the ANG must modernize and recapitalize its 
equipment concurrently and in a balanced manner commensurate with the active 
duty ensuring deployability, sustainability, and interoperability across all mission 
sets. The Air Guard remains focused on resourcing and training lethal, resilient 
Guard Airmen and developing exceptional leaders.   
Priority #2 People, Families, and Employers: 
There must be a balance between the needs of Guard members’ employers 
and the needs of the states and the nation. Striking the appropriate balance 
10 
 
requires training that is predictable, when possible, and deployments that leverage 
this training and enhance national security.   
We have increased our recruiting efforts. The current economic environment 
requires competing against other market forces and remaining competitive through 
incentives in order to recruit the very best men and women.   
The National Guard fosters integrity, respect, and candor within its ranks by 
maintaining high standards of personal conduct and bearing. We will not tolerate 
those who choose to act with a lack of integrity and character, nor will we accept 
sexual assault, sexual harassment, discrimination, and any forms of 
communication that degrade or demoralize unit cohesion and readiness. We 
provide our utmost support and care to victims of these acts.     
We are also emphasizing mental health and resiliency for our units as we 
strive to prevent suicides. Any Soldier or Airman who takes his or her own life is 
one too many.  First-line supervisors, battle buddies and wingmen will continue to 
receive the requisite training necessary to look out for fellow Soldiers and Airmen.   
We must also ensure our families are aware of family readiness programs, 
employment assistance programs, and where to turn when they need help.  Our 
families faithfully commit to our nation and we must ensure we remain faithful to 
them.     
 
 
11 
 
Priority #3 Innovation: 
The National Guard is a catalyst for DoD’s innovation initiatives.  Whether 
looking at ways to save costs through greater utilization of untapped capacity in 
the National Guard, or reviewing ways to expand the competitive space and 
increase our advantages through our SPP, DoD has many options to use the Guard 
as “the innovative force” to help address today’s challenges.     
We have dedicated resources to ensure our culture is dynamic, and forward 
leaning by questioning existing processes and challenging the status quo. We have 
to educate and empower our Guardsmen and implement innovative measures. 
Our National Guard Innovation Team (NGIT) is one vehicle we use to 
innovate. This team leverages the talent, experience, abilities, and insight of our 
traditional Guardsmen enabling the Guard to integrate skill sets and join Guard 
members from unconnected fields that can sometimes lead to breakthroughs. This 
past year, the NGIT worked on issues related to communications, employer 
support, recruiting and retention, reform initiatives, and technology adaptation. 
The challenge ahead will be in the implementation of some very innovative ideas.    
 
CONCLUSION: 
The operational National Guard is an integral part of the joint force and 
plays an important role in every aspect of our national security and defense. I am 
proud of the Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen who serve to protect our homeland and 
interests abroad. We face many challenges ahead, some in areas not seen before. 
12 
 
However, I am confident we will confront these challenges as we always have – 
through the extraordinary talents and commitment of our Guardsmen and women. 
We remain…Always Ready, Always There!

SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 
WRITTEN STATEMENT TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND 
RELATED PROGRAMS 
ON THE FY 2020 BUDGET 
APRIL 9, 2019 
 
Chairman Graham, Vice Chairman Leahy, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee: 
 
I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the Administration’s FY 2020 budget request for the State 
Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. 
 
To support our National Security Strategy and achieve our foreign policy goals, the President has 
submitted an FY 2020 budget request of $40 billion for the State Department and USAID.   
 
The proposed request will allow us to protect our citizens at home and abroad, advance 
American prosperity and values, and support our allies and partners overseas.  
 
It will promote partner countries’ economic and security self-reliance as they begin to transition 
away from U.S. assistance programs, which the American people have generously underwritten 
for decades.  
 
We make this request mindful of the burden on American taxpayers, and our obligation to 
deliver exceptional results on their behalf. 
 
*** 
1 
 
 
In an era of great power competition, the State Department and USAID’s work is key to our 
security, the protection of our freedoms, and the promotion of American values.  
 
China is proactively applying its power and exerting its influence in the Indo-Pacific region and 
beyond.  Under President Trump’s leadership, the United States is responding decisively to 
China’s aggressive actions.  The United States’ future security, prosperity, and leadership 
depends on maintaining a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific.  To advance the Indo-Pacific 
strategy, the budget request nearly doubles U.S. foreign assistance resources targeting this 
crucial area compared to the FY 2019 request.  
 
Russia poses threats that have evolved beyond external or military aggression, and now include 
influence operations targeting America and the Western world.  This budget prioritizes 
countering Russian malign influence in Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia, and further 
strengthens the Department’s own systems against malign actors. 
 
Our diplomatic efforts toward the final, fully-verified denuclearization of North Korea are the 
most successful that have ever been undertaken.  We remain committed to that goal.  This budget 
provides for our diplomatic outreach to continue, and to continue implementation and 
enforcement of sanctions until we achieve our objective.  
 
We know that the Islamic Republic of Iran’s authoritarian regime will continue to use their 
nation’s resources to proliferate conflict in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, and beyond.  It will continue to 
bankroll terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.  
2 
 
 
 
The United States will therefore work together with our allies and partners to counter Tehran’s 
aggressive actions to undermine peace and security in the Middle East and beyond.   
 
As the people of Venezuela continue to fight for their freedom, the budget request includes 
funding to support democracy and prosperity in Venezuela.  The budget also requests new 
authority to support a democratic transition in Venezuela, including transferring up to $500 
million to foreign assistance accounts.   
 
The budget also delivers on the President’s commitment to optimize the effectiveness of our 
outdated and fragmented overseas humanitarian assistance.  It ensures the United States will 
remain the world's largest single donor of humanitarian assistance.  The proposal maximizes the 
impact of taxpayer dollars, helps more beneficiaries, and delivers the greatest outcomes by 
consolidating our humanitarian programming in a new bureau at USAID.  This budget request 
also preserves the State Department’s lead role on protection issues, as well as the U.S. refugee 
admissions program.  Further, through available funding in 2019 and 2020, the United States will 
have on average approximately $9 billion available per year to support overseas humanitarian 
programs, maintaining the highest level of U.S. overseas humanitarian funding ever. 
  
President Trump has made the protection of religious freedom a key priority at home and abroad. 
The Fiscal Year 2020 budget supports our efforts to continue U.S. leadership in the promotion of 
global religious freedom and the protection of persecuted religious and ethnic minorities all 
around the world. This July, the State Department will host the second annual Ministerial to 
3 
 
 
Advance Religious Freedom.  
 
American assistance is helping to reverse the devastation and suffering caused by ISIS and 
associated terrorist groups.  But much work remains to be done.  Working by, with, and through 
local partners and community leaders, our assistance programs clear explosive remnants of war 
to help keep families safe, restore access to critical health and education services, improve 
economic opportunities, and more.   
 
As we work to promote economic growth, the Fiscal Year 2020 Budget includes a request for 
$100 million for a new Fund at USAID for the White House-led Women’s Global Development 
and Prosperity Initiative.  Through the Fund, we will work to find and scale proposals that 
advance women’s economic empowerment across the developing world, in support of the 
Initiative’s goal of reaching 50 million women by 2025. 
 
There are few efforts as important to this Administration and to the safety and security of the 
American people as border security.  The State Department and USAID budget request will 
strengthen visa vetting, and improve our targeting of illicit pathways that transnational criminal 
organizations use to traffic people, drugs, money, and weapons into our nation.   
 
President Trump has made it clear that U.S. foreign assistance should serve America’s interests, 
and should support countries that help us to advance our foreign policy goals.  This budget 
therefore maintains critical support for key U.S. allies, including Israel, Jordan, Egypt, and 
Colombia, among others.  
4 
 
 
 
The FY 2020 Request also includes $175 million for a Diplomatic Progress Fund.  These funds 
will be used to respond to new opportunities arising from potential progress in diplomatic and 
peace efforts around the world. 
 
Finally, the diplomatic challenges we face today are compounded by rapid advancements in 
technology and an ever-changing media environment.  We need our colleagues to be safe, 
prepared, and ready to take on any challenge at a moment’s notice.  The FY 2020 budget will 
fully fund State and USAID's current workforce levels, enabling us to take on emerging policy 
challenges.  We are also modernizing our human resources, IT infrastructure, and organizational 
structures to stay on the cutting edge of 21st century innovation. 
 
We must continue to put American interests first and remain a beacon of freedom to the world. 
With the support of Congress, and through the strategic, efficient use of resources, this budget 
will do just that.  
 
Thank you.

 HOLD UNTIL RELEASED  
BY THE COMMITTEE  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statement of 
Honorable Robert McMahon 
Assistant Secretary Of Defense 
(Sustainment) 
 
 
 
Before the Senate Committee on Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  
Fiscal Year 2020 Department of Defense Budget Request for  
Sustainment 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
April 09, 2019 
Introduction 
 
Chairman Boozman, Ranking Member Schatz and distinguished members of the Subcommittee: 
Thank you for the opportunity to present the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 budget request 
for the Department of Defense programs supporting Sustainment. 
  
The New Sustainment Organization 
 
With my confirmation as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment, we have 
consolidated the former Logistics and Materiel Readiness and the Energy, Installations & 
Environment portfolios into a more holistic organization focused on sustaining warfighter 
support.  As the principal sustainment official within the senior management tier of DoD, my 
mission is to advise and assist the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, 
the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Defense in providing guidance to the 
Secretaries of the Military Departments with respect to sustainment support.  I prescribe policies 
and procedures for facilities management, energy, environment, infrastructure, logistics, materiel 
readiness, and product support.  In addition, I exercise authority, direction and control over the 
Office of Economic Adjustment and Director of the Defense Logistics Agency. 
 
Sustainment is big business.  We support warfighter capabilities through over 585,000 facilities, 
located on more than 500 bases, posts, camps, stations, yards, and centers around the world, with 
a facility replacement cost exceeding $1 trillion, not including the value of the 27 million acres 
of land that our installations occupy.  Additionally, defense logistics alone represents a quarter of 
the Department’s budget, while sustaining nearly $1 trillion in materiel assets, including 275 
ships, 14,000 aircraft, and almost 500,000 combat and other ground vehicles.  We manage 
approximately, 5,000,000 stock numbers, 100,000 suppliers, 90,000 requisitions per day and an 
inventory valued at nearly $100 billion.   The Defense Logistics Agency has annual sales of $38 
billion. 
 
As the head of this enterprise, my strategic objectives are to a) enhance materiel availability of 
DoD weapon systems; b) create and sustain resilient installations; and c) ensure safe places for 
our members and their families to live, work, play, and pray.   
 
The FY 2020 budget request supports the National Defense Strategy’s (NDS) three lines of 
effort: rebuilding readiness and lethality; strengthening alliances and partnerships; and improving 
performance and affordability through reform.  Investments in infrastructure, environment, 
energy, logistics, materiel readiness, and weapons support are crucial for NDS implementation.  
Every mission the DoD Components undertake to defend this nation is supported by DoD 
installations, which are our power projection platforms.   
 
 
Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Request – Military Construction and Family Housing 
 
The President’s FY 2020 budget requests over $21 billion for the Military Construction 
(MilCon) and Family Housing appropriation, which includes $9.9 billion for the base budget 
MilCon requirements, $1.3 billion for family housing, $0.6 billion for Overseas Contingency 
1 
 
Operations, and $9.2 billion for responding to emergencies.  This represents a $9.8 billion 
increase from the FY 2019 enacted level primarily due to the aforementioned emergency 
funding, which will be used to restore funding which may be reallocated in FY 2019 to build 
border barriers should the Acting Secretary of Defense choose to exercise the 10 U.S.C. 2808 
authority. This funding will also be used to rebuild facilities damaged by Hurricanes Florence 
and Michael, and for unspecified military construction to build border barriers.  
 
This budget request continues the Department’s priorities to establish a foundation for rebuilding 
the U.S. military into a more capable, lethal, and ready Joint Force.  This funding will be used to 
construct or acquire facilities needed to bed-down new mission capabilities, restore and 
modernize enduring infrastructure, eliminate those that are excess or obsolete, and begin 
implementing projects supporting hurricane recovery. 
 
Military Construction 
 
We are requesting $9.9 billion in the base budget for military construction across the Services 
and Defense Agencies – an increase of approximately $1.1 billion from the FY 2019 enacted 
base budget. This increase is largely due to a need to fund the balance of projects that Congress 
incrementally funded in FY 2019; to support new capability/mission (e.g., F-35A and KC-46) 
bed down requirements, force structure growth, operations and training, maintenance and 
production, unaccompanied personnel housing, and replacing antiquated infrastructure at 
enduring installations in the United States and overseas.   
 
This request includes $2.6 billion for the Defense-Wide Components including $267 million for 
fuel infrastructure; $697 million for recapitalization of National Security Agency and National 
Geospatial Intelligence Agency facilities; $494 million to address new capabilities/mission, force 
structure growth, and infrastructure for Special Operations Forces; and for specific programs 
such as the NATO Security Investment Program and the Energy Resilience and Conservation 
Investment Program.   
 
In addition, the Defense-Wide request also contains $256 million for medical facility 
recapitalization including the third increment of $97 million of a $510 million project for the 
Walter Reed Medical Center Addition/Alteration; $50.0 million for the second increment (of a 
$381 million, five increment project) for a new hospital at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri; and 
other smaller ambulatory care center/dental and support facilities.  All the projects are crucial for 
our continued delivery of the quality health care that our service members and their families 
deserve.   
 
Overseas Contingency Operations 
 
The FY 2020 OCO budget request includes $645 million in MilCon, a decrease of $277 million 
from the FY 2019 enacted amount, to support critical global defense posture requirements 
focused primarily in European areas, including the ongoing European Deterrence Initiative 
(EDI).  EDI enhances readiness in Europe to deter Russian aggression and provides our allies a 
clear indication of the United States' long-term commitment to Europe.  This MilCon funding 
includes unspecified minor military construction and planning and design funds for airfield, 
2 
 
facility, and force protection upgrades.  The improvements continue our efforts to strengthen 
combat readiness and theater Joint Reception, Staging, Onward Movement, and Integration 
capabilities in the region.    
 
DoD Emergency Funding 
 
As noted earlier, the FY 2020 budget request includes $9.2 billion of emergency funding to 
restore resources that may be reallocated in FY 2019 to build border barriers should the Acting 
Secretary of Defense choose to exercise the 10 U.S.C. 2808 authority, to rebuild facilities 
damaged by Hurricanes Florence and Michael, and for unspecified military construction to build 
border barriers. 
 
Family and Unaccompanied Housing  
 
In return for the sacrifices they make in service to our nation, Service members and their families 
expect a safe and secure place to live, good schools for their children, access to good medical 
care, and a viable relocation process that respects their household goods.  The Department is 
committed to protecting the quality of life for military personnel and their families by ensuring 
access to safe, high-quality, affordable Family and Unaccompanied Housing where they will 
want to live.  The environment in which our Service members and their families live impacts 
their quality of life, their ability to do their job, and the Department's ability to recruit and retain.  
Ensuring a positive housing experience and quality of life is critical to support personnel 
readiness for new and current missions and strategic initiatives worldwide.  
 
Our FY 2020 budget request includes $1.3 billion to support our worldwide family housing 
inventory, which includes more than 34,000 government-owned and 7,100 leased family housing 
units. This request contains $293 million for construction of new housing and about $1 billion 
for operation and maintenance of DoD’s government-owned and leased family housing units, 
oversight of privatized housing on our U.S. installations, and provisioning of housing support 
services to assist military members with housing issues such as resolving landlord issues or 
providing information on the local housing market.  The requested funding demonstrates our 
commitment to provide safe, quality, affordable housing and housing support services to U.S. 
military personnel and their families. 
  
The Department’s FY 2020 budget request also demonstrates our continued commitment to 
modernizing Unaccompanied Personnel Housing, with more than $674 million requested for 
nine construction and renovation projects that will improve living conditions for more than 3,900 
trainees and permanent party unaccompanied personnel.  This includes $73 million for the 
second phase of a training barracks at Fort Sill, OK; $164 million for a bachelors enlisted 
quarters complex at Navy Base Guam; $110 million for a recruit barracks at Joint Base San 
Antonio, TX; and $134 million for a bachelor enlisted quarters project at Marine Corps Base 
Hawaii.  Our modernization effort includes a focus on improving privacy and access to amenities 
that are important to our unaccompanied personnel.  
 
Now that the Department has privatized most of its CONUS-based housing, a primary role for 
the Office of the Secretary of Defense is to ensure these projects maintain quality housing where 
3 
 
military families will enjoy living while sustaining the projects’ long-term financial viability.  To 
support this goal, the Department is requesting $3.5 million to help administer the Military 
Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) program.  These funds are critical for us to monitor 
MHPI project financial health; respond to Office of the Management and Budget guidance 
related to oversight of federal credit including annual credit subsidy re-estimates for government 
direct loans and loan guarantees; and conduct analyses of MHPI projects under financial stress 
that may require a restructure or modification (e.g., as a result of hurricane damage).  Our 
oversight of the MHPI program includes privatized family and unaccompanied housing, as well 
as lodging the Army privatized at 40 U.S. installations over the last 13 years. 
 
Military Housing Privatization Initiative  
 
Under the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) legislation established in 1996, the 
Military Departments have privatized 99 percent (more than 200,000 units) of installation family 
housing in the U.S., with more than 80 MHPI projects currently in place across approximately 
150 installations.   
 
The Department is confident that housing privatization was the right thing to do.  Privatization 
has dramatically improved the quality of on-base housing and has facilitated the long-term 
investment necessary to maintain high quality housing.  The MHPI allowed the Military 
Departments to leverage private sector expertise and funding to improve the quality of 
installation housing in the United States much faster than DoD could have done through 
traditional military construction and ongoing operation and maintenance funding.   
 
Under the MHPI, Military Departments conveyed their existing government housing units to 
competitively selected privatization entities (i.e., the MHPI projects).  MHPI projects operate 
under long-term (~50-year) ground leases and associated legal agreements with a Military 
Department, with one 25-year option period.  In return, the MHPI projects assumed ownership of 
the houses and the responsibility for operation, maintenance, construction, and replacement of 
the housing during the lease term, in accordance with the authorities as defined in Title 10, 
United States Code.   
 
In light of the media reports and recent hearings on the poor conditions and service some military 
families experienced over the last several years, I am increasing the oversight my office provides 
to ensure the Military Departments fully and effectively exercise their responsibilities to ensure 
that privatized housing is managed in a manner protective of human health and the environment.  
This includes establishing new reporting requirements and programmatic reviews regarding 
Military Department monitoring of potential hazards in privatized housing, such as reporting on 
the number of child falls from windows in MHPI (or military-operated) housing. 
 
The Department and our housing privatization partners are committed to working together to 
increase our collective communication with military families to better ensure they have a 
positive experience living in privatized housing.  This will start with the issuance of a Resident 
Bill of Rights.  We will be working with Congress, the Military Departments, the privatized 
housing owners, and military families to articulate the responsibilities and expectations between 
renters and lessors.  We will also be increasing our engagement with military families throughout 
4 
 
their residency.  Through increased engagement, we will better educate military families about 
their roles and responsibilities to help identify any issues with housing conditions, and the roles 
and responsibilities of the privatized partner and the installation housing teams.  Our 
commitment to increase engagement also extends to Military and Veteran Support Organizations 
and advocacy groups such as the Military Family Advisory Network.       
 
In all cases, we commit to work with our housing privatization partners to ensure any and all 
resident concerns are addressed in a highly responsive, timely and professional manner, with 
emphasis on expediting resolution of any concerns involving potential health or safety issues.  
We want our military families to know that we truly care about their experience living in 
privatized housing and that we want to collectively do better in delivering safe, high quality, 
affordable housing where our military members and their families will want and choose to live. 
 
The Department of Defense understands that the family is important, and we honor the sacrifice 
that Service members and their families make to serve our nation.  The Department recognizes 
we have a moral obligation to military families to provide safe and quality housing, and we take 
that obligation seriously.  We are committed to the long-term success of the MHPI projects and 
MHPI program, and will continue our oversight of the MHPI portfolio to ensure delivery of 
quality housing for Service members and their families over the life of the projects.  Bottom line, 
this requires a twin focus: ensuring our residents have a positive experience living in privatized 
housing, and ensuring the long-term viability of the MHPI projects for future military families.   
 
Facilities Sustainment and Recapitalization 
 
In order for the Department’s facilities to support the goals of the National Defense Strategy, 
they must be well maintained and renovated periodically.  Over the last two years, the 
Department has increased its funding to sustain and modernize existing facilities.  While our 
Components must still take risks in maintaining facilities, this budget request continues to 
improve our overall funding and reduce risk in our most important infrastructure. 
 
Facility Sustainment funding, which includes the regularly scheduled maintenance and repair or 
replacement of facility components, is the foundation of the Department's investment to maintain 
the condition of our facilities. These periodic and predictable investments must be made across 
the service life of a facility to slow its deterioration and optimize its performance to support the 
safety, productivity, and quality of life of our personnel, while also reducing long-term 
recapitalization requirements.  The Department’s Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funding 
for Facility Sustainment in the FY 2020 budget request is $10.4 billion, representing a seven 
percent increase compared to our FY 2019 budget request. This investment improves our 
collective sustainment rate to over 86% of our Facilities Sustainment Model requirement.  This is 
still short of our 90% goal, but nonetheless represents significant movement in the right 
direction. 
 
In addition to Sustainment funding, Restoration and Modernization funding enables renovations 
and upgrades to ensure a facility can support assigned missions.  Thanks to authority provided in 
the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, the DoD Components are increasing their 
pursuit of opportunities to more cost-effectively repurpose existing facilities to accommodate 
5 
 
new missions.  Our FY 2020 budget request includes almost $5 billion in the Operations and 
Maintenance account for facilities restoration and modernization, an increase of almost 80 
percent over our FY 2019 request.  As with our sustainment program, this also represents 
movement in the right direction to address the backlog of requirements in aging and obsolete 
facilities.  
   
 
Environmental and Safety Programs 
 
Installations are key platforms for our nation’s defense.  Therefore, we must make them resilient 
and a “safe” place for not only our service members, but their families living on our installations 
and our surrounding communities.  The Department’s environmental investments support these 
objectives through activities ranging from managing critical habitat and avoiding training 
restrictions to addressing drinking water health advisories and making the best use of limited 
cleanup dollars.  The President’s FY 2020 Budget requests $3.6 billion for environmental 
programs, which is an increase of $185 million compared to the FY 2019 request. 
 
We are requesting $1.3 billion to continue cleanup efforts at the remaining Installation 
Restoration Program (IRP) sites and Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP) sites. The 
IRP is focused on cleanup of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants, while the 
MMRP is focused on responding to unexploded ordnance and munition constituents at former 
military ranges.  This includes $1.1 billion for “Environmental Restoration,” which encompasses 
active installations and Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS – sites that DoD transferred to other 
Federal agencies, States, local governments, or private landowners before October 17, 1986).  
The remaining $254 million is for “BRAC Environmental.” 
 
Progress Towards Cleanup Goals 
Goal: Achieve Response Complete at 90% and 95% of Active and BRAC IRP and MMRP 
sites, and FUDS IRP sites, by FY 2018 and FY 2021, respectively

By the end of 2018, the Department, in cooperation with State agencies and the Environmental 
Protection Agency, completed cleanup activities at 88 percent of Active and BRAC IRP and 
MMRP sites, and FUDS IRP sites, and is now monitoring the results.  During FY 2018 alone, the 
Department completed cleanup at over 469 sites.  Of the roughly 39,500 restoration sites, more 
than 33,500 are now in monitoring status or have completed cleanup. 
 
Our focus remains on continuous improvement in the restoration program: minimizing overhead; 
adopting new technologies to reduce cost and accelerate cleanup; refining and standardizing our 
6 
 
cost estimating; and improving our relationships with State regulators through increased 
dialogue.  All of these initiatives help ensure that we make the best use of our available resources 
to complete cleanup. 
 
However, challenges remain that slow our progress.  For example, unregulated or emerging 
chemicals of concern, such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid 
(PFOA), are becoming a top priority and require the DoD to reprioritize or reopen previously 
made decisions which will cause delays in achieving our goals.  Additionally, some sites have no 
feasible solution to clean up the contamination, and as a result, the Department is making 
significant investments in environmental technology to identify new potential remediation 
methods. 
 
Environmental Technology 
 
A critical part of DoD's approach to meeting its environmental obligations and improving its 
performance is the continued pursuit of advances in science and technology.  The Department 
has a thirty-year record of researching, developing, and transferring innovative environmental 
technologies from the laboratory to actual use in the field.  Many of these technologies are also 
now widely used by other federal agencies and industry, benefitting the nation as a whole. 
 
The overall FY 2020 budget request for Environmental Technology is $178 million, centered on 
two key programs - the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP - 
focused on basic and applied research) and the Environmental Security Technology Certification 
Program (ESTCP - focused on validating more mature technologies to transition them to 
widespread use).  The FY 2020 budget request includes $66 million for SERDP and $39 million 
for ESTCP for environmental technology demonstrations, with an additional $27 million 
requested specifically for energy technology demonstrations. These Defense-wide environmental 
technology programs coordinate closely with the Military Services to ensure research, 
demonstration, test and evaluation are focused on the Departments most pressing environmental 
needs. 
 
These programs have already achieved noticeable results and have the potential to significantly 
reduce long-term costs by implementing new ways of treating groundwater contamination, to 
increasing training land availability by developing more effective management strategies for 
installation managers, and to reduce the life-cycle costs of multiple weapons systems through 
development and demonstration of innovative coatings and materials.  During the past two years, 
we have also launched an aggressive initiative to address management issues associated with the 
use of Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) including development of fluorine-free alternatives 
for AFFF, as well as development of more efficient and cost-effective sampling, analysis, and 
treatment options for AFFF-related chemicals including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), 
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and related per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).  In the 
critical area of installation energy, we are focused on proving technologies and solutions that 
cost-effectively improve the energy security and resiliency of our installations, and that protect 
our energy assets and facilities from cyber-attacks.

Improving Installation and Climate Resilience 
 
DoD must adapt current and future operations to address a variety of threats and increase the 
resilience of our installations. We recognize the effects of a changing climate are a national 
security issue with potential impacts to Department of Defense missions, operational plans, and 
installations. We have been and will continue to be proactive in developing comprehensive 
policy, guidance, and tools to mitigate these impacts, with a focus on robust infrastructure, sound 
land management policies, and increased energy resilience.   
 
From a resources perspective, DoD is incorporating climate resilience as a cross-cutting 
consideration for our planning and decision-making processes, and not as a separate program or 
specific set of actions.  Specifically, the Department considers resilience in the installation 
planning and basing processes.  This includes consideration of environmental vulnerabilities in 
installation master planning, management of natural resources, design and construction 
standards, utility systems and service, as well as emergency management operations. 
The Department has been proactive in developing policy, guidance, and tools to mitigate the 
impacts of a changing climate. These mitigation strategies focus on infrastructure and land 
management.   
 
From a policy perspective, the Department has published several issuances to ensure the Services 
and Joint Staff integrate climate scenarios into planning.  DoD Directive 4715.21, Climate 
Change Adaption and Resilience, assigns responsibilities to components to incorporate climate 
considerations into planning for infrastructure and operations.  DoD Instruction 4715.03, Natural 
Resources Conservation Program, requires consideration of climate impacts during development 
of Installations Natural Resources Management Plans. In 2017, the Department updated DoDI 
6055.17, DoD Emergency Management Program, to ensure the consideration of an all hazards 
approach to manage risks, including weather and climate related impacts on military 
installations.  
  
Additionally, the Department regularly updates its building codes, known as Unified Facilities 
Criteria (UFCs), to reflect updated or more stringent industry and Federal standards.  Over the 
past year, DoD has updated the Master Planning and High Performance and Sustainable Building 
Requirements UFCs to strengthen climate considerations.  The Department has and will continue 
to develop tools for installation planners and engineers to assess climate impacts and develop 
mitigation strategies. Recent examples include The Planning Handbook on Climate Change 
Installation Adaptation and Resilience, produced by Naval Facilities Command (NAVFAC) in 
January 2017, and the Coastal Assessment Regional Scenarios Database (CARSWG) database 
with regionalized sea level scenarios for DoD sites worldwide. 
 
Environmental Conservation and Compatible Development 
 
The Department continues to manage its land, water, and airspace to ensure our military and 
civilian personnel have the access they need to conduct mission-essential activities.  As training, 
testing, and operational requirements expand and new weapons systems are introduced, access 
and use of ranges becomes increasingly important.  The FY 2020 budget request for 
8 
 
Conservation is $445 million.  The Department will invest these funds to maximize our 
flexibility to use lands for military purposes and to address incompatible land uses beyond our 
fence lines. 
 
The Department’s lands and waters are vital to readiness. However, they also support a diverse 
array of fish and wildlife species, including nearly 500 that are federally protected under the 
Endangered Species Act, and over 550 that are at risk of needing listing protection.  Managing 
for healthy and resilient natural landscapes, such as reducing fire risks, avoiding wildlife 
conflicts, removing invasive species, and improving range and training areas, provides the 
conditions necessary for mission-essential activities. 
 
Regulatory protections related to threatened and endangered species and their habitats can pose 
significant mission challenges by restricting use of our existing ranges and training areas, or 
limiting our development of new infrastructure.  In recent years, there has been a marked 
increase in the number of species being petitioned and evaluated for listing under the Endangered 
Species Act.  To better address these issues, we have initiated a partnership with the Department 
of the Interior to target conservation efforts for species of primary concern to the Department.  
The three primary goals of this initiative are to facilitate species recovery and de-listing, 
establish local and regional partnerships to recover species or prevent new species from being 
listed, and to develop innovative tools and approaches that provide greater regulatory 
predictability. 
 
The Department’s participation in broader conservation partnerships for listed species is 
beginning to see returns on those long term investments.  This past year the Lesser Long-Nosed 
Bat, a species that resides on three Southwest installations, was considered recovered and 
removed from the list of threatened and endangered species.  This success alleviated training 
restrictions related to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations and use of pyrotechnics on 
18,743 acres at Fort Huachuca, AZ.  Four additional species are also currently being evaluated or 
have been proposed for either a status change from endangered to threatened, or removal from 
the list of threatened and endangered species.   
 
Building on this success, we will continue to work with our federal, state and non-governmental 
partners to develop new and innovative regulatory approaches that streamline processes and 
provide greater mission flexibility.  We will also be working to develop more comprehensive 
initiatives that better capitalize on both our on-installation conservation programs and our off-
installation conservation partnerships through the Readiness and Environmental Protection 
Integration Program.  
 
Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Program 
 
The Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) program supports DoD’s efforts 
to build a more lethal and resilient force.  Investments protect training, testing, and operational 
assets of the Department, contributing to installation resilience and sustainment of existing and 
new mission capabilities.  Through the REPI program, we engage in a long-term and cooperative 
strategy to ensure military mission sustainability by limiting incompatible development near our 
installations and ranges.  Protecting these lands using the REPI program is a more cost-effective 
9 
 
approach to sustain military readiness for the Department and the taxpayer than settling for 
suboptimal test and training alternatives or workarounds, such as replacing compromised assets 
with new range construction or relocating missions. This cooperative land protection also 
provides direct benefits to our partners and neighboring communities through the conservation of 
limited resources shared by the installation and its neighbors. REPI initiatives contribute to the 
longevity of working farms, forests, and ranchlands; increase recreational opportunities for 
nearby residents, active military families, and veterans; and increase the installation’s military 
value. The REPI program invigorates public-private partnerships that strengthen military 
installation ties to local communities. These local alliances help to foster an increased level of 
communication and cooperation, which enables installation commanders to better accomplish 
their vital test, training, and operational missions.   In the last 16 years, REPI partnerships have 
protected more than 586,000 acres of land around 106 installations in 33 states.  In addition to 
the tangible benefits of preserving DoD’s existing training, testing, and operational assets, these 
efforts have resulted in significant contributions to the economic health and recreational 
opportunities for local communities.   
 
One example of a REPI initiative is working to sustain the F-35 mission at Hill Air Force Base 
(AFB).  Located in the fastest developing locale in the state of Utah, Hill AFB anticipates that 
without the REPI program, the arrival of the F-35 will face significant encroachment challenges 
in the next 5-10 years.  Challenges such as public safety concerns, noise and nighttime lighting 
complaints, and water availability pose potential threats to the F-35 mission.  Experts at Hill 
AFB say flight test patterns may have to be rerouted or aircraft launch hours may have to be 
restricted without encroachment mitigation. 
 
In addition to directly preserving and enhancing key mission capabilities through innovative 
partnerships, the REPI program has developed an approach that supports land use and habitat 
conservation practices beyond installation boundaries to ensure military installations do not 
become refuges of last resort for threatened, endangered, or at-risk species.  Under this approach, 
DoD engages with other governmental and non-governmental partners who work with private 
landowners to develop voluntary initiatives and agreements that promote practices that help 
avoid or mitigate regulatory restrictions on training, testing, and operations on DoD lands.  These 
efforts ease the on-installation species management burden and reduce the possibility of 
restricted activities. 
 
Within the Department’s $445 million budget for conservation, $75 million is directed to the 
REPI program.  The REPI program is a cost-effective tool to protect the nation’s existing 
training, testing, and operational capabilities at a time of decreasing resources.  
 
To further REPI investments, DoD, along with the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture, 
continues to advance the Sentinel Landscapes Partnership to work with private and non-Federal 
landowners to conserve large landscapes where conservation, working lands, and national 
defense interests converge.  Established in 2013, the Sentinel Landscapes Partnership further 
strengthens interagency coordination and provides taxpayers with the greatest leverage of their 
funds by aligning federal programs to advance the mutually beneficial goals of each agency. 
From 2014 through 2018, seven Sentinel Landscapes have been designated.  In 2018, DoD and 
the Military Services invested approximately $22 million in the seven Sentinel Landscapes, 
10 
 
which will further leverage funds from federal, state, local, and private partners.  In 2018, the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service awarded $7 million in 
Regional Conservation Partnership Program funding to develop the North Carolina Sentinel 
Landscapes High Priority Protect Program.  The investments made in Sentinel Landscapes help 
ensure readiness and protect operational flexibility. 
  
Addressing Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) 
 
Ensuring the health and safety of our Service members, the families living on our installations, 
and the surrounding communities is one of our top priorities.  This includes the investigation and 
cleanup of PFOS and PFOA in drinking water where previous Department of Defense activities 
are determined to be the source.  DoD has committed substantial resources in the last three years 
and has taken significant actions to respond to concerns with PFOS and PFOA. 
 
One commercial product that contains PFOS and PFOA is Aqueous Film Forming Foam, or 
AFFF.  Besides DoD, this highly effective firefighting foam has been used by airports, fire 
departments, and the oil and gas industry, among others.  However, AFFF only accounted for 
approximately 3-6% of PFOS production in 2000 and DoD is just one of many users. 
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) 
provides a consistent approach across the Nation for cleanup.  This includes prioritizing sites for 
cleanup using the CERCLA risk-based process – essentially worst first. The Defense 
Environmental Restoration Program statute provides authorities to DoD to perform and fund 
cleanup actions and requires they be carried out in accordance with CERCLA.  The first step is 
to identify known or suspected releases.  DoD has identified 401 active and Base Realignment 
and Closure installations with at least one area where there is a known or suspected release of 
PFOS or PFOA.  The Military Departments then determined if there was exposure through 
drinking water.  If so, DoD’s priority is to quickly address unacceptable levels of PFOS/PFOA in 
drinking water.  As of today, no one is drinking water above EPA’s drinking water lifetime 
health advisory of 70ppt where DoD is the known source. 
 
With the exposure pathway broken, the Military Departments are prioritizing sites for further 
action using the longstanding CERCLA risk-based process – essentially worst first.  These 
known or suspected PFOS and PFOA release areas are in various stages of assessment, 
investigation, and cleanup.  As DoD moves through the CERCLA process, we will work in 
collaboration with regulatory agencies and communities, and share information in an open and 
transparent manner. We are committed to funding the remainder of assessments and 
investigations as we move into the later phases of CERCLA process. 
 
DoD has also committed significant funds in research and development to identify and test 
fluorine-free AFFF. As previously discussed, our SERDP and ESTCP programs launched 
numerous efforts and on-going projects from small scale to field demonstrations.  At the 
conclusion of these projects, the Department will have invested $60 million in PFAS-related 
research and development, with additional research and demonstration projects under 
consideration for funding beginning in FY 2020.  
 
11 
 
We have already taken steps to remove and replace AFFF containing PFOS from our supply 
system and to prevent new releases of AFFF.  The Military Departments no longer use AFFF for 
maintenance, testing, and training activities.  When AFFF is used to fight a fire, it is contained to 
prevent releases to ground water. 
 
Currently, no fluorine-free version of AFFF meets the military’s stringent performance 
requirements to extinguish petroleum fires.  We have solicited research projects to identify and 
test the performance of fluorine-free AFFF.  These efforts support DoD’s commitment to finding 
an AFFF alternative that meets critical mission requirements, while protecting human health and 
the environment, and will represent $10 million in research and development funding. 
 
In summary, DoD is taking immediate actions to reduce the risks from PFOS and PFOA.  Our 
efforts reinforce DoD’s commitment to meeting critical mission requirements while protecting 
human health and the environment.  The Department recognizes that this is a national problem 
involving a wide array of industries and commercial applications, as well as many federal and 
state agencies.  Therefore, it needs a nation-wide regulatory solution. 
 
 
Department of Defense Energy Programs 
 
Energy is an essential enabler of military capability and the Department depends on energy-
resilient forces and facilities to achieve its mission.  In FY 2018, the Department consumed over 
85 million barrels of fuel to power ships, aircraft, combat vehicles, and contingency bases at a 
cost of nearly $9.2 billion.  At over 500 worldwide military installations, the Department spent 
$3.4 billion in FY 2018 on energy to power over 585,000 facilities and 160,000 non-tactical 
vehicles.   
 
The National Defense Strategy outlines an operational environment where “every domain is 
contested – air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace,"" and the “homeland is no longer a sanctuary.”  
Preparing for the battlefield of 2025 and sustaining installation and operational energy resilience 
necessitates the assured delivery of cyber-secure fuel and power in contested environments 
against near-peer competitors.   
 
To enable resilient, efficient, and cyber-secure energy for Joint forces, weapon systems and 
installations, the FY 2020 President’s Budget includes approximately $4.2 billion in energy 
investments, including both operational energy (the energy required for training, moving, and 
sustaining military forces and weapons platforms for military operations) and installation energy 
(the energy used to power permanent installations and non-tactical fleet vehicles).   
 
In support of operational energy, the Department is requesting $3.5 billion to upgrade and 
procure new equipment, improve propulsion, adapt plans, concepts, and plan wargames to 
account for increasing risks to logistics and sustainment, and enhance how the Department 
considers energy in developing new capabilities.  As the Department responds to changing 
threats in Europe, the Indo-Pacific, and the Middle East, these initiatives are increasing 
capability and decreasing risks for warfighters deployed around the globe.  
 
12 
 
In support of installation energy, the Department is requesting $698 million to for energy 
resilience and energy conservation initiatives, most of which are directed to existing buildings.  
This includes $548 million in the Military Component Operations and Maintenance accounts for 
sustainment and recapitalization projects, which generally involve retrofits to install improved 
lighting, high-efficiency HVAC systems, double-pane windows, energy management control 
systems, and new roofs.  The remainder ($150 million) is for the Energy Resilience and 
Conservation Investment Program (ERCIP), which is a MILCON account that funds projects to 
improve energy resilience and security, save energy and water, reduce energy costs, and most 
importantly, contribute to the mission readiness of our military installations.  
 
Our mission is to sustain warfighting readiness and lethality by providing all energy-related 
policy and governance for programs and activities that enable resilient, efficient, and cyber-
secure energy for Joint forces, weapon systems and installations.  To do so, the FY 2020 
President’s Budget supports initiatives across four primary areas, outlined below. 
 
Energy Resilience 
 
As defined in Section 101 of Title 10, energy resilience is the “ability to avoid, prepare for, 
minimize, adapt to, and recover from anticipated and unanticipated energy disruptions in order to 
ensure energy availability and reliability sufficient to provide for mission assurance and 
readiness, including mission essential operations related to readiness, and to execute or rapidly 
reestablish mission essential requirements.”  To this end, the Department has been engaged in the 
following programs that increase energy resilience for our weapons systems and installations. 
 
Energy Resilience and Conservation Investment Program (ERCIP).  ERCIP is a key Department 
tool to enable more robust energy security.  DoD is requesting $150 million for this program for 
FY 2020, including $113 million for energy resilience projects and $37 million for energy 
conservation projects.  The ERCIP portfolio has a combined Savings to Investment Ratio (SIR) 
of 1.63.  In other words, every dollar we invest in ERCIP is returned to the Department with a 
discounted cost savings of $1.63 over the lifetime of the project, demonstrating that, in many 
cases, energy resilience does not have to come at a price premium. For example, at Beale Air 
Force Base, ERCIP funding will provide an electrical substation which will provide a secondary 
source of power from an alternate power provider to ensure the Global Hawk mission has the 
reliable power it needs.  At Anniston Army Depot, the project will provide on-site generation 
and grid controls which assure critical production and maintenance of combat vehicles during 
extended grid outages.  Both projects provide improved energy resilience to their critical 
missions. 
 
Micro-reactor Demonstration.  As directed in the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, 
DoD and DoE are in the planning stages for a pilot program to demonstrate a commercially 
developed, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensed, micro-reactor to power critical 
loads at a permanent domestic military installation by December 2027.  The demonstration will 
evaluate the energy resilience capability and the cost effectiveness of micro-reactor technology.    
 
 
13 
 
Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF).  Overseen by the Under Secretary 
of Defense for Research & Engineering, OECIF supports operational energy research programs.  
The FY 2020 President's Budget requests $70 million to initiate new projects and sustain projects 
started in FYs 2017-2019.  Ongoing initiatives include efforts to increase the energy performance 
of unmanned systems, enhance power and thermal management for high pulse power weapons, 
wirelessly transmitting energy in the far field, and one-year analytical studies to identify 
operational energy science and technology gaps.   
 
Installation Energy Resilience Policy and Governance.  The Military Departments continue to 
implement energy resilience initiatives aligned with Department of Defense Instruction 4170.11, 
Installation Energy Management.  This is the first policy the Department issued to define energy 
resilience; critical energy requirements; and operation, maintenance, and testing requirements for 
energy resilient systems.   
 
Standardized Mobile Electric Power Systems.  In August 2018, the Department established a 
DoD family of mobile electric power generation, distribution, storage, and management systems.  
This policy addresses the growing need for power at contingency bases with a standardized, 
interoperable, and maintainable family of equipment, while allowing mission-driven exceptions.  
The effort decreases the logistics burden – and risk – for deployed forces while enabling 
advanced equipment to reach the field at lower cost in less time.  
 
Installation Energy Plans. The Department’s ongoing energy efficiency efforts not only 
contribute to energy resilience by reducing critical loads, but have also lowered our base 
operating costs by $5.4 billion since FY 2005.  In May 2018, the Department expanded its 
Installation Energy Plan (IEP) policy to require the integration of energy resilience and 
cybersecurity at all installations.  The process of comprehensive energy planning will provide a 
holistic approach to identifying, evaluating, and mitigating energy risks to critical missions. The 
IEPs are slated for completion by the end of FY 2021. 
 
Training and Education.  Across the Force, there is a need for uniformed and civilian personnel 
who are prepared to develop and implement effective solutions for energy resilience and 
cybersecurity.  For civilian and military installation energy managers, we finalized the Energy 
Manager Competency Model.  Additionally, we foster collaboration among the Sustainment 
organization, the Department of Energy, and other agencies to communicate key priorities and 
coordinate inter-departmental events. For example, the annual Energy Exchange, Defense 
Logistics Agency’s Worldwide Energy Conference, and the Federal Utility Partnership Working 
Group, provide relevant training for our workforce.  In addition, for uniformed personnel, we are 
working to bolster energy-informed, risk-based decisions by expanding the Defense Logistic 
Agency’s Joint Petroleum Seminar and Joint Petroleum Officers Course.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14 
 
Energy Risk 
 
To prioritize resources, the Department is identifying, assessing, and integrating energy-related 
analyses and risks into Department decision-making, as follows: 
 
Energy Informed Wargames.  To better evaluate and mitigate the effects of energy disruptions on 
the mission, we are actively engaged in integrating energy risks into our wargames and exercises.  
In 2018, my office participated in three events sponsored by the Army, Defense Logistics 
Agency, and USTRANSCOM.  With the integration of realistic constraints to logistics capacity 
and threats to our fuel storage and distribution, our efforts will improve Department decision-
making in operation plans, concept and capability development, and program investments.  
Looking ahead, the Department anticipates executing a Joint energy wargame by the end of FY 
2019 that evaluates energy risks in the Indo-Pacific area of operations.  
 
Energy Resilience Exercises.  In alignment with U.S. Code and DoD instruction, we are 
performing full-scale and black-start energy disruption exercises of our energy resilience and 
backup power systems to evaluate risks to the readiness of our military installations.  In FYs 
2018 and 2019, the Department will have completed three tabletop exercise and five black-start 
readiness exercise tests at critical military installations.  There is another planned black-start 
readiness exercise to be completed by the conclusion of FY 2020.   
 
Energy Resilience Tools and Analyses.  The Department continues to identify and develop 
critical energy requirements, models, and metrics for decision-making across the installation and 
operational energy portfolios.  For installation energy, the DoD commissioned the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory (MIT-LL) to address a congressional requirement to 
evaluate the costs, risks, and benefits associated with energy resilience and mission readiness 
against energy supply disruptions on military facilities and installations.  Site-level assessments 
conducted across a number of military installations identified critical energy requirements and 
metrics for the purposes of identifying energy resilience projects.  Also, the life-cycle cost 
analysis tool, which assesses tradeoffs between mission performance and costs, is now being 
assessed for enterprise-wide adoption across the Department.   
 
Energy Performance 
 
The Department continues to leverage alternative financing authorities that ensure lower cost, 
resilient energy performance across DoD installations.  Through mechanisms such as power 
purchase agreements, performance-based contracts, enhanced use leases, utility energy service 
contracts (UESCs), utilities privatization, and energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs), 
the Department has awarded over three billion dollars in alternative finance contracts to ensure 
energy performance, efficiency, and resilience on our military installations since 2011.  In 
accordance with more recent congressional direction, the Department issued revised policy to 
integrate energy resilience and cybersecurity considerations into these alternative financing 
mechanisms.  
 
The Department takes full advantage of non-Federal financing for distributed energy projects to 
ensure the energy resilience of our installations.  This approach minimizes DoD capital 
15 
 
investment by using contracts that incentivize industry to fund infrastructure resilience 
improvements.  When the business case supports it, the Department pursues distributed energy 
projects with microgrid-ready applications able to sustain continuous power in the event of a 
disruption.  Both the Air Force at Hill Air Force Base and the Army at Fort Huachuca awarded 
ESPCs last year, which included implementation of on-site generation.  In addition, the project at 
Fort Huachuca includes a microgrid, which will ensure the delivery of available, reliable, and 
resilient power while reducing life cycle costs through an ESPC with our industry partners.   
 
Further, my Energy team is conducting a Defense Energy Resilience Bank study, also known as 
the DERB, to review best practices from the commercial finance industry and lenders to 
implement and accelerate alternative finance for energy resilience project development. This 
multi-stakeholder collaboration with government and industry partners is critical to develop 
integrated and holistic alternative finance projects that ensure the Department’s energy resilience 
objectives are met cost effectively. 
 
Cyber Secure Facilities 
 
Reflecting the role of our facilities as nodes for projecting and sustaining power, the Department 
is reducing the cyber risks to facility related control systems (FRCS) to ensure reliable power for 
critical missions.  Similar to our approach to energy resilience, the department integrated cyber 
security into our energy policies and guidance of the course of the last year. For example our 
military installations are including cyber security considerations in the development of their 
installation energy plans, along with the pursuit of alternative finance. Specifically, FRCS 
considerations are now integral to utility privatization agreements, ESPCs, and UESCs.  
 
Further, to build a FRCS defense posture, the Department recently began developing 
cybersecurity plans to account for the capabilities and resources required to implement controls 
on its highest prioritized assets and systems.  We will continue to work with the Department’s 
Chief Information Officer and Principal Cyber Advisor toward solutions and resources ensuring 
FRCS are defensible, survivable, and resilient to operate and sustain critical functions in a cyber-
contested environment.  Additionally, in July 2018, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a 
memorandum, Enhancing Cybersecurity Risk Management for Control Systems (CS) Supporting 
DoD Owned Defense Critical Infrastructure, mandating the Components cyber secure these 
critical systems.  
 
 
Additional High Interest Programs  
 
Border Security   
 
On April 4, 2018, the President directed the Secretary of Defense to support the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) in securing the southern border, including assistance to “stop the flow 
of deadly drugs and other contraband, gang members and other criminals, and illegal aliens into 
the country.”  
 
16 
 
On February 15, 2019, the President declared that a national emergency exists at the southern 
border of the United States that requires the use of the armed forces, making available certain 
emergency authorities, including Section 2808 of Title 10, U.S. Code.   
 
Section 2808 provides that, in the event of a national emergency declaration requiring use of 
armed forces, “the Secretary of Defense, without regard to any other provision of law, may 
undertake military construction projects, and may authorize the Secretaries of the military 
departments to undertake military construction projects, not otherwise authorized by law that are 
necessary to support such use of the armed forces.”   
 
At this time, the Acting Secretary has not decided whether use of Section 2808 authorities is 
necessary.  No military construction funds may be obligated under Section 2808 unless the 
Acting Secretary determines that military construction projects are necessary to support the use 
of the armed forces in addressing the national emergency for which the armed forces are 
required.  To inform his decision, the Acting Secretary has requested from DHS a list of 
proposed border barrier construction projects, prioritized in order of effectiveness, that DHS 
considers to be most effective in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of DoD personnel 
supporting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and securing the southern border.  DHS 
provided its input to DoD on March 20, 2019. 
 
In support of the Acting Secretary’s consideration of Section 2808, DoD is conducting a 
deliberate process to identify MILCON projects that could be used as funding sources, if 
necessary, for MILCON projects to support the use of the armed forces in connection with the 
national emergency. Should the Acting Secretary determine that use of Section 2808 authorities 
is necessary, we will provide you the information on affected projects as soon as it is available. 
 
Additionally, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is supporting Secretary of Defense-approved 
Requests for Assistance from the Department of Homeland Security via validated and Service-
funded requisitions.  As of February 28, 2019, DLA has provided over $7.7 million worth of 
Class IV materials for the construction of 202 miles of fencing, in addition to over $3 million in 
subsistence, $56K in clothing and individual equipment, and $3.3 million of re-utilized material 
in support of operations.  DLA remains well positioned to support additional requirements. 
 
Military Construction Reform 
 
Reform of the military construction process, although not represented as a budget request item, 
continues as an important effort of my office.  Our goal is nothing less than to ensure warfighters 
are provided delivery of fully-mission-capable facilities within the timelines stated.  We are 
looking for ways to reduce cost where possible, but perhaps more importantly, to improve 
communication between stakeholders and timeliness of completed facilities which fully meet 
user requirements over their expected service lives.  We are continuing our proactive assessment 
of recent challenges in MilCon project delivery and program management to identify 
improvements in the MilCon process and implement reforms in a number of key areas, to 
include: improving identification of project requirements; enhancing collaboration between 
resource sponsors, end users, and construction agents to ensure projects meet mission 
requirements within budget constraints; selecting the best engineering and acquisition strategy to 
17 
 
cost-effectively meet mission requirements; identifying risk mitigation measures before cost or 
schedule changes adversely impact the mission; and increasing awareness and accountability at 
all levels of management and performance as problems arise. The Department is also consulting 
with our industry partners to identify commercial best practices to lower costs, save time, 
measure performance differently, and improve project quality in support of the warfighter. 
 
Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) 
 
As Acting Secretary Shanahan recently testified, China’s increasingly provocative behavior in 
the Indo-Pacific, particularly in the South China Sea (SCS) should concern us all.  Between 2013 
and 2018, China increased its air and sea incursions into the SCS twelvefold. Our posture in the 
Indo-Pacific, specifically in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands 
(CNMI) continues to be critical to countering China’s influence.   
 
The Department continues to work on the relocation of approximately 5,000 Marines from 
Okinawa to Guam.  This initiative reduces the burden on our Japanese allies, while bolstering 
regional security in the Pacific. Its focus is on sustaining a forward-deployed responsive force 
that counters the reach of the People’s Republic of China, the aggressions of North Korea, and 
other regional threats, while ensuring the capability to provide regional support at a moment’s 
notice.  Marine Corps forces realigning in the Pacific will establish an improved force 
composition, installation construction and modernization, and new strategic hubs, of which 
Guam will be the most significant. This venture between the U.S. and the Government of Japan 
will enhance interoperability and strengthen deterrence in the Indo-Pacific Region. 
 
The main cantonment area on Guam for the Marine Corps will be known as Marine Corps Base 
Blaz, to honor Marine Brigadier General Vicente “Ben” Tomas Garrido Blaz, the highest ranking 
Chamorro to have served in the Marines, located at Finegayan in the Northwest.  We are still in 
the land clearing phase of construction with approximately 85 percent of land clearing complete.  
The North Ramp of Andersen Air Force Base (AAFB) will be home to the USMC Air Combat 
Element housing the MV-22 (Osprey), the H-1, and the CH-53 platforms.  Hangar 1, which 
houses the Ospreys is completed and operational.  Overall, the North Ramp construction is 
approximately 50 percent complete.  AAFB Northfield, which is directly above the cantonment 
area, provides a live-fire training range for small arms and will provide a multi-purpose machine 
gun range. The south side of AAFB will provide urbanized training.  
 
Apra Harbor, located in the southwest of the island, will be a sea embarkation hub.  It will have 
the capability to support all vessels that support USMC operations, black bottom vessels and 
high speed vessels.  Apra Harbor will also provide forces with refueling piers and an ammunition 
wharf.  Improvements at Apra are approximately 60 percent complete. 
 
The relocation is expected to achieve initial support capability in the mid-2020s, contingent on 
affordability and environmental analyses.  The FY 2020 budget request includes $277 million in 
MilCon and Planning & Design funding, including $91.2 million for the second increment of a 
multi-purpose machine gun range on Guam.  Overall, the Government of Japan has committed 
$3.1 billion to fund this relocation and has already transferred $2.023 billion of its commitment 
to the U.S. Treasury.  We are also asking your support to authorize the use of up to $13 million 
18 
 
of funds appropriated in 2014 to mitigate the effects of the military construction workforce on 
the healthcare system of Guam, as identified during the National Environmental Policy Act 
process related to the Marines’ relocation to the Territory. 
   
Another initiative to increase our capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region is the Air Force’s 
construction of facilities and infrastructure for Divert operations at Tinian International Airport.  
The Department signed a lease purchase agreement in November of last year and anticipates 
signing the final lease agreement this May.  This represents a major milestone in one of the more 
challenging transactions we have worked.  Divert operations would occur as training exercises to 
support readiness in the event other locations in the western Pacific are unavailable to support 
standard operations.  For example, humanitarian assistance staging, including noncombatant 
evacuation operations, could also occur at the airport in the event of an emergency or disaster. 
The Divert initiative is estimated to cost ~$380 million.  For FY 2020, the budget request 
includes $316 million to construct fuel tanks, a fuel pipeline, hydrant system, taxiway, and 
parking apron.   
 
As the westernmost U.S. territory in the Pacific, Guam and CNMI offers tremendous potential to 
posture the U.S. for the future, engage with our regional partners, and train to maintain core 
competencies. This is why we continue to pursue live-fire training ranges and training areas in 
the CNMI.  These capabilities would fulfill INDOPACOM training shortfalls and be the only 
U.S. venue to conduct Marine Air Ground Task Force, Joint, and Combined-level live-fire 
amphibious assault and maneuver from the sea, with supporting naval gunfire and close air 
support.  The environmental analysis for this is on-going.  A key element of the analysis is a 
construction capacity study that will forecast the amount of construction activity CNMI can 
support.   
 
I would be remiss if I did not mention the devastation caused by Super Typhoon Yutu.  On 
October, 24, 2018, the Category 5 hurricane-equivalent storm made landfall on CNMI.  Its 180 
mph winds caused devastating destruction in the region and according to the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration, it was the second strongest system to hit U.S. soil in recorded 
history.  However, despite the catastrophic damage from the typhoon, the CNMI has chosen to 
continue moving the Air Force Divert initiative forward, demonstrating the strength of our 
relationship.  
 
Workforce Issues in Guam and Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands  
 
Stable economies in Guam and the CNMI, underpinned by a sustained labor pool, are critical to 
the Department’s ability to implement the National Defense Strategy.  Reliable access to a 
sustained labor pool in these forward-most territories is a national security issue that must be 
addressed if we hope to mitigate expanding Chinese influence and achieve our national security 
objectives in the region.     
 
We thank Congress for the relief provided in the Northern Marianas Island U.S. Workforce Act 
of 2018 passed last July.  Extending the transition period for the full application of federal 
immigration laws by 10 years (to December 31, 2029), and Guam and CNMI’s exemption from 
the H-2B nationwide cap, will buy Guam and the CNMI time to work toward an interagency 
19 
 
endorsed, long-term solution for ensuring sustained access to a viable labor pool  Without long-
term access to a foreign labor pool, the economies of these isolated U.S. territories will suffer 
and the cost of ongoing defense projects could skyrocket beyond their current estimates. 
 
Military Aviation and Installation Assurance Siting Clearinghouse 
 
The Military Aviation and Installation Assurance Siting Clearinghouse continues to protect the 
Department of Defense’s ability to train, test, and operate as the nation expands its renewable 
and other commercial energy development and power transmission.  The Department appreciates 
the statutory changes made by Congress in the FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act to 
codify the Clearinghouse role in DoD’s Title 10 responsibilities, and is actively implementing 
the new requirements to better protect DoD missions.  As an example, the Clearinghouse now 
notifies state Governors and solicits their input on energy projects where DoD has made an 
initial determination that a project will have an adverse impact to a mission.  This increase in 
visibility helps protect DoD missions by identifying any state concerns with an energy project at 
an early point in the review process, as well as by identifying any state procedures that may 
assist DoD in finding a compatible siting solution.   
 
As a result of congressional direction and our own efforts, we are effectively evaluating the 
mission impact of commercial energy projects and implementing affordable and feasible 
mitigation solutions to protect DoD missions.  In CY 2018, the Department reviewed over 5,000 
applications for energy projects through the FAA’s Obstruction Evaluation Process, which 
continues our historical increase of approximately 20% per year.  Of these 5,000 projects, 795 
were wind development projects.  Commercial wind development typically poses the greatest 
compatibility challenge to DoD due to the height and the physical obstruction that wind turbines 
can pose in low level flight routes, and adverse impacts to radar systems.  DoD has resolved 
concerns with numerous energy projects though collaboration between the Clearinghouse, the 
Military Departments, local communities, states, and energy developers, thereby maintaining the 
Department’s ability to train, test, and operate while enabling development of alternative energy 
resources. 
 
Protecting and Enhancing our Training and Test Range Infrastructure 
 
The Clearinghouse is also leading the Department’s efforts to develop a strategic plan for 
training range investments.  In order to ensure that our testing and training range infrastructure is 
sufficient to support the National Defense Strategy, we are assessing our ranges’ ability to 
support training for peer and near-peer adversaries.  This assessment will result in a strategic 
plan for range investment to address identified gaps, improving combat credibility by offering 
opportunities for more realistic maneuver, attack, and opposing force engagement.  The strategic 
plan will be completed in FY 2020 and will complement a parallel assessment of test ranges by 
the Test Resource Management Center. 
 
Accelerating Materiel Readiness Recovery 
 
Accelerating materiel readiness recovery is one of my near-term imperatives in alignment with 
the National Defense Strategy to increase lethality.  Overall sustainment readiness is a 
20 
 
foundational component of military strategy and pacing aspect of producing uninterrupted U.S. 
military capability.  There is no one-size-fits-all approach – no silver bullet solution to the 
challenge before us today.   
 
Effective and efficient public and private industrial capabilities & capacity is the end state we 
seek as the Department’s accountable agent for enterprise level sustainment outcomes.  Our 
strategy for accomplishing this follows three lines of effort; accelerating materiel availability 
improvement, strengthening the viability of the organic industrial base, and operationalizing 
sustainment reforms.  Maintenance, at both the field and depot levels, is foundational to our 
ability to rebuild readiness, as our National Defense Strategy directs us to do.  My team is laser-
focused on getting Mission Capable (MC) and Operational Availability (A ) rates where they 
o
should be – challenging the status quo, reversing negative trends, and driving an aggressive 
reform agenda based on improved data-driven decision-making and leveraging best commercial 
practices.  This is no small task given a $78 billion annual spend for maintenance activities 
alone, and a workforce of over 606 thousand DoD personnel. 
 
You are undoubtedly aware of the 80% Mission Capable memo that was signed this past 
September for F-16, F/A-18, F-22, and F-35 critical aviation assets.  Our intent is to apply that 
same level of attention and visibility across all of our fleets—air, ground, and sea. So let me 
focus on what we are doing at the enterprise level to drive enduring change and improvement.  
Foremost, we are accelerating Materiel Availability improvements across our fielded fleets.  I’ve 
charged my team with setting performance targets and measuring progress across the entire 
enterprise.  I now can access and leverage over 1.5 billion maintenance and supply transactions 
going back to 2005; a virtual goldmine in my estimation.  We are refining our capabilities to 
understand the specific causes of availability loss and/or cost drivers at the enterprise level and 
synthesizing that information to inform decision makers about cost and availability relationships 
for every weapon system. 
 
We are also improving the viability of our organic industrial base capabilities.  While our metrics 
initially focused primarily on mission and field-level outcomes, our next priority is depot 
performance and its contribution to overall supply chain effectiveness.  We are working in 
concert with the Deputy Chief Management Officer’s Cost Management team to map baseline 
costs of material and maintenance operations and to improve enterprise supply demand visibility 
and decision-making.  We are also exploring and applying opportunities for broader application 
of commercial best practices within our public depots and repair activities.   
 
Product Support for Weapons Systems 
 
Sustainment supports Department decision makers with comprehensive, timely, relevant and 
actionable assessments for weapon system development and acquisition.  More specifically, we 
provide the DoD enterprise with policy, processes, guidance and tools that drive effective 
product support planning and execution at best value; and lead the cultural transformation 
necessary to deliver optimal life cycle product support.  
 
As part of these efforts, we are pushing initiatives to address Operating & Support (O&S) Cost 
projections early in the program life-cycle that do not fully capture the cost to achieve the 
21 
 
readiness levels our warfighters need.  Requiring Sustainment Risk and O&S Cost Risk analysis 
significantly earlier than is currently the norm, by the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Phase, will 
enable Affordable Readiness of critical sustainment cost drivers (manpower, spares, 
consumables, and fuel efficiency). In addition to establishing and filling the supply chain, it also 
means establishing essential and early repair capability of depot level reparable and line 
replaceable units (DLR and LRU) by the scheduled Materiel Support Date - well-prior to initial 
operating capability (IOC) plus 4 years.  We must balance near-term production cost with the 
long-range readiness of deployed fleets and fielded systems -- that in reality coexist in the POM 
process.  We also continue to improve policy and governance of the “middle tier acquisition 
authority” granted to the Department by Congress in order to accelerate the delivery of emerging 
capabilities into the hands of the warfighter.  This authority provides streamlined pathways for 
middle tier acquisition technologies that can be prototyped within two to five years, or be put 
into production within six months and completely fielded within five years. 
 
My Product Support team is especially focused on improving aircraft availability and reducing 
sustainment cost for the F-35 program.  We  are working with our allies and partners to develop 
sustainment capabilities where appropriate; supporting numerous ongoing cooperation efforts, 
including information exchanges and engagements to facilitate interoperability and enhance 
relationships; providing logistical expertise to develop partner logistics capacity; and supporting 
Geographic Combatant Commands in developing their country assessments, their Security 
Cooperation Programs, and their Foreign Military Sales packages.   
 
Logistics Support to the Warfighter 
 
The core competencies of Supply, Transportation, Equipment Management, Contingency 
Support, and Logistics Policy and Compliance were integrated under the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for Logistics as part of forming the new Sustainment organization.  The 
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) also performs a critical logistics role as the nation’s combat 
logistics support agency.  DLA manages the global supply chain – from raw materials to end 
user to disposition – for the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, 10 combatant 
commands, other Federal agencies, and partner and allied nations. 
 
We secure our supply chains, institutionalize Operational Contract Support, and implement 
policies and strategies to mitigate threats from vendors in overseas locations.  The Department 
seeks ways to strengthen our supply chains to support critical capabilities.  Logistics personnel 
work closely with the Acquisition community to prevent procurement of counterfeit, defective, 
and malicious material.  Efforts to encourage the development of supply chain standards is 
paying off as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) removed Supply Chain Management 
from its 2019 High Risk Report.  Additionally, DLA supply chains drive over $35 billion in 
goods and services annually, providing 86 percent of the Military Services’ spare parts, and 
nearly 100 percent of fuel.  By staying synchronized with the Services’ plans, DLA will take the 
required steps to proactively acquire and position material for aviation systems, land systems, 
and maritime systems, as well as industrial hardware, clothing and textiles, construction and 
equipment, medical, subsistence, and fuel and energy to ensure the readiness of our military 
forces. 
 
22 
 
Since 2007 the Department has consistently worked to establish Operational Contract Support 
(OCS) as an enduring capability to support current and future operations.  In August 2018, the 
Department began implementing 15 critical actions endorsed by the Joint Requirements 
Oversight Council (JROC) to fully integrate OCS across the Department, to strengthen the ability 
to perform OCS tasks, and ensure OCS supports all phases and ranges of joint military 
operations.  Within OCS, Vendor Threat Mitigation (VTM) is critical.  VTM is the capability to 
identify, assess, and mitigate risks posed by vendors supporting DoD operations outside the 
United States to ensure we do not do business with those entities that support our adversaries.  
Efforts are underway to mitigate risk to operational effectiveness and institutionalize OCS 
solutions by the end of 2022.   
 
We also understand the need to build logistics-related alliances within and outside our Federal 
Government structure and have taken action to build ties with other Agencies, industry leading 
companies, and allies to improve operations.  One partnership success example is the General 
Service Administration (GSA) acquiring more mission support vehicles for conversion from an 
expensive DoD-owned to a DoD-leased fleet.  This action reduced DoD vehicle sustainment cost 
over the past five years by $217M (15.7%).  Additionally, DLA provides some level of materiel 
or service support to about 40 federal agencies, 50 states, 300 localities, and 115 international 
partners.  DLA has the capacity to augment federal contingency responses domestically and 
internationally.  Hurricane-season demand topped $1.2 billion in support in 2017 and $105 
million in 2018.   
 
Another important effort is the Logistic Reform Team, with a focus on identifying common sets 
of metrics and tools to measure and monitor our contribution to warfighting capability in terms 
of availability of weapon systems and cost per day of availability.  Continued support of ongoing 
efforts to reform logistics processes not only increases weapon system readiness, but also drives 
down sustainment costs.  The Team is evaluating sources of sustainment and commodity 
procurement processes, innovating our logistics processes to outpace our adversaries, and 
increasing transparency and governance across the enterprise.   
 
Readiness for the warfighter is also improved through DLA’s organic industrial base program, 
where appropriated funds are used to enable industry a means to meet known surge requirements 
within our long term contracts when they don’t have business case to do so otherwise. 
 
Reaching beyond sustainment organizations, we are partnering with the personnel community to 
improve the military personnel relocation experience by modifying the household goods 
relocation process.   
 
In support of audit readiness, we are taking actions to improve accountability of mission critical 
assets and to achieve a clean audit in the Department.  We are reviewing notices of findings and 
recommendations received from independent public accounting firms and performing 
assessments of potential valuation methodologies for General Equipment, including weapon 
systems, for consideration as the Department-wide approach for properly valuing them.  This 
will improve the integrity of financial data, which positions the Department to operate more 
efficiently and apply costs savings toward improving lethality. Additionally, we are working 
23 
 
with the audit community and USTRANSCOM on the implementation of an enterprise-level 
transportation management system that will be a significant building block towards auditability. 
      
F-35 Enterprise 
 
The Sustainment organization touches the F-35 enterprises across multiple domains.  F-35 
sustainment continues to be a major focus area of the Department, as we work to increase 
readiness to meet the 80 percent Mission Capable rate goal set as well as reduce F-35 
sustainment cost to align with the Service-budget-informed affordability constraints.  As part of 
the strategy to meet these goals within the FY 2019-2024 time frame, the Department named 
U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) as 
the Global Transportation and Distribution Provider, as well as the Product Support Provider for 
F-35 North American Warehousing.  In this capacity, they will provide wholesale and retail 
warehousing infrastructure and management supporting Air Logistics Complexes and Fleet 
Readiness Centers, along with management of designated commercial warehouses within the 
North American Region. Additionally, DLA and the Services have developed organic supply 
chain initiatives to improve readiness and lower total lifecycle costs.  Further, we issued an 
updated F-35 Life Cycle Sustainment Plan FY 2019 that identified eight success elements 
necessary for the Department to improve readiness and cost to meet warfighter needs.  
 
In FY 2018, the Department accomplished a major acquisition milestones across the F-35 
sustainment enterprise. Our teams improved air vehicle availability by three percent through our 
reliability/maintainability progress, delivered Block 3F Air System, completed Phase 2 Global 
Supply Solution Capability and Capacity (for FYs 2020-2022), reduced DoD ownership costs 
from FY17 actuals, and planned for the Autonomic Logistics Information System re-architecture.  
 
State and Community Engagement – Office of Economic Adjustment 
 
The request for the Office of Economic Adjustment ensures it may continue to support its many 
engagements with states and communities who are key partners to help the Department meet our 
mission. Specific program lines supported by this request include: compatible use engagements 
to lessen the impairments on our local missions brought about by civilian development and 
activity, including energy project siting; industry efforts that promote installation resilience 
through improved understanding of local and regional supply chains’ susceptibility to funding 
fluctuations and cyber attacks; mission growth efforts to plan and deliver the necessary public 
services and infrastructure to support our forces; and, in a few rare circumstances, operational 
support to sustain Local Redevelopment Authorities as they await the disposal of property 
previously excessed through base closure actions.  These funds will also permit the necessary 
oversight and execution of more than $700 million in obligated projects to improve public 
schools on our military installations that support the education of 11,000 military dependents 
annually; nearly $300 million in transportation improvements to improve access to many of our 
premier medical facilities for wounded warriors, their families, and our medical personnel; and, 
close to $180 million in outside the fence investments on Guam for water and waste water 
systems to support our Indo Pacific efforts.  These projects are critical to support quality of life 
issues for our service members and their families.

Conclusion 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to present the President’s FY 2020 budget request for DoD 
programs supporting sustainment.  We appreciate Congress’ continued support for our enterprise 
and look forward to working with you as you consider the budget request.

Secretary Azar Written FY 2020 Budget Testimony 
 
The mission of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to enhance and 
protect the health and well-being of all Americans by providing for effective health and human 
services and by fostering sound, sustained advances in the sciences underlying medicine, public 
health, and social services. This work is organized into five strategic goals, and is unified by a 
vision of our healthcare, human services, and public health systems working better for the 
Americans we serve. By undertaking these efforts in partnerships with states, territories, tribal 
governments, local communities, and the private sector, we will succeed at putting Americans’ 
health first. 
 
Since I testified before this committee in 2018, the HHS team has delivered impressive results. 
This past year saw HHS, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Treasury open up new 
affordable health coverage options, at the same time the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges 
were stabilized, with the national average benchmark premium on HealthCare.gov dropping for 
the first time ever. According to a report by the Council of Economic Advisers, actions taken by 
the Administration, along with the elimination of the individual mandate penalty, are estimated 
to provide a net benefit to Americans of $453 billion over the next decade. 
 
Congress worked with the Administration to deliver new resources for fighting the opioid crisis, 
allowing HHS to make more than $2 billion in opioid-related grants to states, territories, tribes, 
and local communities in 2018. Prescriptions for medication-assisted treatment options and 
naloxone are up, while legal opioid prescribing is down. HHS also worked to bring down 
prescription drug prices, including by setting another record for most generic drug approvals by 
FDA in a fiscal year and working with Congress to ensure pharmacists can inform Americans 
about the lowest-cost prescription drug options.  
 
The President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget supports HHS’s continued work on these 
important goals by prioritizing key investments that help advance the Administration’s 
commitments to improve American health care, address the opioid crisis, lower the cost of drugs, 
and streamline federal programs, while reforming the Department’s programs to better serve the 
American people.   
 
The Budget proposes $87.1 billion in discretionary budget authority and $1.2 trillion in 
mandatory funding for HHS.  It reflects HHS’s commitment to making the federal government 
more efficient and effective by focusing spending in areas with the highest impact. 
 
HHS’s Fiscal Year 2020 Budget reflects decisions not just to be prudent with taxpayer dollars, 
but also to stay within the budget caps Congress created in the Budget Control Act. With the 
largest non-defense discretionary appropriation of any cabinet agency in 2019, HHS must make 
large reductions in spending in order to stay within Congress’s caps, set a prudent fiscal course, 
and provide for other national priorities. This budget demonstrates that HHS can prioritize its 
important work within these constraints, and proposes measures to reform HHS programs while 
putting Americans’ health first.  
 
REFORM, STRENGTHEN, AND MODERNIZE THE NATION’S HEALTH CARE 
SYSTEM 
1 
 
 
Reforming the Individual Market for Insurance 
The Budget proposes bold reforms to empower states and consumers to improve American 
healthcare.  These reforms return the management of health care to the states, which are more 
capable of tailoring programs to their unique markets, increasing options for patients and 
providers, and promoting financial stability and responsibility, while protecting people with pre-
existing conditions and high health care costs.  
 
The Budget includes proposals to make it easier to open and use Health Savings Accounts and 
reform the medical liability system to allow providers to focus on patients instead of lawsuits. 
 
Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs   
Putting America’s health first includes improving access to safe, effective, and affordable 
prescription drugs.  The Budget proposes to expand the Administration’s work to lower 
prescription drug prices and reduce beneficiary out-of-pocket costs.  The Administration has 
proposed and, in many cases, made significant strides to implement bold regulatory reforms to 
increase competition, improve negotiation, create incentives to lower list prices, reduce out-of-
pocket costs, improve transparency, and address foreign free-riding.  Congress has already taken 
bipartisan action to end pharmacy gag clauses, so patients can work with pharmacists to lower 
their out-of-pocket costs.  The Budget proposes to: 
 
  Stop regulatory tactics used by brand manufacturers to impede generic competition; 
  Ensure federal and state programs get their fair share of rebates, and enact penalties to 
prevent the growth of prescription drug prices beyond inflation; 
  Improve the Medicare Part D program to lower seniors’ out-of-pocket costs, create an 
out-of-pocket cap for the first time, and end the incentives that reward list price increases;  
  Improve transparency and accuracy of payments under Medicare Part B, including 
imposing payment penalties to discourage pay-for-delay agreements; and 
  Build on America’s successful generic market with a robust biosimilars agenda, by 
improving the efficient approval of safe and effective biosimilars, ending anti-
competitive practices that delay or restrict biosimilar market entry, and harnessing 
payment and cost-sharing incentives to increase biosimilar adoption. 
 
Reforming Medicare and Medicaid  
Medicare and Medicaid represent important promises made to older and vulnerable Americans, 
promises that President Trump and his administration take seriously. The Budget supports 
reforms to make these programs work better for the people they serve and deliver better value for 
the investments we make.  This includes a plan to modernize Medicare Part D to lower drug 
costs for the Medicare program and for Medicare beneficiaries, as well as proposals to drive 
Medicare toward a value-based payment system that puts patients in control.  The Budget also 
provides additional flexibility to states for their Medicaid program, putting Medicaid on a path to 
fiscal stability by restructuring its financing, reducing waste, and focusing the program on the 
low-income populations Medicaid was originally intended to serve: the elderly, people with 
disabilities, children, and pregnant women.   
 
Paying for Value 
The Administration is focused on ensuring federal health programs produce better care at the 
lowest possible cost for the American people.  We believe that consumers, working with 
2 
 
providers, are in the best position to determine value.  The Budget supports an expansion of 
value-based payments in Medicare with this strategy in mind.  That expansion, along with 
implementation of a package of other reforms, will improve quality, promote competition, 
reduce the federal burden on providers and patients, and focus payments on value instead of 
volume or site of service.  Two of these reforms are: (1) a value-based purchasing program for 
hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgical centers; and (2) a consolidated hospital 
quality program in Medicare to reduce duplicative requirements and create a focus on driving 
improvements in patients’ health outcomes. Advancing value in Medicare along with the other 
reforms in the Budget will extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by eight years, while also 
helping to drive value and innovation throughout America’s entire health system.  Furthermore, 
in December the administration released a report entitled Reforming America’s Healthcare 
System Through Choice and Competition, which contains a series of recommendations to 
improve the health care system by better engaging consumers and unleashing competition across 
providers. 
 
PROTECT THE HEALTH OF AMERICANS WHERE THEY LIVE, LEARN, WORK, 
AND PLAY 
 
Combating the Opioid Crisis 
The Administration has made historic investments to address opioid misuse, abuse, and 
overdose, but significant work must still be done to fully turn the tide of this public health crisis.  
The Budget supports HHS’s five-part strategy to:  
 
  Improve access to prevention, treatment, and recovery services, including the full range 
of medication-assisted treatments;  
  Better target the availability of overdose-reversing drugs;  
  Strengthen our understanding of the crisis through better public health data and reporting;  
  Provide support for cutting edge research on pain and addiction; and  
  Improve pain management practices. 
 
The Budget provides $4.8 billion to combat the opioid overdose epidemic.  The Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) will continue all opioid activities at the 
same funding level as FY 2019, including the successful State Opioid Response Program and 
grants, which had a special focus on increasing access to medication-assisted treatment—the 
gold standard for treating opioid addiction.  At this level, the Budget also provides new funding 
for grants to accredited medical schools and teaching hospitals to develop substance use disorder 
treatment curricula.  
 
In FY 2020, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) will continue to make 
investments to address substance use disorder, including opioid use disorder, through the Rural 
Communities Opioid Response Program, the National Health Service Corps, behavioral health 
workforce programs, and the Health Centers Program.  
 
Medicare and Medicaid policies and funding will also play a critical role in combating the opioid 
crisis.  The Budget proposes allowing states to provide full Medicaid benefits for one-year 
postpartum for pregnant women diagnosed with a substance use disorder.  The Budget also 
proposes to set minimum standards for Drug Utilization Review programs, allowing for better 
oversight of opioid dispensing in Medicaid.  Additionally, it proposes a collaboration between 
3 
 
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Drug Enforcement Administration to stop 
providers from inappropriate opioid prescribing. 
 
The Ending HIV Epidemic Initiative 
 
Recent advances in HIV prevention and treatment create the opportunity to not only control the 
spread of HIV, but to end this epidemic in America.  By accelerating proven public health 
strategies, HHS will aim to reduce new infections by 90 percent within ten years, ending the 
epidemic in America.  The Budget invests $291 million in FY 2020 for the first phase of this 
initiative, which will target areas with the highest infection rates with the goal of reducing the 
number of new diagnoses by 75 percent in five years. 
 
This effort focuses on investing in existing, proven activities and strategies and putting new 
public health resources on the ground.  The initiative includes a new $140 million investment in 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to test and diagnose new cases, rapidly 
link newly infected individuals to treatment, connect at-risk individuals to Pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP), expand HIV surveillance, and directly support states and localities in the 
fight against HIV.    
 
Clients receiving medical care through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) were 
virally suppressed at a record level of 85.9 percent in 2017.  The Budget includes $70 million in 
new funds for RWHAP within HRSA to increase direct health care and support services, further 
increasing viral suppression among patients in the target areas.  The Budget includes $50 million 
in HRSA for expanded PrEP services, outreach, and care coordination in community health 
centers. Additionally, the Budget also prioritizes the reauthorization of RWHAP to ensure 
federal funds are allocated to address the changing landscape of HIV across the United States.   
 
For the Indian Health Service (IHS), the Budget includes $25 million in new funds to screen for 
HIV and prevent and treat Hepatitis C, a significant burden among persons living with 
HIV/AIDS.  The Budget also includes $6 million for the National Institutes of Health’s regional 
Centers for AIDS Research to refine implementation strategies to assure effectiveness of 
prevention and treatment interventions. 
 
In addition to this effort, the Budget funds other activities that address HIV/AIDS including  $54 
million for the Minority HIV/AIDS Fund within the Office of the Secretary and $116 million for 
the Minority AIDS program in SAMHSA.  These funds allow HHS to target funding to minority 
communities and individuals disproportionately impacted by HIV infection. 
 
Prioritizing Biodefense and Preparedness 
The Administration prioritizes the nation’s safety, including its ability to respond to acts of 
bioterrorism, natural disasters, and emerging infectious diseases.  HHS is at the forefront of the 
nation’s defense against public health threats.  The Budget provides approximately $2.7 billion 
to the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund within the Office of the Secretary to 
strengthen HHS’s biodefense and emergency preparedness capacity.  The Budget also proposes a 
new transfer authority that will allow HHS to enhance its ability to respond more quickly to 
public health threats.  Additionally, the Budget supports the government-wide implementation of 
the President’s National Biodefense Strategy. 
 
4 
 
The Budget supports advanced research and development of medical countermeasures against 
chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and infectious disease threats, including pandemic 
influenza.  The Budget also funds late-stage development and procurement of medical 
countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile and emergency public health and medical 
assistance to state and local governments, protecting America against threats such as anthrax, 
botulism, Ebola, and chemical, radiological, and nuclear agents.   
 
STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING OF AMERICANS 
ACROSS THE LIFESPAN 
 
Promoting Upward Mobility 
The Budget promotes independence and personal responsibility, supporting the proven notion 
that work empowers parents and lifts families out of poverty.  To ensure Temporary Assistance 
for Needy Families (TANF) enables participants to work, the Budget includes a proposal to 
ensure states will invest in creating opportunities for low-income families, and to simplify and 
improve the work participation rate states must meet under TANF. The Budget also proposes to 
create Opportunity and Economic Mobility Demonstrations, allowing states to streamline certain 
welfare programs and tailor them to meet the specific needs of their populations. 
 
The Budget supports Medicaid reforms to empower individuals to reach self-sufficiency and 
financial independence, including a proposal to permit states to include asset tests in identifying 
an individual’s economic need, allowing more targeted determinations than are possible with the 
use of a Modified Adjusted Gross Income standard alone.   
 
Improving Outcomes in Child Welfare 
The Budget supports implementation of the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2018 and 
includes policies to further improve child welfare outcomes and prevent child maltreatment.  The 
Budget also expands the Regional Partnership Grants program, which addresses the considerable 
impact of substance use, including opioids use, on child welfare. 
 
Strengthening the Indian Health Service 
Reflecting HHS’s commitment to the health and well-being of American Indians and Alaska 
Natives, the Budget provides $5.9 billion for IHS, which is an additional $392 million above the 
FY 2019 Continuing Resolution.  The increase supports direct health care services across Indian 
Country, including hospitals and health clinics, Purchased/Referred Care, dental health, mental 
health and alcohol and substance abuse services.  The Budget invests in new programs to 
improve patient care, quality, and oversight.  The Budget fully funds staffing for new and 
replacement facilities, new tribes, and Contract Support Costs, ensuring tribes have the necessary 
resources to successfully manage self-governance programs. 
 
FOSTER SOUND, SUSTAINED ADVANCES IN THE SCIENCES 
 
Promoting Research and Prevention 
NIH is the leading biomedical research agency in the world, and its funding supports scientific 
breakthroughs that save lives.  The Budget supports strategic investments in biomedical research 
and activities with significant national impact.   
 
5 
 
NIH launched the Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative in April 2018 to 
advance research on pain and addiction.  Toward this goal, NIH announced funding 
opportunities for the historic HEALing Communities Study, which will select several 
communities to measure the impact of investing in the integration of evidence-based prevention, 
treatment, and recovery across multiple health and justice settings.  The Budget provides $500 
million to continue the HEAL initiative in FY 2020.  
 
The Budget supports a targeted investment in the National Cancer Institute to accelerate pediatric 
cancer research.  Cancer is the leading cause of death from disease among children in the United 
States.  Approximately 16,000 children are diagnosed with cancer in the United States each year. 
While progress in treating some childhood cancers has been made, the science and treatment of 
childhood cancers remains challenging.  Through this initiative, NIH will enhance drug 
discovery, better understand the biology of all pediatric cancers, and create a national data 
resource for pediatric cancer research.  This initiative will develop safer and more effective 
treatments, and provide a path for changing the course of cancer in children.   
 
The new National Institute for Research on Safety and Quality (NIRSQ) proposed in the Budget 
will continue key research activities currently led by the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality.  These activities will support researchers by developing the knowledge, tools, and data 
needed to improve the health care system. 
 
Addressing Emerging Public Health Challenges 
CDC is the nation’s leading public health agency, and the Budget supports its work putting 
science into action.   
 
Approximately 700 women die each year in the United States as a result of pregnancy or delivery 
complications or the aggravation of an unrelated condition by the physiologic effects of 
pregnancy.  Findings from Maternal Mortality Review Committees indicate that more than half 
of these deaths are preventable.  The Budget supports data analysis on maternal deaths and 
efforts to identify prevention opportunities.   
 
The United States must address emerging public health threats, both at home and abroad, to 
protect the health of its citizens.  The Budget invests $10 million to support CDC’s response to 
Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM), a rare but serious condition that affects the nervous system and 
weakens muscles and reflexes.  With this funding, CDC will work closely with national experts, 
healthcare providers, and state and local health departments to thoroughly investigate AFM.   
 
The Budget also provides $100 million for CDC’s global health security activities.  Moving 
forward, CDC will implement a regional hub office model and primarily focus their global health 
security capacity building activities on areas where they have seen the most success: lab and 
diagnostic capacity, surveillance systems, training of disease detectives, and establishing strong 
emergency operation centers.  In addition, CDC will continue on-going efforts to identify health 
emergencies, track dangerous diseases, and rapidly respond to outbreaks and other public health 
threats around the world, including continuing work on Ebola response. 
 
The Budget also strengthens the health security of our nation by continuing CDC’s support to 
state and local government partners in implementing programs, establishing guidelines, and 
conducting research to tackle public health challenges and build preparedness. 
6 
 
 
Innovations in the Food and Drug Administration 
FDA plays a major role in protecting public health by assuring the safety of the nation’s food 
supply and regulating medical products and tobacco.  The Budget provides $6.1 billion for FDA, 
which is an additional $643 million above the FY 2019 Continuing Resolution.  The Budget 
includes resources to promote competition and foster innovation, such as modernizing generic 
drug review and creating a new medical data enterprise.  The Budget advances digital health 
technology to reduce the time and cost of market entry, supports FDA opioid activities at 
international mail facilities to increase inspections of suspicious packages, strengthens the 
outsourcing facility sector to ensure quality compounded drugs, and pilots a pathogen 
inactivation technology to ensure the blood supply continues to be safe.  FDA will continue to 
modernize the food safety system in FY 2020. 
 
PROMOTE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT AND STEWARDSHIP 
 
Almost one quarter of total federal outlays are made by HHS.  The Department employs more 
than 78,000 permanent and temporary employees and administers more grant dollars than all 
other federal agencies combined.  Efficiencies in HHS management have a tremendous impact 
on federal spending as a whole. 
 
Advancing Fiscal Stewardship 
HHS recognizes its immense responsibility to manage taxpayer dollars wisely.  HHS ensures the 
integrity of all its financial transactions by leveraging financial management expertise, 
implementing strong business processes, and effectively managing risk.   
 
In an effort to operate Medicare and Medicaid efficiently and effectively, both to rein in wasteful 
spending and to better serve beneficiaries, HHS is implementing actions such as enhanced 
provider screening, prior authorization, and sophisticated predictive analytics technology, to 
reduce improper payments in Medicare and Medicaid without increasing burden on providers or 
delaying Americans’ access to care or to critical medications.  HHS continues to work with law 
enforcement partners to target fraud and abuse in health care, and the Budget increases 
investment in health care fraud and abuse activities.  The Budget includes a series of proposals to 
strengthen Medicare and Medicaid oversight, including increasing prior authorization,enhancing 
Part D plans’ ability to address fraud, and strengthening the Department’s ability to recoup 
overpayments made to states on behalf of ineligible Medicaid beneficiaries.  
 
Implementing ReImagine HHS 
HHS eagerly took up the call in the Administration’s Government-wide Reform Plan to more 
efficiently and effectively serve the American people.  HHS developed a plan –“ReImagine 
HHS”– organized around a number of initiatives.    
 
ReImagine HHS is identifying a variety of ways to reduce federal spending and improve the 
functioning of HHS’s programs through more efficient operations.  For example, the Buy 
Smarter initiative streamlines HHS’s procurement process by using new and emerging 
technologies. 
 
Conclusion 
 
7 
 
Americans deserve health care, human services, and public health programs that work for them 
and make good use of taxpayer dollars.  The men and women of HHS are committed, innovative, 
hardworking public servants who work each day to improve the lives of all Americans.  
President Trump’s FY 2020 Budget will help advance us toward that goal, accomplish the 
Department’s vital mission, and put Americans’ health first.

81,124 Dirksen Senate Office Building ,https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/04.03.19%20-%20Stenger%20Testimony.pdf,"
Testimony of 
The Honorable Michael C. Stenger 
Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate 
before the 
Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch 
Committee on Appropriations 
United States Senate 
 
April 3, 2019 
Chairman Hyde-Smith, Ranking Member Murphy, distinguished Members of the Subcommittee; 
I appreciate the opportunity to testify in support of the Sergeant at Arms’ budget request for fiscal 
year (FY)20.  
The SAA respectfully requests $214.6 million in appropriated funds; a 1.8% increase from the 
FY19 enacted level. This level of funding supports our continued focus on the safety and security 
of Senators while providing a range of technical and administrative services. Our requested 
increase will allow us to make needed investments in our information technology infrastructure 
and support our 920 full-time equivalents.  
As I begin my second year as Sergeant at Arms, I am pleased to share, with your continued support, 
how we have made steady progress in meeting our mission.  
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS 
We continue to educate, train, and exercise emergency plans and procedures to ensure Members 
and staff are equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills, and tools to prepare for, mitigate, 
respond to, and recover from a variety of emergencies. Using guidelines from the Congressional 
Accountability Act, we worked with Senate offices to update 115 Emergency Action Plans during 
FY18 that provide detailed evacuation routes and elevator locations for the mobility-impaired. 
Further, we assisted 25 offices with drafting their continuity of operations plans strengthening the 
Senate’s ability to continue performing its essential functions during and after disruptive events. 
We also supplied and maintained emergency supply kits, annunciators, and escape hoods, offering 
personalized  preparedness,  alert  notification,  accountability,  and  equipment  training.  We 
distributed guides informing staff on how to respond to threatening situations, protestors, and other 
emergencies. With infants and children now visiting in the Senate Chamber, we added baby escape 
hoods and coordinated with the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) to have infant chest pads included 
with Chamber Automated External Defibrillators.  
Readiness and protection of Members, staff, and visitors remains our primary focus. Working with 
the United States Capitol Police (USCP), we conducted over 30 annual evacuations, shelter in 
place and internal relocation drills, as well as the first offsite Chamber exercise allowing staff to 
observe  and  participate  in  realistic  emergency  scenarios  and  gain  an  appreciation  of  law 
enforcement responses. Further, we trained more than 3,000 staff on essential topics, including 
protective actions, emergency action planning, and ALERTS/Remote Check-In procedures. The 
Responding to an Active Shooter class, which is taught with USCP, remains our most popular 
course on how to react and what to expect from law enforcement. For FY19 and FY20, we plan to 
1 
 
host Preparedness Fairs and invite response organizations during the September recess. This fair 
teaches staff about the services local emergency response organizations provide. Being prepared 
for emergencies at work and at home ensures a resilient work force.  During protests and medical 
emergencies, the SAA uses a Mapping Tool that allows us to view Senate office building 
floorplans, identify room ownership, and gather contact information for impacted offices. We plan 
to expand this tool to create an ‘incident’ view, allowing us to observe data from multiple 
floorplans and buildings over an extended period. We also plan to analyze the Senate Emergency 
Operations Centers (SOCs) to update and standardize capabilities, replacing outdated equipment 
and developing a mobile SOC capability to support emergencies when building access is denied.  
During FY18 and FY19, we expanded the Joint Emergency Mass Notification System (JEMNS) 
to support the Library of Congress (LOC) and Congressional Research Service, and finalized 
unification of the mass notification systems throughout the Capitol complex. For FY20, we plan 
to connect JEMNS with new digital signage throughout Senate buildings. Additionally, we are 
piloting a program with the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to install an alert beacon 
in their hearing room that JEMNS will trigger. This beacon will provide a silent visual notification 
to the Chief Clerk who can determine a response to the emergency message. We are also leading 
the Joint Audible Warning System project to replace the outdated annunciator system and better 
protect life and safety with a target implementation date of FY20. In FY18, we led an effort to 
activate the first Joint Legislative Branch Call Center Plan to handle large call volumes during a 
mass casualty event. Our FY20 budget request includes funds to develop the core services and 
capabilities of a Family Assistance Center.  
We are also finalizing the modernization of an outdated radio system.  These radios rely on a 
system of radio towers and repeaters that we maintain instead of commercial cell tower systems. 
We continue to collaborating with the House, USCP, AOC, and LOC to update, manage, and 
exercise  joint  communications  plans  and  procedures  for  various  additional  communications 
devices.  We are also  working with the executive branch and other partners to continue to 
expand priority and preemption cellular services to select Senate users during highly congested 
events. 
SECURITY PLANNING AND POLICE OPERATIONS 
In coordination with USCP, we provide security and law enforcement support for the Senate 
community. This year’s efforts included: 1) coordinating 1,227 Senate campus access requests; 2) 
working with the Committee on Rules and Administration and USCP to identify and publish 
numerous door and barricade restrictions during recess periods, special events, and holidays; and 
3) representing the Senate on a joint Senate, House, USCP, and AOC campus security-working 
group. Additionally, we coordinated security coverage for 411 committee hearings and more than 
50 Member-specific security requests.   
My office provides real-time situational awareness through USCP Command Center support. Our 
staff are on duty all hours the Senate is in session and throughout normal business hours during 
periods  of  recess  to  allow  for  communications  between  my  office,  USCP,  and  the  Senate 
community throughout routine operations, special events, and emergencies. Approximately 648 
security events, a 74% increase over the previous year, were monitored through this program last 
2 
 
year. My staff also provided security oversight and coverage during the State of the Union address, 
summer concert series, and demonstration activities in Senate office buildings.  
In FY20, we expect an increase in Member specific requests.  My office stands ready to assist 
Member offices with coordinating security and law enforcement needs in either capacity.   
INTELLIGENCE AND PROTECTIVE SERVICES 
We recognize the value of maintaining collaborative partnerships with various federal, state, and 
local law enforcement, intelligence, and force protection entities to synchronize information, 
identify security risks, monitor threat streams, and maintain situational awareness to ensure 
appropriate mitigation and prevention strategies are deployed to protect the safety and security of 
the Senate, domestically and abroad. Expanding social media platforms and the availability of 
open source materials allow individuals to spread malicious intents and activities to a large 
audience. We proactively research and analyze such material and engage with community partners 
and subject matter experts to maintain security-related situational awareness and identify threat 
data against Members, their families, and staff. We discovered approximately 130 comments of 
concern, which we referred to USCP resulting in 24 criminal threat violations, a 33% increase over 
the previous year.  For FY20, we anticipate social media awareness as well as threat discoveries 
to increase as social media platforms become a prominent communication method and open source 
intelligence technology develops further. 
We collaborate with USCP and other law enforcement agencies to ensure appropriate notification 
and communication with specifically targeted Members and staff while continuously monitoring, 
evaluating, and conducting vulnerability, risk, and threat assessments to determine and apply 
suitable  security  measures  and  protective  operations  coverage.  Additionally,  we  provide 
situational awareness for the Senate community regarding significant upcoming events or planned 
activities in and around the Capitol complex and state offices, which may adversely affect Senate 
business. Finally, we collaborate with USCP and other agencies to support contingencies; oversee 
security operations; and perform incident management and response action planning for major 
events including Inauguration, State of the Union, Senatorial retreats, National Conventions, 
televised concerts, joint sessions of Congress, and other high profile National Special Security 
Events  such as the Lying In State or In Honor of a government official in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. 
Key events we will support in FY20 are the Republican and Democratic National Conventions and 
the 2021 Presidential Inauguration. 
OFFICE OF MEMBER OUTREACH AND SECURITY COORDINATION  
We created the Office of Member Outreach and Security Coordination to collaborate with USCP 
and implement several security initiatives, law enforcement outreach efforts, and protective 
services objectives to ensure Members and their staff receive the necessary guidance, tools, and 
support when planning and attending national public events. Weekly emails to Administrative 
Managers, Chief Clerks, and Schedulers offer simple methods for requesting law enforcement 
coordination and security assessments to mitigate concerns at public events with Members in 
attendance. We provide offices with a final product highlighting the overall threat level, specific 
areas of concern, and local law enforcement contact information. This extensive outreach initiative 
3 
 
has led to almost 218 Law Enforcement Coordination and Assessment requests, a 187% increase 
over the previous year, and we anticipate a similar activity level for 2020. 
ID OFFICE 
We partnered with multiple Senate divisions to manage ID badge requests. Almost 12,000 new 
and updated Congressional and Press IDs were issued during FY18. We anticipate our FY20 
volume to be consistent with this requirement. In coordination with the Chief Information Officer, 
we intend to support various capabilities as outlined in the Homeland Security  Presidential 
Directive (HSPD) 12, including email encryption, two-factor authentication, and secure remote 
network access throughout FY19 and FY20. We recently updated our badging software to meet 
National Institute of Science and Technology standards, which are considered best practices, and 
will proceed with upgrading badge production hardware to support the growing demand for Smart 
Cards and proximity-based IDs.  
PARKING OPERATIONS 
Parking  Operations  continues  to  plan  for  staff  vehicle  needs  during  ongoing  renovations 
throughout the Capitol complex. Long-term construction projects such as the Russell Senate Office 
Building’s exterior rehabilitation will continue to affect various permit holders over the next four 
years. In collaboration with the AOC, we remain committed on limiting disruptions during the 
Thurgood Marshall Judiciary Office Building garage renovation. During FY20, we will upgrade 
the permit management application process to streamline enforcement, enhance collection efforts, 
improve accuracy and deliver real-time updates from field Parking Specialists. 
CYBERSECURITY RESPONSE 
We are in the fourth year of transforming cybersecurity from a reactive to proactive program 
defending the Senate. In the FY18 budget, the Appropriations Committee authorized 56 contractor 
to FTE conversions.  As of February 28, 2019, we on boarded 49 FTEs and expect to have all 56 
on board by September 2019. We developed a Cybersecurity Awareness Program to provide real-
time, actionable information to users. This 3-pronged Partnership in Protection approach focuses 
on continued awareness sessions to offices, expanded academic collaboration, and completed 
rollout of a commercial cybersecurity training platform. The result was the completion of 50 
Cybersecurity Awareness sessions to member offices, available to both D.C. and state staff, 
committees and support agencies.  To add, 100% of all Senate staff completed training on 
cybersecurity principles using the commercial training platform and to assess the effectiveness of 
training, we continue to perform phishing tests against users. We will continue providing this 
training throughout FY20 and update it based on adversarial threats.   
In FY20, we intend to develop a methodology to perform advanced resiliency assessments for 
offices.  These assessments—to include coordinated penetration tests, vulnerability assessments 
and advanced phishing assessments—will follow industry and federal guidelines to determine the 
level of cybersecurity risk for Senate offices and provide suggested actions to mitigate risk.

CIO SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS 
We continue to work closely with offices on multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance the 
security of Senate IT infrastructure. With the help of input from Senate offices, we procured an 
MFA solution in November 2018. In FY19, we integrated the MFA solution with our Privileged 
Access Management (PAM) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) solutions and started piloting its 
use with these services in the SAA and with several offices. The pilot will run through May.  
Provided the pilot meets our expectations, we will expand enrollment to all Senate offices, 
completing deployment in FY20.   
To address the ongoing need for increased security of highly privileged accounts, we expanded 
enrollment into PAM to include the accounts used to administer offices’ Constituent Services 
Systems (CSS). PAM significantly increases the security posture of Senate information systems, 
protecting the most sensitive data by limiting exposure of privileged credentials and protecting 
access to those credentials with two-factor authentication. In March, we will begin offering PAM 
pilots to interested Senate Offices; we expect PAM to be a standard offering in FY20. 
The Identity and Access Management (IAM) program will enhance data security by centralizing 
the on-boarding, identity maintenance, access, and de-provisioning of identities requiring access 
to applicable Senate systems. IAM implementation is underway with planned deployment during 
August 2019 through 2020. With the increased adoption of cloud services across the IT landscape, 
this program can extend access and identity governance beyond the local on-premises systems to 
provide the same security to the cloud and support our increasingly mobile workforce. 
ENTERPRISE AND NETWORK SERVICES 
Developing a hybrid cloud strategy remains a key goal during FY19 and FY20. We remain focused 
on a cloud strategy centered on moving appropriate software applications to cloud service after 
careful analysis of data protections. During FY 2020, we will continue to evaluate bandwidth 
available to state offices and upgrade as necessary to support emerging technologies such as 
improved video conferencing capabilities between D.C. and a state office. We will also evaluate 
the feasibility of relocating the Alternate Data Center. Further, we will continue to replace, upgrade 
and modernize our infrastructure and products for some of our core offerings such as Internet 
protocol television, Domain Name Service/Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, and VPN 
services. We have begun offering a full suite of virtualized solutions with the CSS being the most 
recent example. Which includes disaster recovery, enterprise backup and high availability.  
The CIO supports the IT portion of our Continuity of Operations programs through a variety of 
IT-related functions. In September 2018, we awarded a contract and started executing a significant 
radio infrastructure project, permitting the Sergeant at Arms to communicate with multi-agency 
interactions on encrypted equipment during exercises and real-world events. The support includes 
our Mobile Communication Vehicles, network and phone communications for Alternate Chamber 
Operations,  Leadership  Coordination  Centers,  Emergency  Operations  Centers,  and  Briefing 
Centers. We provide secure communication support to Senate offices and committees as required.  
The FY20 budget is postured to maintain this program. 
 
5 
 
ENTERPRISE AND SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT SERVICES 
We continue to support the Secretary of the Senate on implementing a modernized Financial 
Management  Information  System.  Three  new  financial  modules  are  scheduled  for  initial 
implementation this year, with the remainder planned for completion in FY20 and FY21. In an 
effort to modernize the legacy voucher signing application, we worked with the Secretary of the 
Senate to evaluate and deploy a new digital and electronic signature platform. This platform now 
supports the digital signing of Senate purchase card statements and vouchers. For FY19 and FY20, 
we will work with our customers to expand an electronic signature capability, thereby reducing 
manual efforts and streamlining business processes.  
Working with Senate office staff, content providers and our colleagues in the office of the 
Secretary of the Senate, we collaborated to redesign and redevelop Webster, replacing the content 
management system; developing a new, more responsive services directory; and improving the 
user interface to expose valuable information more readily. 
IT SUPPORT COMMUNICATIONS 
In FY18, the SAA began expansion of the digital signage system to approximately 60 locations 
within the Hart, Dirksen and Russell buildings, with 54 new locations added over the next five 
years. The expanded digital signage system will display graphical wayfinding information and 
emergency notifications in addition to existing directory information and hearing schedules.  
The multi-year effort to upgrade and modernize the state office telephony infrastructure for all 
470-plus state offices is underway and the first 50 offices have been completed. We expect to 
complete an additional 145 offices in FY19 and approximately 220 in FY20. It will provide each 
state office with new hardware, increased flexibility, a feature-rich voicemail platform, and 
additional security at a lower cost.  
We are currently evaluating the legacy telephone system for the Capitol and Senate buildings and 
plan to upgrade it, as well as the adjunct systems. This Unified Communications and Collaboration 
(UCC) platform will upgrade existing Voice Over IP telephone switch and associated subsystems, 
including, but not limited to, voice mail, instant messaging, contact center, integrated voice 
response systems, audio/video conferencing, and any other collaboration tools that support Senate 
offices.  We have issued a Request for Proposal for subject matter experts to assist in requirements 
development and design for a new UCC platform and expect responses in mid-April. Our FY20 
budget requests reflects our estimated increase for this upgrade.   
The IT Help Desk addressed approximately 11,000 questions from Senate users annually in D.C. 
and state offices, taking trouble reports and coordinating the activities of the technicians who 
respond to and resolve the problems by phone, online and in person.  In addition, the installation 
team  completed more than 6,600 installation projects over the past twelve months.    Since 
December 2017, we have coordinated the procurement efforts for the recompete to this contract 
scheduled to begin in FY20. Based on lessons learned and user input, we have adjusted the 
deliverables to provide the Senate community with more responsive service from more highly 
trained technicians.  The focus for the new contract includes: introducing more stringent Service 
Level Agreements with the vendor to increase customer satisfaction and adding Service Level 
Objectives to the performance based work statement to better measure success. The FY20 budget 
6 
 
supports  this  planned  improvement,  which  will  assist  Senators  and  staff  in  meeting  their 
responsibilities. 
CONTINGENCY PROGRAMS 
We aim to improve continuity capabilities in the event of relocation, and we manage contingency 
planning efforts, to include the Senate’s ability to operate an Alternate Chamber. Operational plans 
are developed and refined under the direction of the Joint Congressional Continuity Board and 
with the executive branch to sustain a common approach to continuity preparedness. We undertook 
several new classified planning initiatives in FY18, which required comprehensive coordination. 
SAA staff facilitated open and constructive working relationships with critical partners and made 
significant progress on development of capabilities to ensure execution of our essential functions 
with minimal investment. This will ensure constitutional functions continue unimpeded during a 
contingency event.  
Our comprehensive exercise program underwent a transition in FY18, resulting in a program 
focused specifically on continuity. The continuity exercise program conducted over 14 exercises, 
tests, and guided discussions. One example during FY19 included the successful execution of a 
Mobile Capabilities Exercise with joint continuity partners such as the Secretary of the Senate, 
Party Secretaries, House, Architect of the Capitol, Government Publishing Office, and U.S. 
Capitol Police. This was a full-scale exercise conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of emergency 
plans that govern activities during a contingency event impacting the Senate Chamber. Exercise 
planners provided an objective, independent analysis of our programs and assisted in the validation 
and improvement of actionable plans by identifying strengths, improvement areas, and lessons 
learned. This approach continues to ensure we meet program goals in a manner that benefits all 
Senate and partner organizations. In FY20, continuity staff anticipate exercising multiple classified 
programs as well as an exercise of the Senate Alternate Chamber in SH-216. This full-scale 
exercise will test the ability of the Senate to set up and operate an alternate Senate Chamber and 
select support offices in SH-216. Major components of this exercise will include an examination 
of  the  U.S.  Senate  Alternate  Chamber  Plan  and  the  establishment  of  Chamber  equipment, 
furnishings, broadcast, and connectivity to the Senate network.     
PRINTING, GRAPHICS AND DIRECT MAIL  
We provide support to the Senate community through graphic design, printing, photocopying, 
mailing, document preservation, logistics, and secure offsite transfer of Senate material. As good 
stewards of fiscal resources, we reduced equipment maintenance costs by approximately $125,000 
through contract negotiation, saving more than $1,200,000 by locally producing charts for Senate 
floor proceedings and committee hearings, and reducing postage by more than $1,000,000 by pre-
sorting and discounting 4.5 million pieces of outgoing Senate franked mail. 
We continue to refresh and expand our hardware, software, and production equipment to maintain 
and enhance the products and services rendered to the Senate community. Through software 
updates  and  enhanced  training,  we  will  continue  to  provide  more  integral  communication 
opportunities by using digital technology to create both print and digital solutions for Senate 
offices throughout FY19 and into FY20. We also expanded our graphic design consultation 
service, first offered to the Senate community in FY18. Our talented graphic designers are 
7 
 
available to provide creative and technical expertise, and have held over 170 consultations since 
inception in January 2018. Our FY20 budget request will allow us to provide a similar level of 
support as well as upgrade existing infrastructure by replacing outdated lighting in the portrait 
studio and continue to monitor technological advances in image capture and production, with a 
specific focus on silent cameras.  
SENATE POST OFFICE 
We test and deliver mail and packages to more than 180 locations within the Capitol complex, 
while providing a messenger service to multiple locations throughout the Washington metropolitan 
area. In FY18, our office safely processed and delivered more than 8.7 million incoming mail items 
while intercepting 156 suspicious mailings that required an immediate response by the USCP. We 
prevented delivery of an additional 720 mailings bearing characteristics with the intent to disrupt 
Senate business and requiring further scrutiny by USCP.  
Our office began replacing older Postal Sentry mail-screening workstations with the smaller Sentry 
Air System workstations in 2016. In FY20 we intend to purchase additional mail screening 
workstations to ensure availability of the most current equipment for all state staff. Providing mail 
safety and security training for both D.C. and state offices remains vital to ensuring all Senate staff 
know how to respond to potentially dangerous situations.  We offer the training through the web 
(static video), VTC, and webinars and accomplish it in coordination with our State Office 
Programs Group.   
CAPITOL FACILITIES  
We support the work of the Senate by providing a clean, professional environment in the Capitol. 
Our Environmental Services Division cleans Capitol offices, hallways, and restrooms; moves 
furniture for offices; and provides special event setups for 15 meeting rooms in the Capitol and the 
Senate  expansion  space  in  the  Capitol  Visitor  Center.  The  Furnishings  Division  provides 
furnishings, including stock and custom furniture, carpeting, and window treatments, to Capitol 
offices. They also provide framing services for Senate offices and committees. Their focus 
continues on realizing cost savings and improved efficiency, while maintaining the same level of 
service. Capitol Facilities ensures the highest level of service while the Senate is in session and 
has established standard operating procedures. Throughout FY19 and into FY20, we will focus on 
improving equipment to maximize safety and efficiency, and undergo upgrades to the online work 
order system that notifies staff of new work orders and tracks workloads.  
SUPPORT SERVICES 
Transportation and Fleet Operations 
We procure, manage, and maintain Senate vehicles; operate the Senate Daily Shuttle service; and 
provide the Senate with emergency transportation and logistics support. The fleet includes trucks, 
vans, buses, SUVs, electric vehicles, handicapped-accessible vehicles, and Segways. In FY18, 
staff transported more than 21,000 passengers through the SAA Shuttle Service and our FY19 
budget and FY20 request have us postured to provide the same level of support.   
 
8 
 
Photography Studio 
We provide photo-imaging services for Senate offices and committees. Our studio manages and 
maintains the Photo Browser application that provides Senate offices a secure, accessible archive 
to all photos accumulated during a Senator’s term in office. Currently, the Photo Browser system 
contains more than 1.5 million photo image files. In FY18, our staff photographed more than 
110,000 images, produced more than 59,000 photo prints, and coordinated scanning for end of 
term archiving of more than 89,000 photo images for Senators leaving office.  We are able to 
provide the same level of service in FY20 as we did in FY19 without any additional increase.    
STATE OFFICE OPERATIONS 
We established State Office Operations in FY18 to consolidate and streamline state office 
support functions. We execute all leasing, tenant improvement, project management, security, 
and emergency preparedness functions for over 470 federal, commercial, and mobile Senate state 
offices across the United States. Our staff works closely with commercial landlords, the General 
Services Administration, and the Federal Protective Service to ensure Members’ operational and 
security needs are met in their state offices. In 2018, we completed 87 relocation and renovation 
projects, coordinating construction, furniture, equipment, and delivery of IT services.  We expect 
this number to double in 2019, as the team works to support new Members and all commercial 
lease renewals for the 116th Congress. In FY20, our state office support will continue, focusing 
mainly on moving new Members into permanent space and supporting off-cycle renovations.   
 
We remain committed to ensuring the safety of Members and staff, and continue to provide 
customized security systems, monitoring services, and enhanced office security construction 
designs to state offices without affecting Member office budgets. In 2018, we provided physical 
security enhancements to 24 new state offices, as well as enhanced security in 31 existing 
offices.  Throughout FY20, those numbers are expected to increase as we move new Members 
into permanent state offices and outfit each location with our recommended suite of security 
enhancements.   
 
Emergency preparedness training and familiarity with security equipment equates to higher levels 
of compliance and readiness. In 2018, we trained more than 100 Office Emergency Coordinators, 
staff, and interns through 26 webinars, and provided security awareness briefings and active 
shooter training to 142 staff members at state offices. Our focus on readiness and training will 
continue through 2020.  We have worked closely with U.S. Capitol Police to update our security 
awareness and emergency preparedness curriculum and have planned for a 100% increase in the 
travel in order to provide on-site training in state offices.  We will also continue supporting the 
requirement for state offices to comply with the Congressional Accountability Act: assisting them 
with the development of recommended emergency action and continuity of operations plans.   
SENATE RECORDING STUDIO 
In 2018, we provided  1,536 hours of gavel-to-gavel  coverage of Senate floor proceedings, 
including  live  streaming  and  archiving  of  the  proceedings  on  the  Senate’s  website, 
www.senate.gov. We also coordinate with other government agencies, such as the Voice of 
America and the Department of State, to provide hearings to a larger audience. Further, we enable 
9 
 
Senators working in D.C. to communicate with their constituents and news outlets back home. In 
2018, the Studio produced 1,635 television productions, an increase of over 57% from the previous 
year, and 1,088 radio productions. Throughout FY19 and into FY20, we have been systematically 
replacing the technical plant within the Recording Studio.  Moreover, we are establishing a 30-
year planning and programming document that will meet the audio/visual replacement needs for 
committee hearing rooms as well as other key meeting rooms within the Capitol complex.  
PERIODICAL PRESS GALLERY 
The Senate Periodical Press Gallery serves the needs of accredited news reporters for magazines, 
newsletters, non-daily newspapers and online publications. Serving as a liaison between reporters, 
Senate officials, and law enforcement remains our primary responsibility. Media presence on 
Capitol Hill has increased dramatically over the past few years. Our staff helps maintain crowd 
control in the Senate subway and the Ohio Clock Corridor during votes and party caucus meetings. 
We also coordinate press coverage of hearings, news conferences, stakeouts, and other media 
events in the Capitol and Senate office buildings. In addition, we review new press applications in 
consultation with the Executive Committee of Periodical Correspondents; renew approximately 
1,000 press credentials each year; and maintain daily Senate floor logs on the Senate Periodical 
Press Gallery website (www.periodicalpress.senate.gov), which tracks legislative activity, votes, 
and schedule updates. Reporters and Senate staff are also kept informed about Senate legislative 
activity on the Gallery’s Twitter account (@Senate PPG), which grew over 20% in 2018 to 8,900 
followers. Our 2020 budget request will allow us to continue providing the same level of service. 
DAILY PRESS GALLERY  
We issue approximately 1,600 credentials to journalists each year. As custodians of the largest 
press complex on Capitol Hill, we serve more than 100 reporters who work in the Press Gallery 
on a regular basis. Further, we control access to the Press Gallery inside the Senate Chamber, 
ensure gallery rules are followed, and coordinate with Senate committees on press coverage for 
hearings and other events around Capitol Hill. Our staff remains focused on modernizing services, 
streamlining the online credentialing process, and maintaining real time website updates on Senate 
floor  proceedings  and  notifications  to  Senate  staff  and  reporters  via  email  and  Twitter 
(@SenatePress). 
PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS GALLERY  
Our 2020 budget request allows us to continue to provide support to press photographers and 
representing news organizations from across the United States and around the world serves as our 
primary duty to ensuring a liaison between news photographers and Congress. Since the House of 
Representatives does not have their own press Photographers Gallery, our staff supports the press 
photographers and Congressional staff at House news events and hearings. We support press 
logistics at many high profile hearings and events and coordinate with other SAA offices, the U.S. 
Capitol Police, and Senate and House offices to ensure press photographers have access without 
interfering with the duties of the Congress. Equally important is our coordination of the press 
logistic plans for continuity of government. 
 
10 
 
RADIO AND TELEVISION GALLERY 
Our staff serves as the Senate’s primary contact to the broadcast news, ensuring the Senate’s 
broadcast coverage rules are followed. We function as liaison between Senate offices and the 
broadcast media. We issue approximately 3,500 credentials each year to television and radio 
reporters,  producers,  and  technical  personnel.  We  also  maintain  the  studio  and  technical 
infrastructure Senators use for news conferences. In an effort to ensure live coverage capability, 
our staff conducts an extensive connectivity maintenance program, to include the fiber optic 
cabling throughout the Senate office buildings. 
SENATE DOORKEEPERS 
As Doorkeepers, we provide access to those with Senate floor privileges; enforce the rules of the 
Senate floor; and facilitate the needs of Senators, Senate floor staff, and Senate Pages. We provide 
support for a number of special events attended by Senators, their families, and special guests. 
Moreover, we process approximately 200,000 visitors from around the world each year and ensure 
they can visit the Senate Galleries safely. In keeping with safety, we also undertake emergency 
preparedness roles balancing access and safety in the Senate.  
SENATE APPOINTMENT DESK 
At the Senate Appointment Desk, we safely and efficiently process thousands of Senate guests 
each year for business meetings or other purposes. During FY18, we processed approximately 
230,000 visitors through our network of Appointment Desks located on the first floor of the 
Capitol, in the basements of the Russell and Hart Senate office buildings, and in the Capitol Visitor 
Center. Of these, more than 108,000 visitors were in the Capitol complex for official business or 
for a meeting with a Member, a Member’s office, or a committee. In addition, more than 29,000 
international  visitors  relied  on  the  CVC  Appointment  Desk  for  Senate  Gallery  Passes  and 
information. 
HUMAN RESOURCES 
Our office provides personnel services and advice to SAA managers and employees. In addition, 
we provide workers’ compensation, ergonomic assessments, Americans with Disabilities Act 
accommodation requests, and recruitment services to the broader Senate community. During 
FY18, the Senate Placement Office received 631 requests for recruitment assistance from Senate 
offices and processed 28,505 resumes from applicants seeking Senate employment. 
Our FY20 budget justification requests a small increase to support the transit subsidy program for 
our employees.  Further, throughout FY19 and FY20, we remain committed to work in concert 
with  the  Secretary  of  the  Senate  to  streamline  our  human  resource  efforts  to  leverage  the 
efficiencies offered by improvements to the HR information system.     
JOINT OFFICE FOR TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT 
As the Joint Office for Training and Development, we provide training to all Senate staff so they 
have the resources and skills needed to perform their jobs. We average about 3,000 attendees for 
in-person classes and over 1,500 attendees for online courses annually. We facilitate conferences 
for state office staff, and provide customized training, facilitation services, and coaching to 
11 
 
Member, committee, and support offices averaging, about 1,800 attendees each year. During 
FY19, we will upgrade our online training and webinar software, validate the skills needed by 
Member and committee office staff, and continue to increase the library of online lessons created 
in-house.  
The mandated Health Promotion section provides health promotion activities and events for the 
Senate community. Each year, this section coordinates and hosts the two-day Wellness Fair, which 
averages about 2,000 participants in health promotion activities, including screenings for glucose, 
cholesterol,  and blood  pressure;  exercise demonstrations; and seminars on topics, including 
healthy eating and cancer prevention. As of FY18, we coordinated with the American College of 
Surgeons and the Stop the Bleed Coalition to provide bleeding control training for D.C. Senate 
staff. This lifesaving training started in FY18 and will continue quarterly.  Our FY20 budget 
postures us to continue providing needed education and training for the entire Senate.  
EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
Our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) offers a variety of emotional, behavioral and work-
related support resources and services to staff, their family members, Senate Pages, and interns. In 
2018, nearly 1 in 13 Senate employees used the services of an EAP counselor - an increase of 15% 
over the previous year and a 52% increase in hours spent in direct service to Senate Staff.  Further, 
245 employees took an online mental health screening, 45 managers requested a supervisory 
consultation; 2,355 employees attended an EAP training activity; and 1,951 employees accessed 
resources for personalized information and referrals addressing childcare, parenting, adult care, 
aging, education, legal concerns, and/or financial issues.  Because of the increase in Senate use of 
the EAP, we moved one FTE from another source during FY19 to ensure the EAP was staffed to 
best support the Senate.  We believe the FY20 budget and FTE count will continue to provide the 
same high level of support to the Senate.  
CONCLUSION 
I want to thank you for your bipartisan support to the SAA.  The FY20 Sergeant at Arms’ budget 
request provides sufficient funding to maintain a focus on continual improvements to the security 
and support of the institution while remaining good stewards of taxpayer dollars.   We will work 
closely with you to ensure we meet your needs in a timely and efficient manner.

 Testimony Statement of  
The Honorable Lisa E. Gordon-Hagerty 
Under Secretary for Nuclear Security 
and Administrator of the 
National Nuclear Security Administration 
U.S. Department of Energy 
Before the  
Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development 
Senate Committee on Appropriations 
 
April 3, 2019 
 
Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you 
for the opportunity to present the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 budget request for the 
Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  NNSA 
appreciates the Committee’s strong support for our nuclear security mission and for the 
workforce and organizations that are responsible for executing it every day.  
NNSA’s enduring missions are to protect our Nation by maintaining a safe, secure, and effective 
nuclear weapons stockpile, reducing global nuclear threats, and providing the United States 
(U.S.) Navy’s submarines and aircraft carriers with militarily effective nuclear propulsion.  
NNSA has numerous strategic partners that enable, contribute to, and benefit from our efforts, 
yet no other government or civilian organization can accomplish our unique mission on behalf of 
the American people. 
The U.S. nuclear deterrent has been the cornerstone of our national security and global stability 
for more than 70 years, and its credibility serves as the ultimate insurance policy against a 
nuclear attack.  While the ultimate goal of eliminating nuclear weapons has been an aspiration 
for generations, we must recognize the reality that foreign nuclear threats are growing.  It is 
imperative that we modernize the U.S. nuclear deterrent and enterprise; our credibility assures 
our friends and allies and deters those who wish us harm. 
Thanks to continued strong support from this Administration and Congress, NNSA is 
transforming the nuclear security enterprise to be more responsive and resilient.  The following 
highlights:  (1) NNSA’s accomplishments in calendar year 2018; (2) the budget request for 
NNSA; (3) Weapons Activities Appropriation; (4) Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Appropriation; (5) Naval Reactors Appropriation; and (6) NNSA Federal Salaries and Expenses 
Appropriation. 
NNSA’s Accomplishments in Calendar Year 2018 
Plutonium Pit Production:  The highest NNSA infrastructure priority is re-establishing a 
plutonium pit production and fabrication capability to meet the Department of Defense’s (DoD) 
military requirements.  Our national requirement, supported by numerous studies and analyses, 
requires no fewer than 80 war-reserve pits per year by 2030.  Last May, the Nuclear Weapons 
Council (NWC) endorsed NNSA’s recommended alternative calling for plutonium pit production 
1 
 
 
at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the Savannah River Site (SRS).  This two-site 
approach bolsters the nuclear security enterprise’s responsiveness and resiliency. 
NNSA’s Life Extension Programs (LEPs), Modifications, and Alteration:  In January 2019, 
NNSA completed the program of record for the W76-1 LEP, extending the warhead’s service 
life from 20 years to 60 years.  The B61-12 LEP, W80-4 LEP, W88 Alteration 370, W87-1 
Modification, and the W76-2 Modification continue to remain on budget and schedule.  These 
achievements are a testament to NNSA’s ability to deliver on our commitments we have made to 
DoD and Congress.   
Infrastructure Investments:  NNSA commenced construction of the main buildings of the 
Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) at the Y-12 National Security Complex (Y-12). UPF remains 
on budget and on schedule for delivery by the end of 2025 for no more than $6.5 billion. NNSA 
also broke ground on the new Albuquerque Complex, which will house 1,200 employees when 
complete.   
 
Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU):  Working with the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), China, and Nigeria, NNSA was instrumental in the conversion of a Nigerian research 
reactor from HEU to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel.  This marks NNSA’s 74th research 
reactor or isotope production facility conversion, which was followed by repatriation of the HEU 
fuel to China, making Nigeria the 33rd country plus Taiwan to become HEU free.   
 
Nuclear Material Removal:  NNSA removed or confirmed disposition of more than 280 
kilograms of HEU from four countries, enough material for more than 11 nuclear weapons.   
 
Counterterrorism:  NNSA’s technical experts were deployed to numerous widely attended public 
events such as the Super Bowl and the Boston Marathon to provide radiation detection, 
identification, and technical advice, helping to protect the public from acts of nuclear and 
radiological terrorism.  This level of support requires NNSA’s response assets to maintain full 
operational readiness at all times. 
 
Naval Nuclear Propulsion:  NNSA’s Office of Naval Reactors continued its record of safe and 
reliable nuclear propulsion and nuclear fleet support, while contributing expertise to the U.S. 
Navy’s new Columbia-Class program.  This next generation nuclear-powered submarine will 
ensure required sea-based deterrence capabilities for decades to come. 
 
Supercomputing:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) unveiled the Sierra 
supercomputer, ranked the second-fastest in the world according to the Top 500 list.  
 
For more than 70 years, from the early days of the Manhattan Project to the height of the Cold 
War, the dedicated men and women of the nuclear security enterprise have overcome every 
obstacle in their way, all while accomplishing a complex and enduring national security mission.  
With Congress’ continued support, NNSA will similarly overcome the nuclear security threats 
that face us today and into the future.

NNSA’s FY 2020 Budget Request 
The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (2018 NPR) calls for the United States to have modern, 
flexible, and resilient nuclear capabilities that are safe and secure until such a time as nuclear 
weapons can prudently be eliminated from the world.  All previous NPRs highlighted the need to 
maintain a modern nuclear weapons infrastructure, yet the United States has fallen behind in 
sustaining a modern infrastructure that is resilient and has the capacity to respond to unforeseen 
threats.  Additionally, the 2018 NPR reiterates the United States’ commitment to effective 
nonproliferation and arms control measures, both of which are equally important as having a 
credible deterrent. 
 
For the Nation to retain a credible deterrent and prevent, counter, and respond to global nuclear 
security threats, NNSA will require significant and sustained investments in its nuclear security 
mission.  In pursuit of these goals, the President’s FY 2020 budget request for NNSA is $16.5 
billion.  This is an increase of $1.3 billion, or 8.3 percent, over the FY 2019 enacted level.1   
 
Weapons Activities Appropriation 
 
The FY 2020 budget request for the Weapons Activities account is $12.4 billion, an increase of 
$1.3 billion, or 12 percent, over FY 2019 request levels.  The programs funded in this account 
support the Nation’s current and future defense posture and the associated nationwide 
infrastructure of science, technology, engineering, cybersecurity, and production capabilities.   
 
The majority of weapons in today’s stockpile have surpassed their intended design life, thereby 
accumulating increasing risk.  The United States has reduced its stockpile by 25 percent since 
2010, while potential adversaries have increased their numbers of nuclear weapons and 
significantly modernized their nuclear capabilities.   
 
Maintaining the Stockpile 
 
In FY 2019, the science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program supported certifying to the 
President for the 23rd consecutive year that the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile remains safe, 
secure, and reliable without the need for nuclear explosive testing.  This remarkable scientific 
achievement is made possible through the work accomplished by NNSA’s world-class scientists, 
engineers, and technicians, and through investments in state-of-the-art diagnostic tools, high 
performance computing platforms, and modern facilities.  
 
For Directed Stockpile Work (DSW), the FY 2020 budget request is $5.4 billion, an increase of 
$768 million, or 16.5 percent, over the FY 2019 enacted level.  Included within this request is 
funding to support the LEPs, modifications, and a major alteration.  These modernization efforts 
are aligned with the needs outlined in the 2018 NPR and approved by the NWC. 
 
W76-1 LEP:  The W76-1 LEP, which directly supports the sea-based leg of the nuclear triad, 
completed its production run in December 2018.  Close-out activities in FY 2020 include 
                                                           
1 Amounts do not reflect the transfer of funds from Naval Reactors to the Office of Nuclear Energy for maintenance 
and operation of the Advanced Test Reactor in FY 2019. 
3 
 
 
archiving production tooling and program records, and completing component overbuilds to 
support hardware provisioning for the life of the warhead system.  
 
W76-2 Modification Program:  The W76-2 is currently on schedule and on budget.  The First 
Production Unit (FPU) was completed in February 2019.  By providing the U.S. an assured 
ability to respond in kind to a low-yield nuclear attack, the W76-2 discourages an adversary from 
pursuing such an attack and therefore strengthens deterrence. Having credible response options 
to a nuclear attack of any magnitude ensures no adversary mistakenly believes the U.S. would be 
deterred from responding to a low-level nuclear attack for fear of escalation. 
 
B61-12 LEP:  The B61-12 LEP will consolidate four variants of the B61 gravity bomb and 
improve the safety and security of the weapon.  Currently in Phase 6.4, Production Engineering, 
this LEP has demonstrated system performance in over 60 integrated ground and flight tests, 
including eight joint flight test drops.  The B61-12 LEP will enter Phase 6.5, First Production, in 
the fourth quarter of FY 2019, following completion of system qualification and Pantex Plant 
production readiness activities. 
 
W88 Alteration 370:  The FPU is on track for completion by December 2019.  This program, 
which also supports the sea-based leg of the nuclear triad, is currently in Phase 6.4, Production 
Engineering, and will enter Phase 6.5, First Production, in September 2019.   
 
W80-4 LEP:  In February 2019, the NWC approved the W80-4 LEP to transition into Phase 6.3, 
Development Engineering.  The FY 2020 request for $899 million will allow the W80-4 LEP to 
remain on track to achieve FPU completion in FY 2025 in support of the Air Force’s Long-
Range Stand-Off (LRSO) cruise missile. 
 
W87-1 Modification Program:  The W87-1 program will replace the aging W78 warhead, with 
planned first production in 2030 to support fielding on the U.S. Air Force’s Ground Based 
Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) missile system.  In September 2018, the NWC authorized restart of 
Phase 6.2, Program Feasibility Study, activities on the W78 replacement warhead and renamed it 
the W87-1.  The W87-1 Modification Program will improve the warhead’s safety and security, 
addressing design, material obsolescence, performance, and survivability considerations.   
 
Within DSW, the FY 2020 budget request includes $636 million for Stockpile Systems, an 
increase of $36 million, or 6.1 percent above the FY 2019 enacted level.  This program sustains 
the stockpile in accordance with the Nuclear Weapon Stockpile Plan by producing and replacing 
limited-life components such as neutron generators and gas transfer systems; conducting 
maintenance, surveillance, and evaluations to assess weapon reliability; detecting and 
anticipating potential weapon issues; and compiling and analyzing information during the annual 
assessment process.   
 
The DSW request also includes $1.1 billion for Stockpile Services, an increase of $76 million, or 
7.2 percent, above the FY 2019 enacted level, to support the modernization of capabilities to 
improve efficiency of manufacturing operations to meet future requirements.  This request 
supports all DSW operations by funding programmatic and infrastructure management, and 
4 
 
 
maintaining the core competencies and technologies essential for reliable and operable 
stewardship capabilities.   
  
The FY 2020 budget for Strategic Materials is necessary to maintain NNSA’s ability to produce 
nuclear and other strategic materials associated with its weapons programs, as well as refurbish 
and manufacture components made from these materials.  This includes uranium, plutonium, 
tritium, and lithium.   
 
Strategic Materials Sustainment:  The request of $257 million, an increase of $41 million, or 18.8 
percent, above the FY 2019 enacted level, will develop and implement strategies to maintain the 
technical base for strategic materials in support of NNSA’s nuclear weapons, nonproliferation, 
and naval nuclear propulsion activities at NNSA’s eight sites.   
 
Uranium Program:  The FY 2020 budget request of $909 million for the Uranium Program is 
comprised of Uranium Sustainment ($94 million), Process Technology Development ($70 
million), and the UPF project ($745 million).2  Uranium Sustainment supports the program to 
maintain existing enriched uranium capabilities through enhanced equipment maintenance while 
preparing to phase out mission dependency on Building 9212, a Manhattan Project-era 
production facility at Y-12.  The funding request will enable NNSA to sustain uranium 
manufacturing capabilities while accelerating planning and execution of the Building 9212 exit 
strategy to reduce risks associated with transitioning enriched uranium capabilities to the UPF.  
Process Technology Development supports key capability transitions out of Building 9212, 
including chip processing, purified metal production, and recovery of low equity material, into 
enduring nuclear facilities.  Funding for UPF will support peak construction activities in FY 
2020 and FY 2021.  UPF will provide uranium casting, special oxide production, and salvage 
and accountability capabilities for the enterprise.   
 
Plutonium Sustainment:  The FY 2020 budget request of $712 million, an increase of $351 
million, or 97.2 percent, above the FY 2019 enacted level, supports continued progress to meet 
pit production requirements.  The requested funding would support efforts to begin the long-term 
plan to develop a capability to produce no fewer than 80 war-reserve pits per year by 2030, as 
directed in the 2018 NPR.   
 
The time to move forward is now.  Repurposing the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication 
Facility and producing plutonium pits at SRS and LANL is the preferred path to achieve the 
critical DoD requirement of 80 pits per year by 2030.  Even though this approach will require 
NNSA to fund activities at two sites, any interruption or delay to pit production in the future due 
to the lack of resiliency will have huge cost increases across the entire nuclear security 
enterprise.  NNSA is investing in the Savannah River Plutonium Processing Facility.  The 
agency is executing conceptual design activities for the repurposed MOX Fuel Fabrication 
Facility and moving forward with National Environmental Policy Act activities.   
 
NNSA is also investing at LANL to provide all the tools necessary for the enterprise to 
successfully support an enduring plutonium pit production mission to produce 30 pits per year by 
                                                           
2 Process Technology Development is funded under the Advanced Manufacturing Development program, and the 
UPF project is funded under Infrastructure and Operations. 
5 
 
 
2026.  NNSA anticipates $3 billion in total funding over the next five years to enable this, and 
LANL is actively installing pit production equipment and has begun hiring to meet future work 
scope.  As the Nation’s plutonium center of excellence for research and development, LANL 
plays a critical role in early design efforts for pit production.   
 
In addition, NNSA’s budget request includes funding for the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research 
Replacement project at LANL, which supports our plan to cease operations in buildings dating 
back to the Manhattan Project, in the height of the Cold War, and transition to modern facilities.   
 
Tritium Program:  The FY 2020 budget request of $269 million, a decrease of $21 million, or 7.3 
percent, below the FY 2019 enacted level, will provide the tritium necessary for national security 
requirements.  Tritium must be replenished regularly because it radioactively decays at 5.5 
percent per year.  Tritium availability is dependent on both the production of new tritium and the 
recovery and recycling of tritium from returned warhead components.  Mission requirements 
necessitate that tritium production double by the mid-2020s.  NNSA’s tritium strategy focuses on 
increasing tritium production in Tennessee Valley Authority reactors and modernizing 
infrastructure at SRS to support the tritium supply chain.   
 
Lithium Program:  The FY 2020 budget request of $29 million, a decrease of $335,000, or 1.1 
percent below the FY 2019 enacted level, supports a lithium bridging strategy to maintain the 
production of lithium.  The FY 2020 budget request includes $32 million for the Lithium 
Processing Facility (LPF), which will replace 1940s infrastructure at Y-12 and house lithium 
processing capabilities by 2030.  NNSA completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for the 
LPF and is preparing for Critical Decision 1, establishing the preferred alternative design and 
estimated budget.   
 
Domestic Uranium Enrichment (DUE):  The FY 2020 budget request of $140 million, an 
increase of $90 million, or 180 percent above the FY 2019 enacted level, will continue efforts to 
make available, when needed, the necessary supplies of enriched uranium for a variety of 
national security needs.  The DUE program schedule is driven by the nearest-term defense 
need—unobligated low enriched uranium for tritium production. Other Departmental needs for 
enriched uranium (e.g., research reactors, naval fuel) are supported by this effort as well.   
 
For Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E), the FY 2020 budget request is $2.3 
billion, an increase of $264 million, or 13.1 percent above the FY 2019 enacted levels.   
 
Increases to the Science Program ($587 million) provide additional funding to support 
subcritical experiments for pit reuse and advanced diagnostics for subcritical hydrodynamic 
integrated weapons experiments that produce data for stockpile certifications.   
 
The Engineering Program ($234 million) sustains NNSA’s capability for creating and maturing 
advanced toolsets and technologies to improve weapon surety and support annual stockpile 
assessments.   
 
In FY 2020, the Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Program ($481 million) 
will continue to maintain essential experimental capabilities and expertise in high energy density 
6 
 
 
stockpile science.  These efforts continue to provide data to reduce uncertainty in calculations of 
nuclear weapons performance and improve the predictive capability of science and engineering 
models in high-pressure, high-energy, high-density regimes.   
 
The FY 2020 request includes $840 million for the Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) 
Program, which continues NNSA’s close collaboration with DOE’s Office of Science to 
implement the Exascale Computing Initiative.  The ASC Program supports stockpile stewardship 
by developing and delivering predictive simulation capabilities for nuclear weapons systems in 
addition to deploying increasingly more powerful supercomputers at Sandia, Los Alamos, and 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.   
 
The Secure Transportation Asset (STA) program provides safe, secure movement of nuclear 
weapons, special nuclear material, and weapon components to meet projected DOE, DoD, and 
other customer requirements.  The Office of Secure Transportation has an elite security 
workforce that performs sensitive and demanding work; our agents are among the most highly 
trained and dedicated national security personnel operating within the United States.  The FY 
2020 budget request is $317 million, of which $80 million continues our efforts to modernize 
and replace the existing fleet of transporters with the Mobile Guardian Transporter (MGT).  The 
MGT will be used for the containment and transport of nuclear weapons, weapons components, 
and/or special nuclear materials.   
 
Improving Safety, Operations, and Infrastructure 
 
An effective, responsive, and resilient nuclear weapons infrastructure is essential to the U.S. 
capacity to adapt flexibly to shifting requirements.  Such an infrastructure offers tangible 
evidence to both allies and potential adversaries of U.S. nuclear weapons capabilities and can 
help to deter, assure, hedge against adverse developments, and discourage adversary interest in 
arms competition.   
 
More than half of NNSA’s facilities are over 40 years old, and roughly 30 percent date back to 
the Manhattan Project.  It will take sustained, significant resources to modernize NNSA’s 
nuclear weapons infrastructure.   
 
Thanks to the support of the Administration and Congress, NNSA is making progress in 
repairing, replacing, and modernizing NNSA’s facilities and stabilizing deferred maintenance; 
yet much more remains to be done.  The FY 2020 budget request for Infrastructure and 
Operations is $3.2 billion, an increase of $121 million, or 3.9 percent above the FY 2019 enacted 
level.  It includes $1.1 billion for line item construction and over $580 million for minor 
construction and equipment recapitalization needs.  Delivering these projects on budget and 
schedule is contingent upon stable and predictable funding profiles, and support for the 
President’s budget request.  
 
Many of NNSA’s excess process-contaminated facilities will ultimately be transferred to DOE’s 
Office of Environmental Management (EM) for disposition.  For example, EM commenced 
efforts to remove Building 280 Pool Type Reactor and ancillary facilities at Lawrence Livermore 
7 
 
 
National Laboratory.  NNSA identified five (including Building 280) of the top ten highest risk 
excess facilities at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
In the interim, NNSA is focusing on reducing risks where possible.  NNSA has made critical 
investments to stabilize high-risk process-contaminated facilities until ultimate disposition, 
including at Y-12’s Alpha 5 and Beta 4 facilities. In FY 2020, NNSA is using the authority 
Congress provided in the FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to pursue 
disposition of several high-risk process-contaminated excess facilities with a project cost of less 
than $50 million.  NNSA also remains committed to reducing the risk of non-process 
contaminated facilities by dispositioning facilities where possible.  For example, NNSA 
completed the Pantex Drummond Office Building (formerly known as the Administrative 
Support Complex) at the Pantex Plant outside of Amarillo, Texas in 2018.  This building 
provides 1,000 employees with modern, energy efficient workspace.  As a result, NNSA is now 
disposing of dilapidated, 1950s-era buildings and eliminating approximately $20 million in 
deferred maintenance.  In FY 2020, NNSA plans to fund the disposition of 24 additional 
facilities totaling 75,000 gross square feet. 
 
Defense Nuclear Security’s FY 2020 budget request is $778 million, an increase of $88 million, 
or 12.7 percent, over the FY 2019 enacted amount.  To execute its enterprise security program, 
DNS provides funding to the sites for: protective forces; physical security systems; information 
security and technical security; personnel security; nuclear material control and accountability; 
and security program operations and planning.  While NNSA faces challenges replacing and 
refreshing aging physical security infrastructure, we are making key investments in recapitalizing 
this infrastructure through the Security Infrastructure Revitalization Program (SIRP).  SIRP 
projects address aging high-priority security systems and related security infrastructure and 
equipment needs at all NNSA sites.  NNSA will continue to execute ongoing line-item security 
projects as well, including the effort to reduce the Y-12 Protected Area and use security 
resources more efficiently. In addition, NNSA will sustain counter unmanned aircraft systems 
implementation and operation at sites possessing Category 0/I quantities of special nuclear 
material. 
 
Information Technology and Cybersecurity enable every element of NNSA’s missions.  The FY 
2020 budget request is $309 million, an increase of $88 million, or 40 percent over the FY 2019 
request.  This increase will continue cybersecurity enhancements, bolster cybersecurity 
capabilities, and support the continuation of IT modernization efforts.  NNSA is making steady 
progress in enhancing and upgrading the components of the Enterprise Secure Computing 
environment to ensure that nuclear security enterprise missions can be completed without 
disruption.  As NNSA mission requirements expand in scope, the IT and cyber programs require 
modernization, expansion, and innovation in a commensurate fashion.  Cybersecurity is a 
defense and deterrence mechanism and a powerful tool.  In the current threat environment, 
NNSA cannot afford to neglect its cybersecurity capabilities, which serve as frontline assets that 
protect the information, systems, and networks NNSA depends on to execute our mission.  
 
Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Appropriation 
 
The FY 2020 budget request for the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account is $2 billion, an 
increase of $63 million, or 3.3 percent, above the FY 2019 request.  Defense Nuclear 
8 
 
 
Nonproliferation account activities address the entire nuclear threat spectrum by helping to 
prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, counter the threat of nuclear terrorism, and respond 
to nuclear and radiological incidents around the world.  The FY 2020 budget request funds two 
program mission areas under this account:  the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) 
Program and the Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response (NCTIR) Program.  
 
Nonproliferation Efforts  
 
The Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation works to: remove or eliminate vulnerable 
nuclear material; improve global nuclear security through multilateral and bilateral technical 
exchanges and training workshops; help prevent the illicit trafficking of nuclear and radioactive 
materials; secure domestic and international civilian buildings containing high-priority 
radioactive material; provide technical reviews of U.S. export license applications; conduct 
export control training sessions for U.S. enforcement agencies and international partners; 
strengthen the IAEA’s ability to detect and deter nuclear proliferation; advance U.S. capabilities 
to monitor arms control treaties and detect foreign nuclear programs; and maintain organizational 
readiness to respond to and mitigate radiological or nuclear incidents worldwide.  
 
The Material Management and Minimization (M3) program provides an integrated approach to 
addressing the risk posed by nuclear materials.  The FY 2020 budget request is $334 million, an 
increase of $40 million, or 13.5, percent above the FY 2019 enacted level.  The request supports 
the conversion or shut-down of research reactors and isotope production facilities that use HEU 
and the acceleration of developing new, non HEU-based molybdenum-99 production 
technologies in the United States.  Additionally, the request for M3 supports the removal and 
disposal of weapons-usable nuclear material, with priority on expediting the removal of surplus 
plutonium from the State of South Carolina and continuing the transition to the dilute and 
dispose strategy for surplus plutonium disposition.  
 
The Global Material Security program works with partner nations to increase the security of 
vulnerable nuclear and radioactive materials and improve the ability to deter, detect, and 
investigate illicit trafficking of these materials.  The FY 2020 budget request of $342 million, a 
decrease of $65 million, or 15.9 percent, below the FY 2019 enacted level and includes efforts to 
secure the most at-risk radioactive material in U.S. high-threat urban areas by the end of FY 
2020.  
 
The Nonproliferation and Arms Control program develops and implements programs to:  
strengthen international nuclear safeguards; control the proliferation of nuclear and dual-use 
material, equipment, technology and expertise; verify nuclear reductions and compliance with 
nonproliferation and arms control treaties and agreements; and address enduring and emerging 
proliferation challenges requiring the development of innovative policies and approaches.  The 
FY 2020 budget request for this program is $137 million, an increase of $6 million, or 5.8 
percent, above the FY 2019 enacted level.  This increase serves to advance and complete 
development of the new Export Compliance Assistance Program to deploy export control 
training across DOE and NNSA facilities, implement new 10 CFR Part 810 civil penalty 
authority pursuant to the FY 2019 NDAA, and establish and maintain a nonproliferation 
9 
 
 
enrichment testing and training platform in cooperation with the IAEA and select foreign 
partners. 
 
The Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development program supports innovative 
unilateral and multilateral technical capabilities to detect, identify, and characterize foreign 
nuclear weapons programs, illicit diversion of special nuclear material, and nuclear detonations 
worldwide.  The FY 2020 budget request for this program is $495 million, a decrease of $80 
million, or 13.9 percent, below the FY 2019 enacted level.  This decrease is due to shifting the 
HEU Reactor Conversion program to M3, as it is no longer in the research and development 
phase. 
 
Nonproliferation Construction consolidates construction costs for DNN projects.  The FY 2020 
budget request is $299 million, an increase of $79 million, or 35.9 percent, above the FY 2019 
enacted level.  Last year, NNSA terminated activities for the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility 
project to pursue the dilute and dispose option to fulfill the U.S. commitment to dispose of 34 
metric tons of plutonium.  The $220 million for the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility will be used 
to continue termination activities. The request also includes $79 million for the Surplus 
Plutonium Disposition project, which supports the dilute and dispose strategy.  
 
Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response (NCTIR) 
 
The Office of Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation (CTCP) provides effective capabilities 
to respond to any nuclear or radiological incident in the United States or abroad by applying the 
unique technical expertise found in NNSA’s nuclear security enterprise.  Highly trained 
personnel with specialized technical equipment maintain readiness to support lead federal 
agencies to find and render safe potential nuclear and radiological threat devices, to effectively 
manage the consequences of nuclear or radiological emergencies, and to support enhanced 
security operations for National Security Special Events (NSSE).   
 
NNSA’s Aerial Measuring System (AMS) provides airborne remote sensing in the event of a 
nuclear or radiological accident or incident within the continental United States, as well as in 
support of regularly scheduled NSSE.  The AMS fleet consists of three Beechcraft B200 fixed-
wing aircraft with an average age of 33 years and two Bell 412 helicopters with an average age 
of 24 years.  The age of the current aircraft leads to unscheduled downtime resulting in reduced 
mission availability.  A 2017 AoA on the AMS aircraft determined that recapitalization of the 
aging aircraft fleet is necessary to continue to provide Federal, State, and local officials with 
rapid radiological information following an accident or incident.  In FY 2019, the fixed-wing 
aircraft will be replaced, and the rotary-wing aircraft will be replaced in FY 2020. The FY 2020 
budget request for AMS recapitalization is $35.5 million. 
 
NNSA, in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), supports render safe 
teams at FBI field offices in 11 major American cities that are specially trained and equipped to 
identify and mitigate the function of a nuclear or radiological device (i.e, “stabilization”).  CTCP 
will conduct stabilization training and operations and begin transitioning to the Capability 
Forward initiative, under which lifesaving responses to a nuclear threat device will be 
accelerated.  Under this initiative, NNSA will provide additional training, equipment, and 
10 
 
 
technical support to the current 11 stabilization cities – eventually growing to 14 U.S. cities by 
FY 2022 – to allow FBI teams to execute render safe operations more rapidly.  CTCP will also 
improve and expand NNSA training facilities to accommodate the increased training 
requirements associated with regional render safe capabilities. 
 
The Nation’s nuclear incident response teams require the ability to communicate classified 
technical assessments in deployed, and often austere, environments using highly secure means.  
Information requirements encompass both nuclear device design information and intelligence 
assessments.  The equipment used by NNSA’s nuclear incident response teams is aging, 
resulting in increasing maintenance costs and heightened risks to the emergency response 
mission.  This budget includes funding for recapitalization of incident response equipment 
consistent with lifecycle planning to maintain operational readiness.  The budget also includes 
funding for state-of-the-art, secure, deployable communications systems that are interoperable 
with FBI and DoD mission partners that will help provide decision makers with real-time 
technical recommendations to mitigate nuclear terrorist threats.  
 
CTCP maintains an operational nuclear forensics capability in three distinct areas:  (1) pre-
detonation device disassembly and examination; (2) post-detonation assessment; and (3) analysis 
and characterization of nuclear materials.  The program maintains readiness to deploy device 
disposition and device assessment teams, conduct laboratory operations in support of analysis of 
bulk actinide forensics, and deploy subject matter expertise and operational capabilities in 
support of ground sample collections that support attribution of a nuclear detonation.   
 
The Emergency Operations program’s FY 2020 budget request includes $35.5 million under 
NCTIR to support NNSA’s Office of Emergency Operations.  This funding will support NNSA’s 
all-hazard emergency response capabilities that positively impact the Department’s emergency 
management continuity and devolution programs, enhance the ability of the Department to 
respond to, and recover from, catastrophic emergencies or other man-made hazards or natural 
disasters.   
 
Naval Reactors Appropriation 
 
Advancing Naval Nuclear Propulsion 
 
Nuclear propulsion for the U.S. Navy’s fleet of submarines and aircraft carriers is critical to the 
security of the United States and its allies as well as the security of global sea lanes.  The Office 
of Naval Reactors remains at the forefront of technological developments in naval nuclear 
propulsion by advancing new technologies and improvements in naval reactor performance.  
This preeminence provides the U.S. Navy with a commanding edge in naval warfighting 
capabilities.   
 
The Naval Reactors FY 2020 budget request is $1.65 billion, a decrease of $140 million or 
approximately 8 percent, below the FY 2019 enacted level.  This request reflects reductions to 
planned funding levels following additional funding enacted in FY 2018 for the S8G Prototype 
Refueling Overhaul and Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization Project.  In addition to supporting 
today’s operational fleet, the requested funding is the foundation for Naval Reactors to deliver 
11 
 
 
tomorrow’s fleet and recruit and retain a highly-skilled workforce.  One of Naval Reactors’ three 
national priority projects, continuing design and development of the reactor plant for the 
Columbia-Class submarine, featuring a life-of-ship core and electric drive, will replace the 
current Ohio-Class fleet and provide required deterrence capabilities for decades.  The project to 
refuel a research and training reactor in New York will enable 20 more years of research, 
development, and training for fleet operators.  Funding will also be used to support construction 
of a new spent fuel handling facility in Idaho that will facilitate long term, reliable processing 
and packaging of spent nuclear fuel from aircraft carriers and submarines.   
 
Naval Reactors has requested funding in FY 2020 to support these projects and fund necessary 
reactor technology development, equipment, construction, maintenance, and modernization of 
critical infrastructure and facilities.  By employing a small but high-performing technical base, 
the teams at Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Knolls Atomic Power 
Laboratory and Kesselring Site in New York; and the spent nuclear fuel facilities in Idaho can 
perform the research and development, analysis, engineering, and testing needed to support 
today’s fleet at sea and develop future nuclear-powered warships.  These laboratories also 
perform the technical evaluations that enable Naval Reactors to thoroughly assess emergent 
issues and deliver timely responses to provide nuclear safety and maximize operational 
flexibility.  
 
NNSA Federal Salaries and Expenses Appropriation 
 
The FY 2020 budget request for Federal Salaries and Expenses is $435 million, an increase of 
$25 million, or 6.0 percent, over the FY 2019 enacted level.  NNSA’s workforce is critical to the 
success of the Nation’s nuclear security enterprise.  NNSA must have a sufficient workforce, 
with the right capabilities, to ensure it can modernize the nuclear deterrent, recapitalize an aging 
infrastructure, and continue to meet the requirements of our nonproliferation and 
counterterrorism programs.  The 2018 NPR highlighted the need to properly support civilian 
personnel who protect the United States against nuclear threats. Effective deterrence would be 
impossible without the vital contributions our personnel make to the United States’ nuclear 
capabilities and deterrence. 
 
If NNSA is to be successful, funding alone will not be enough.  NNSA will need to have the 
necessary human resource authorities to attract and retain the best and brightest workforce from 
around the country, fostering interest through internships or skilled trade programs, and clearing 
them for classified work as quickly as possible.  This includes jobs not just in science, 
technology, and engineering but also manufacturing, maintenance, project and program 
management, and construction. 
 
Meeting NNSA’s growing mission requirements, as described in the 2018 NPR will require an 
aggressive hiring strategy for the next two years.  Since 2010, NNSA’s program funding has 
increased 50 percent, while staffing has decreased 10 percent.  The FY 2020 request increases 
NNSA staffing to 1,753 full-time equivalents (FTEs), an increase of 95 FTEs from the current 
on-board level of 1,658 Federal employees.  NNSA would benefit from the elimination of the 
overall cap on FTEs and excepted service personnel. 
 
12 
 
 
Last year, two independent studies identified NNSA’s unmet critical staffing needs.  The Office 
of Personnel Management (OPM) and NNSA’s Office of Cost Estimating and Program 
Evaluation (CEPE) found that NNSA was understaffed across all functions. The number of 
additional staff recommended in both studies would exceed the statutory cap on NNSA’s full-
time equivalent employees.  In March 2019, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
endorsed both OPM and CEPE’s staffing analyses’ conclusions of critical staff shortfalls and 
needs across multiple NNSA functions. GAO’s endorsement supports NNSA’s request for 
additional hiring authorities that would eliminate personnel caps, which would allow us to put 
significant resources behind our mission priorities.  NNSA is focusing on developing a concrete 
strategic staffing plan based on the information provided by the two independent studies and 
GAO’s report.  
 
Management and Performance 
 
Since 2011, NNSA has delivered approximately $2 billion in projects, a significant portion of 
NNSA’s total project portfolio, under budget.  We are committed to encouraging competition 
and increasing the universe of qualified contractors by streamlining major acquisition processes.  
NNSA will continue to focus on delivering timely, best-value acquisition solutions for all 
programs and projects, by using a tailored approach to contract structures and incentives that are 
appropriate for the special missions and risks at each site.  NNSA’s Office of Acquisition and 
Project Management continues to: lead improvements in contract and project management 
practices; provide clear lines of authority and accountability for program and project managers; 
improve cost and schedule performance; and ensure that Federal Project Directors and 
Contracting Officers possess the appropriate skill mix and professional certifications to manage 
NNSA’s work.   
 
Conclusion 
 
NNSA’s diverse missions are critical to the national security of the United States:  maintaining 
the safety, security, reliability, and effectiveness of the nuclear weapons stockpile; reducing the 
threat of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism around the world; and providing naval 
nuclear propulsion to the U.S. Navy’s fleet of aircraft carriers and submarines.  NNSA is mindful 
of its obligation to improve acquisition, safety, and security practices continually, and to use in a 
responsible manner, the resources entrusted to it by Congress and the American people.  By 
investing in our nuclear security enterprise and continuing our efforts to modernize our scientific, 
technical, and engineering capabilities and infrastructure, NNSA will continue to deliver on its 
nuclear security mission.

83,192 Dirksen Senate Office Building ,https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/04.03.19--Carson%20Testimony.pdf,"
 
 
U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Benjamin S. Carson, Sr. 
Testimony before Senate Committee on Appropriations  
Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and 
Related Agencies 
April 3, 2019 
 
 
Chairwoman Collins, Ranking Member Reed, and members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today 
to discuss the President’s proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Budget. 
 
This spending plan seeks $44.1 billion, an increase of seven percent over 
last year’s request.  
 
The proposed FY 2020 Budget also seeks a record amount of funding to 
reduce lead-based paint hazards and other home health and safety 
hazards. 
 
And this Budget will continue providing support for the nearly five million 
families HUD is currently serving through the Department’s rental 
assistance programs. 
 
In short, this Budget will support HUD’s combined efforts to provide safe, 
decent, and affordable housing for the American people, while being good 
stewards of taxpayer dollars. 
 
I would like to touch upon each of these areas individually. 
 
 
 
1 
 
Ending Homelessness 
 
This Administration is requesting nearly $2.6 billion to help local 
communities house and serve individuals and families who are living in 
their shelters and on their streets. This represents an increase of nearly 
three and a half percent over the amount enacted for Fiscal Year 2018. 
 
In my time in Washington, I have learned this is one area on which we can 
all agree. Preventing and ending homelessness remains a strategic goal of 
this Administration and, working with our local partners, we are seeing a 
positive and measurable impact. 
 
The data being reported to us from thousands of big cities and small towns 
alike tell us our collective efforts are working. Since 2010, we have cut 
Veteran homelessness in this country by half. Family homelessness is also 
on the decline, falling nearly 30 percent during this same period. 
 
This progress is happening because HUD’s homeless assistance programs, 
and the contributions from state and local governments, are being targeted 
to proven programs and strategies. Our Budget request further supports 
these local efforts. 
  
Promoting Healthy Homes 
    
HUD’s FY 2020 Budget includes a request for $290 million for the 
Department’s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. This 
request doubles the investment this Administration sought last year and is 
$60 million higher than the funding enacted in Fiscal Year 2018.  
 
We stopped putting lead in paint back in 1978 yet more than 20 million 
older homes still contain lead-based paint hazards. Amazingly, though 
lead poisoning is a preventable disease, we continue to see far too many 
children exposed to lead. 
 
As a doctor myself, it pained me that after treating a young child, they 
returned to a home that was not healthy. Quite simply, you cannot be 
healthy if your home is sick.  
2 
 
 
This undeniable link between health and housing is also driving an active 
campaign at HUD to overhaul the inspection process that the Department 
has been using for more than 20 years. 
 
HUD is dramatically reducing the advance notice we provide to public 
housing authorities and private owners of HUD-subsidized apartment 
developments before our inspections. We will now provide advance notice 
of just 14 calendar days before an inspection – a dramatic reduction from 
the current notice, which can frequently extend up to four months. 
 
It became painfully clear to us that too many public housing authorities 
and private landlords whom we contract with were using the weeks, in 
many cases months, before their inspection to make quick fixes, essentially 
gaming the system. 
 
HUD also launched a series of listening sessions around the nation to 
gather input about a planned pilot program to test innovative new 
approaches to inspecting HUD-assisted properties.  
 
These actions are part of a broader, top-to-bottom review of our inspections 
so we can be true to the promise of providing housing that's decent, safe 
and healthy to the millions of families we serve. 
 
As a general rule, HUD doesn’t inspect properties based upon local codes. 
But just last week, we instructed HUD inspectors to begin evaluating all 
public housing and privately-owned multifamily properties under contract 
with HUD for the presence of a working carbon monoxide detector. 
Additionally, in the coming weeks, HUD will send notices to PHAs and 
multifamily owners to encourage them to install carbon monoxide 
detectors.  
 
We continue to pursue every possible way we can ensure detectors are 
present in units that need them. This is literally a life and death issue. 
Ultimately, we want to effectuate change in the most expedient and 
efficient way possible and are using every lever at our disposal. 
 
3 
 
Continuing Rental Assistance 
 
Across our rental assistance programs, HUD has requested sufficient 
funding to ensure that all currently served households can continue to 
receive assistance, without any evictions. 
 
The Administration’s Budget continues support for 4.7 million HUD-
assisted households by increasing rental assistance to $38 billion. This 
request will allow HUD to maintain rent subsidies through our primary 
housing programs, including our tenant- and project-based Section 8 
programs.  
 
The Budget also proposes $644 million for the Section 202 program to 
support the rents of the elderly. In addition, the request includes $157 
million for the Section 811 program for persons with disabilities. These 
requested amounts represent funding increases of 7 percent and 12 percent, 
respectively, over last year’s proposed budget. 
 
While we are here to talk about the Administration’s funding request, I 
would like to point out that not every challenge can simply be solved with 
more financial resources. One of my priorities as Secretary is to work with 
our federal, state, local, and tribal partners on identifying and eliminating 
regulatory barriers that unnecessarily increase the cost of America’s 
housing supply in general and affordable housing supply in particular. 
These barriers increase the cost to HUD of operating its rental assistance 
programs in many markets.  
 
Pursuing Rent Reform 
 
The Administration’s FY 2020 Budget incorporates proposed reforms to 
HUD’s current rent structure, including incorporating the Administration’s 
uniform work requirements. These reforms will:  
 
➢ Require work for those who are able to work;  
➢ Reduce the administrative burden for housing authorities and 
residents alike; and 
➢ Allow greater flexibility to create local solutions to local challenges. 
4 
 
 
It is increasingly clear that the way we subsidize families in this country is 
broken. In fact, the way we calculate a family’s rent has not changed since 
President Reagan was in office. We invite Congress to engage in a dialogue 
with HUD to find common ground on the package of reforms in the 
Making Affordable Housing Work Act that the Department submitted last 
April. 
 
Supporting Affordable Housing 
 
Despite low unemployment and strong economic growth, we face stiff 
headwinds in our effort to increase access to affordable housing. The 
President’s Budget provides the tools we need to bring everybody to the 
table to ease the affordability crisis in many parts of our country. This crisis 
is not a federal problem, it is everybody’s problem. 
 
The nation’s public housing stock is experiencing a backlog of billions of 
dollars in capital needs. This results in the loss of thousands of units each 
year due to severe disrepair. The Budget again proposes to merge the 
Public Housing Capital Fund and the Public Housing Operating Fund and 
to give greater flexibilities to Public Housing Authorities to pay for these 
capital improvements.  
 
Meanwhile, the Budget expands HUD’s Rental Assistance Demonstration 
(RAD), allowing greater capital investment into deteriorating public 
housing. HUD is specifically requesting $100 million in dedicated funding 
for the RAD program and is requesting that the statutory cap on converting 
units, currently set at 455,000, be eliminated once and for all. RAD is 
proving itself to be an outstanding example of bringing the public and the 
private sectors together to accomplish amazing results.  
 
To date, RAD has placed more than one hundred thousand units of public 
housing on a more sustainable funding platform. These are affordable 
housing units we may have lost forever if not for RAD. And these are 
affordable housing units that will remain affordable. 
 
 
5 
 
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) 
 
Since its creation during the Great Depression, the FHA has been 
instrumental in supporting homeownership in this country. The 
President’s Budget continues this support by requesting $400 billion in 
single-family loan guarantee authority, as well as $150 million for FHA 
administrative contract expenses, including critically needed funding to 
improve FHA’s aging technology systems.  
 
FHA’s most recent annual report finds that the agency’s Mutual Mortgage 
Insurance (MMI) Fund is sound. The MMI Fund has a total economic value 
of nearly $35 billion and capital ratio above the statutory minimum for a 
fourth consecutive year. FHA will remain vigilant and continue to monitor 
economic trends in the housing market to ensure taxpayers are protected. 
 
We propose $30 billion in loan guarantee authority for FHA’s General and 
Special Risk Insurance programs, including programs that insure financing 
for multifamily housing and healthcare facilities. And we propose $550 
billion in loan guarantee authority for Ginnie Mae to continue supporting 
the secondary market for federally-insured loans.  
 
Fair Housing and Economic Opportunity 
 
To support HUD’s fair housing mission, the Budget proposes $62.3 million 
that will allow us to continue fighting housing discrimination, increase 
awareness of people’s rights, and enhance economic opportunity.  
 
Advancing economic opportunity for all is perhaps the fairest thing we can 
do. I’m proud to chair the White House Opportunity and Revitalization 
Council to help breathe new life into long-forgotten corners of our country. 
While we can be very proud of the economic growth we’re experiencing, 
there are still communities that have seen little or no new investment in 
generations.  
 
It is our intent to support over 8,700 Opportunity Zones across the nation—
economically distressed places that approximately 35 million Americans 
call home. We estimate these Opportunity Zones will attract over $100 
6 
 
billion in private investment to spur economic development and create 
jobs. This kind of medicine is precisely what a doctor would prescribe to 
heal communities where too many now live in poverty. 
 
Too often, new investments into distressed communities are here today, 
gone tomorrow. Opportunity Zones ensure that development and capital 
investment are available for the long-term.  
 
Eliminating/Reducing Ineffective Programs 
 
The Administration continues to propose eliminating the Community 
Development Block Grant program, the HOME Investment Partnerships 
Program, the Housing Trust Fund, the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, 
and the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program. In today’s 
budget environment, these programs are best supported by state and local 
governments.  
 
Conclusion 
 
This Budget advances our key priorities, including empowering HUD-
assisted families to achieve self-sufficiency. For generations, the idea of the 
federal government providing housing assistance meant only one thing – 
helping to pay the rent so families can have a roof over their heads.  
 
However, we must also think about how we can help families to access 
financial programs, educational opportunities, and higher paying jobs. In 
short, we must think beyond investing in bricks and mortar, and think 
about investing in people. This Budget does just that. 
 
Again, thank you for this opportunity to present to you the President’s FY 
2020 HUD Budget. 
 
I look forward to your questions.

Prepared Statement  
Of 
Vice Admiral Raquel Bono 
Director, Defense Health Agency 
 
REGARDING   
THE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM  
 
BEFORE THE 
  
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE  
DEFENSE SUBCOMMITTEE  
 
April 3, 2019 
 
Not for publication until released by the Committee 
 
 
 
  1 
Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member Durbin and members of the Subcommittee, we are 
pleased to represent the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Defense Health Agency 
(DHA) to present our medical program funding request for fiscal year (FY) 2020.  We are 
honored to represent the dedicated military and civilian medical professionals in the Military 
Health System (MHS) providing direct support to our combatant commanders and delivering or 
arranging health care for our 9.6 million beneficiaries.  
The Defense Health Program (DHP) request in the FY20 President’s Budget is fully 
aligned with our enduring commitments around the globe and with National Security and 
National Defense Strategies – along with the Department’s 3 lines of effort: to increase the 
lethality of our fighting force; expand strategic partnerships; and bring business reforms to DoD.     
Consistent with the National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA) for FY 2017 and 
2019, this budget reflects and supports a number of reforms to the Military Health System 
(MHS), including the multi-year transition of the management of military medical treatment 
facilities to the DHA to better integrate our system of readiness and health.  
For FY 2020, DoD is requesting approximately $33 billion for the DHP representing a 
4% decrease from last year’s enacted base budget. Almost $25 billion, or 77%, of our request 
directly supports patient care – delivered either in our military hospitals and clinics ($9.6 billion) 
or in the private sector ($15 billion).  
Over the last eight years, the total Unified Medical Budget (UMB) has grown at a slower 
rate than overall medical inflation in the country.  This successful management of cost growth 
can be attributed to a number of factors to include reforms to TRICARE reimbursement, the 
management of TRICARE contracts, health care delivery operations, pharmaceutical pricing, the 
  2 
migration to mandatory home delivery for many prescription drug refills, and the implementation 
of standardized business processes across the enterprise. 
Even with these successes, the Department remains vigilant about variation in year-to-
year expenditures, and we are appreciative that Congress continues to grant the Department 
carryover authority each year. Carryover authority allows DoD to maintain better funding flows 
to minimize disruption of health care services to our beneficiaries. We are committed to making 
our health care cost projections even more transparent in the year of execution, providing regular 
updates to the committee, and providing full visibility to Congress on potential plans for 
reprogramming funds within the fiscal year should that possibility unfold.  Furthermore, we will 
ensure that available funding is directed toward unfunded medical readiness and health care 
delivery requirements.  Carryover authority is an invaluable tool that provides the Department 
with needed flexibility to manage issues that emerge during the year of budget execution.  We 
request that it be continued in FY 2020.   
There are several significant programmatic issues detailed in the proposed FY 2020 
budget that we wish to highlight today, following analyses and reforms, that Congress directed 
the Department to undertake.  Taken together, these reforms represent the most significant 
change to the MHS in decades. They include: the realignment of our management structure for 
overseeing military medical treatment facilities (MTFs); the continued implementation and 
standardization of enterprise-wide activities in support of global medical support activities; and 
the restructuring of the Department’s medical personnel end strength.  
The FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) enacted sweeping reforms to 
the organization and management of military medicine. The over-arching direction from 
  3 
Congress was to consolidate and standardize many military health care functions in a way that 
better integrates readiness and health delivery throughout the Department. Included among these 
reforms: the expanded authority and responsibility of the DHA to manage MTFs worldwide; the 
authority to convert military medical positions to civilian; and the authority to adjust medical 
end-strengths and infrastructure in the MHS to maintain core competencies of health care 
providers.  
The DHA is a strategic enabler to the Department in supporting the readiness needs of 
our Combatant Commands and the Military Departments.  By building a management structure 
with an enterprise focus, we are ensuring a medically ready force and ready medical force for 
any contingency for which our forces are called to serve.  
The DHA will enter FY 2020 prepared to manage these expanded responsibilities for the 
delivery of care across the MHS.  On October 1, 2019, our current plan is to have all MTFs in 
the eastern region of the United States  transition to DHA administration and management – 
placing over 50% of facilities, admissions, and enrollees under the DHA. Enterprise activities for 
medical logistics, health facilities, and acquisition will be fully managed by the DHA.  We will 
also be preparing for the transition of the remaining facilities in the continental United States and 
Alaska, targeting an effective date of October 1, 2020.  The transition of overseas MTFs is 
planned for October 1, 2021.   
By consolidating management of MTFs under the DHA, the MHS is positioned to reduce 
unwarranted variation in both clinical and administrative functions. By standardizing approaches 
to quality management, the MHS seeks to improve health outcomes, reduce errors and allow 
service members and other patients to recover more quickly by reducing the incidence of 
  4 
hospital-based infections and other patient safety priorities. DHA’s pharmacy operations 
established a standardized formulary, an enterprise-approach to managing the transition to 
mandatory refills of prescription drugs through its home delivery program, and movement to 
standardized pharmacy automation support in MTFs. Standardization in areas such as medical 
logistics and contracting help ensure the military medical work force functions with common 
equipment and supplies both in garrison and in the deployed environment.    
With the expansion of DHA responsibilities directed both by the Secretary and by 
Congress, the Department is also streamlining military medical headquarters and reducing 
personnel overhead across the Military Departments. A ten percent (10%) reduction in 
headquarters medical personnel was applied across the Department in conjunction with the 
implementation of Section 702 of the NDAA for FY 2017, which consolidated responsibilities 
for management of military hospitals and clinics under the DHA.  
The Department continues to manage other initiatives that reduce the growth in health 
care costs while ensuring our health benefit remains an exceptional tool for recruitment and 
retention of military personnel and their families. These DHA cost-saving initiatives strengthen 
the Department’s financial posture without affecting access to care.  We will continue to produce 
significant savings from the TRICARE contracts by restructuring terms and cost control 
initiatives for TRICARE contractors, and will continue to restructure contracts that incentivize 
greater risk-sharing. Payments to long-term care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities 
are being adjusted in a phased process to align with Medicare rates.  We have increased IT 
savings through consolidation and rationalization of IT services and products. And, we have 
consolidated acquisition for education and training technologies and developed a DoD-wide 
common course catalog in our education and training programs.  
  5 
The modest increase in retiree copayments beginning in 2018 also continues to produce 
cost savings to the Department. The Department is not proposing any further changes to patient 
cost-sharing in FY 2020.  
The Department’s budget proposes to increase investments in medical programs and 
services that directly support our medical readiness obligations. Notable areas include: increases 
for Air Force patient movement equipment, combat casualty care training, medical material and 
increased support for operations in the European Command, Central Command, and Africa 
Command areas of operations; and expansion of physical therapists in Marine Center Medical 
homes.  
Another critical support component of our readiness mission is the fielding of a 
modernized Electronic Health Record (EHR) – MHS GENESIS.  In August 2015, the 
Department awarded a multi-billion dollar contract for its new EHR system. In 2017, we began 
the initial deployment of MHS GENESIS in the Pacific Northwest. The purpose of the initial 
operational capability (IOC) deployment to four medical facilities in Washington State was to 
evaluate the system for full-scale deployment, identify additional change management issues, 
and resolve infrastructure and security concerns.  
We are encouraged with the initial success of this deployment.  Ms. Cummings’ 
testimony provides specific examples of how MHS GENESIS has improved patient care and 
patient safety – to include the reduction of thousands of duplicative lab tests, and improvements 
in medication reconciliation at the time of patient discharge.  We are proceeding with full 
deployment of MHS GENESIS world-wide over the coming five years.  Later in FY 2019 we 
will begin deployment to additional sites in Northern California and Idaho. Together with the 
  6 
Department of Veterans Affairs’ decision to deploy the same commercial product in their 
system.  
The DHA has also established an MHS Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), 
similar to programs established by individual States and territories to help combat the national 
opioid crisis.  Through this initiative, DHA will share prescription information with other State 
entities to ensure patients do not receive overlapping opioid prescriptions that can worsen an 
opioid use disorder or cause an overdose.  
We remain committed to sustaining the superb battlefield medical care we have provided 
to our Warfighters and the world-class treatment and rehabilitation for those who bear the 
wounds of past military conflicts.  Our proposed FY 2020 budget sustains the medical research 
and development portfolio, allowing us to continually improve our capability to reduce mortality 
from wounds, injuries, and illness sustained on the battlefield, and in the execution of our 
readiness responsibilities.  
Specific research programs support efforts in combat casualty care, traumatic brain 
injury, psychological health, extremity injuries, burns, vision, hearing and other medical 
challenges that are militarily relevant and support the warfighter.  This budget proposes 
increased funding for battlefield injury research and establishes a permanent baseline for 
mission-essential research. Additionally, we have sustained funding for technology and advanced 
concept development. The successful investment of research dollars has also allowed us to move 
proven advances in areas such as clinical enterprise intelligence and the Defense Occupational 
and Environmental Health Readiness System into Operations and Maintenance funding lines, 
and out of medical research.  
  7 
The process established, through the Congressionally-Directed Medical Research 
Program (CDMRP), allows the Department to also ensure innovative, external research 
opportunities identified by Congress are well-managed.  We intend to sustain our CDMRP 
management infrastructure into the future.  
As part of the reforms directed by the FY 2017 and 2019 NDAAs, the Department has 
undertaken several initiatives regarding our military medical personnel. First, the Military 
Departments, the Joint Staff, and organizations within the Office of the Secretary of Defense 
conducted the required assessment of the operational medical requirements needed to support the 
National Defense Strategy. As a result of this assessment, the Military Departments plan to 
reduce overall uniformed medical positions. This proposed restructuring will permit the Military 
Departments to repurpose active duty medical end strength for other operational/modernization 
efforts needed to support the National Defense Strategy.  
The Military Departments and DHA are working closely together on the process for 
implementing these reductions responsibly and carefully. We are now identifying the alternative 
models – civilian hires, contract staff, military-civilian partnerships, or use of existing TRICARE 
networks – that will best meet the needs of beneficiaries.   We will continue to meet all standards 
for timely access for our beneficiaries, and while care delivery locations may change, our 
commitment to provide high quality healthcare will remain steadfast. 
As part of the MHS’s effort to optimize our operations, we continue to standardize and 
strengthen our financial management tools.  We are proud that the DHA was certified as audit 
compliant, as part of the broader federal government and DoD goals to achieve full audit 
compliance.   We are continuing our implementation of a common cost accounting methodology 
  8 
within the MHS that will improve accountability and transparency to the Department, the 
Services, Congress, and the public with improved insight into how resources are allocated in 
support of our mission.  The DHA has adopted the Army’s General Fund Enterprise Business 
System (GFEBS) as its cost accounting system, and the Uniformed Services University of Health 
Sciences has also migrated to this system. Navy Medicine is in the process of migrating from the 
Standard Accounting and Reporting System – Field Level in the coming years and we intend to 
begin transitioning the Air Force shortly after the Navy is complete. 
Similar to our cost accounting standardization, we are proud of our efforts to standardize 
and centralize our performance management systems.  We have created standard MHS-wide 
performance dashboards that provide stakeholders – both medical and line leadership – at all 
levels of the military with visibility into how we are preforming on key metrics.  These 
dashboards show longitudinal performance in measures of readiness, health, access, quality, 
safety and cost.  For readiness, we monitor both the medical readiness of the force – particularly 
the number of individuals with deployment-limiting conditions, as well as the readiness of the 
medical forces.  We are expanding our ability to assess the number of military providers who are 
meeting our established “Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs)” clinical competency and 
proficiency  levels.  We monitor critical indicators of quality and safety – – that point us toward 
high reliability as a system of care. Access to primary care and specialty care are measured along 
with patient satisfaction to ensure we are meeting patient expectations. And “costs per member 
per month” provide us with a metric used throughout the health industry to measure the 
efficiency with which we deliver needed medical services.  
Our dashboards can be viewed at an enterprise level, by Service, by market, and by 
individual hospital or clinic. We have adapted the dashboard to provide us with metrics on the 8 
  9 
MTFs that now report directly to the DHA, and will continue to adapt this management system 
as the MTF transition progresses. Commanders can assess their performance against expected 
benchmarks, against peer institutions, and – where possible – against civilian sector performance 
as well.  These dashboards help us to both assess how we are doing in these areas, and where we 
need to invest resources, training, or management attention in order to achieve further 
improvement.   
The FY 2020 budget represents a balanced, comprehensive strategy that aligns with the 
Secretary’s priorities and begins to fulfill our requirements associated with congressionally 
directed system reforms.  We look forward to working with you over the coming months to 
further refine and articulate our objectives in a manner that improves value for everyone – our 
warfighters, our combatant commanders, our patients, our medical force, and the American 
taxpayer. 
Thank you for inviting us here today to speak with you about the essential integration  
between readiness and health, and about our plans to further improve our health system in 
support of the National Defense Strategy and for our beneficiary population.

Introduction 
Good morning, Chairman Capito, Ranking Member Tester, and Members of the Committee.  My 
name is Peter Gaynor, and I am the Acting Administrator of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA).  It is an honor to appear before you today to discuss FEMA’s 
Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget and how it represents the strategic vision I intend to continue 
executing for this Agency and emergency management.  
 
The last time FEMA had the opportunity to testify before the Senate on the budget was in April 
of 2015.  FEMA was a different agency then; at that time our greatest challenge was the 2005 
Disaster Season, which included Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.  In the years since, we 
have matured as a professional organization.  The past two years included six major hurricanes 
and five historic wildfires, and we continue to refine our business processes as we learn from 
each new disaster.    
 
As a result of the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons, FEMA has experienced an unprecedented pace 
of operations.  Between January 2017 and December 2018, the President approved 143 major 
disaster and emergency declarations.  Additionally, FEMA supported 191 Fire Management 
Assistance Grants (FMAGs).  These two disaster seasons were significant in their devastation of 
life and property, as well as the costs to affected communities and taxpayers.  
 
Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria caused a combined $265 billion in damage and were each 
among the top five costliest hurricanes on record.  In response, FEMA coordinated large 
deployments of federal personnel and commodities, both before and after the hurricanes’ 
landfalls, to support response and initial recovery efforts across 270,000 square miles.  These 
deployments included more than 17,000 FEMA and federal Surge Capacity Force personnel, and 
nearly 17,000 personnel from various offices of the Department of Defense.  FEMA facilitated 
logistics missions that moved more than $2 billion worth of commodities and supplies across 
several states and territories, using multiple modes of transportation.  FEMA Urban Search and 
Rescue Task Forces, comprised of state and local emergency responders, saved or assisted nearly 
9,500 lives across the three hurricanes.  In total, the hurricanes and California wildfires affected 
more than 47 million people—nearly 15 percent of the nation’s population.  FEMA registered 
nearly 4.8 million households for assistance. 
 
Today, FEMA remains steadfast in its commitment to support the needs of disaster survivors. 
We continue to work tirelessly to support state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) partners in 
responding to and recovering from disasters and mitigating against future risk.  We overcame 
many challenges, and we have gained invaluable knowledge which we have incorporated into 
our strategy going forward.  We continue to adapt and expand our understanding of emergency 
management to ensure that we can best deliver our services to support our partners’ ability to 
build more resilient communities, lessen the impacts of disasters, and ultimately help individuals 
get back on their feet quickly.  
 
 
2 
 
FY 2020 President’s Budget 
 
Today, I would like to discuss FEMA’s FY 2020 Budget in terms of the goals and objectives of 
the Agency’s 2018 – 2022 Strategic Plan.  FEMA developed this plan for supporting the Nation 
before, during, and after disasters and improving the Agency’s execution of its fundamental 
mission of helping people during their greatest time of need.  This plan seeks to unify and further 
professionalize emergency management across the Nation, and we encourage the whole 
community to join us in embracing these priorities.  To do this and to drive both short and long-
term funding decisions, the plan establishes three strategic goals for FEMA:  
•  Build a culture of preparedness;  
•  Ready the Nation for catastrophic disasters; and 
•  Reduce the complexity of FEMA.  
 
Build a Culture of Preparedness 
 
The Nation’s ability to weather storms and disasters without experiencing loss significantly 
reduces our risk.  The most successful way to achieve disaster resilience is through preparedness, 
including mitigation.   
 
Building a Culture of Preparedness within our communities and our governments will support a 
National effort to be ready for the worst disasters.  Everyone should be prepared when disaster 
strikes, and we must all understand our local and community risks, reflect the diversity of those 
we serve, and foster partnerships that allow us to connect with a diverse Nation.  People who are 
prepared will be able to act quickly and decisively in the face of disasters, thereby preventing 
death and injuries, minimizing loss of property, and allowing for a more rapid and efficient 
recovery.  When communities are impacted, they should ensure that they rebuild infrastructure 
better, tougher, and stronger to protect taxpayer investment and promote economic stability.  The 
FY 2020 Budget requests $2.3 billion in preparedness and mitigation grants to help achieve this 
goal. 
 
Also critical to these efforts is the Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA), which the President 
signed into law on October 5, 2018.  Key provisions in this law enable greater investment in pre-
disaster mitigation; support efforts to reduce risks from future disasters after fires; increase state 
capacity to manage disaster recovery; and provide greater flexibility to survivors with 
disabilities.  The FY 2020 Budget request includes funding to begin implementing key elements 
of DRRA to include earthquake related hazard planning and wildfire mitigation.  Further, FEMA 
is working to implement the National Public Infrastructure Pre-disaster Mitigation Grant 
Program, which was authorized by DRRA and will provide a larger and more reliable source of 
funding for States to invest in pre-disaster mitigation projects.  FEMA looks forward to 
continuing to work with our Federal, SLTT, and private sector partners as we continue work on 
implementing this legislation. 
 
While we will never be able to eliminate all risk, we must mitigate the known risks as much as 
possible.  FEMA will work with communities and insurers to close the insurance gap across the 
nation and is working to double insurance coverage.  Managing risk through insurance, including 
the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), helps communities to recover faster following 
3 
 
disasters and reduces overall costs for taxpayers. The FY 2020 Budget includes a request for 
$5.1 billion to support operating the NFIP. 
 
Ready the Nation for Catastrophic Disasters 
Catastrophic disasters, including low- and no-notice incidents, can overwhelm the government at 
all levels and threaten National security.  They are life-altering incidents for those impacted, 
causing a high number of fatalities and widespread destruction.  Catastrophic disasters disrupt 
lives and hurt our communities – economically and socially.  Readiness is critical for FEMA and 
our partners to ensure that the response and recovery missions are appropriately executed and 
successful.   
 
The Nation’s readiness depends on emergency management professionals who execute the 
mission on behalf of Federal and SLTT governments.  This requires a scalable and capable 
National incident workforce that can adapt and deploy to a changing risk landscape, greater 
integration with our partners at all levels, and the ability to communicate and coordinate 
effectively in every situation.   
 
In 2017, FEMA announced our intent to embed FEMA staff within SLTT partner offices to help 
provide a more coordinated FEMA presence to improve customer service and provide targeted 
technical assistance to help build capacity and address capability gaps.  The first FEMA 
Integration Team (FIT) was placed in the North Carolina State Emergency Management Office 
in 2018.  Prior to Hurricane Florence, the North Carolina FIT developed an understanding of the 
state’s capabilities, gaps, and processes, and helped to develop and share potential needs.  
Because of the team’s proximity and co-location, the FIT began incident preparations for 
Hurricane Florence much sooner and with a better understanding of issues, prior to 
landfall.  Currently, FEMA has FITs embedded in 16 states with more to follow.  The FY 2020 
Budget request includes $1.7 million and 25 positions to support the FIT initiative.   
 
To overcome communications challenges in Puerto Rico during and after Hurricane Maria, 
FEMA deployed its Mobile Emergency Response Support (MERS) resources with mobile 
satellite, mobile radio, and logistics support services to provide command and control 
communications, situational awareness, and program delivery.  Building on lessons learned from 
FEMA’s response to Hurricane Maria and other disasters, the FY 2020 Budget request includes 
$6.0 million for the acquisition of six Mobile Emergency Office Vehicles (MEOV).  MEOVs 
provide critical command and control capability in the field.  MEOVs are the primary command 
and control platforms utilized to support all-hazards response.  
 
FEMA added more than 200 agencies to the list of state, local, territorial, and tribal authorities 
with access and ability to use the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) to send 
emergency alerts and warnings to the public.  We also provided technical alert and warning 
assistance and support to multiple state and local agencies including for wildfires in California 
and for hurricanes and volcanoes in Hawaii, and live public alert tests for the Navaho Nation.  
FEMA’s FY 2020 Budget request includes $9.6 million to modernize five IPAWS Primary Entry 
Point (PEP) Stations. 
 
4 
 
The FY 2020 Budget also includes a request for $3.0 million to expand the distribution center in 
Hawaii to gain an additional 54,000 square feet to increase stock levels of pre-positioned life-
saving and life-sustaining commodities maintained in areas of operation outside the continental 
United States.  FEMA’s stock target for food in the State of Hawaii is being increased from 
558,000 meals to 3.81 million meals.  Water stock targets are increasing from 372,000 liters to a 
capacity of 5.71 million liters.  
 
In addition to building core capabilities in states and other jurisdictions, FEMA is improving 
response efforts through the stabilization of lifelines across critical infrastructure sectors.  
Lifelines provide indispensable services that enable the continuous operation of critical business 
and government functions during a response effort, and without prompt restoration would risk 
health, safety or national economic security.  Solutions to stabilize lifelines, such as food, water, 
and sheltering, do not fit within a single construct (i.e. an Emergency Support Function [ESF] or 
Recovery Support Function), so we must provide cross-sector coordination to effectively 
stabilize critical lifelines.  Focusing on these lifelines and related impacts will allow decision-
makers to move rapidly and will better utilize limited resources to target towards the restoration 
of critical functions during response efforts.  
 
Reduce the Complexity of FEMA 
FEMA must be flexible and adaptable to meet the needs of individuals and communities, and it 
must deliver assistance and support in as simple a manner as possible.  We must innovate and 
leverage new technology to reduce complexity, increase efficiency, and improve outcomes.   
 
Promoting simpler, less complex processes to streamline FEMA and the support FEMA provides 
to individuals and communities makes it easier for employees to do their work, and the Agency 
can better care for those supported.  A simplified FEMA – one that streamlines survivor and 
grantee experiences and provides straightforward process and policies for staff – will decrease 
administrative burdens, improve the stewardship of Federal taxpayer dollars, and allow for a 
more efficient and effective execution of our mission.  For example, FEMA is consolidating and 
updating all FEMA Individual Assistance (IA) policies and program guidance to simplify and 
streamline information about IA programs. 
 
FEMA also is reducing the complexity by modernizing its legacy Information Technology 
systems.  The FY 2020 Budget includes: 
•  $42.1 million to modernize FEMA’s grants management system.  
•  $18.3 million for IT infrastructure to increase the security of core IT business areas, 
improve resilient communications, remediate cybersecurity vulnerabilities and replace 
critical end-of-life infrastructure.   
•  $9.1 million to modernize FEMAs enterprise data analytics capability to enable FEMA to 
work smarter through data analytics and ultimately deliver better outcomes for survivors 
and communities.  
•   $8.1 million to modernize FEMA’s financial management system.  
 
Conclusion 
The FY 2020 President’s Budget provides FEMA with the resources to help people before, 
during and after disasters while allowing us to strive for our vision of a prepared and more 
5 
 
resilient Nation.  Every disaster is unique with its own set of challenges, yet in the spirit of 
constant improvement, FEMA is exploring how to incentivize investments that reduce risk, 
including pre-disaster mitigation, and reduce disaster costs at all levels.  
 
FEMA’s work continues to increase at a faster rate and our goals and initiatives were developed 
to match the demands placed on this agency.  That said, the unprecedented pace of operations 
FEMA has experienced, and the improvements needed to respond to implement these goals and 
lessons learned has placed increased strains on FEMA’s non-disaster funding, and I look forward 
to working with Congress to ensure the men and women of FEMA are funded at the appropriate 
levels. 
 
Thank you again for the opportunity to speak with you and your continued support of FEMA and 
its vital mission.  I look forward to answering your questions at this time.

TESTIMONY OF 
Andrew R. Wheeler 
 
ADMINISTRATOR 
U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 
 
BEFORE THE 
 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED 
AGENCIES 
U.S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
 
April 3, 2019 
 
Good morning, Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Udall, and members of the 
subcommittee.  I am joined by Holly Greaves, EPA’s Chief Financial Officer, and 
we  are  here  today  to  discuss  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency’s  (EPA’s) 
proposed FY 2020 budget, which supports the goals and objectives in the FY 2018-
FY 2022 EPA Strategic Plan.  
 
The FY 2020 Budget Request reflects President Trump’s vision of  responsible 
stewardship of taxpayer dollars and critical investments in the nation’s health, safety, 
and long-term prosperity. The Budget supports ongoing work at EPA to reduce 
unnecessary  regulatory  burdens  while  investing  in  areas  that  demand  greater 
attention, such as protecting children from lead exposure and other environmental 
harms through a new Healthy Schools Grant Program and providing funding to begin 
implementing the America’s Water Infrastructure Act (AWIA).  
 
The proposed Budget ensures that the Agency can continue the President’s bold 
agenda and the tremendous progress we have made over the past two years. The U.S. 
is a global leader with respect to clean air and access to safe drinking water, and we 
are cleaning up contaminated lands at the fastest pace in over a decade. At the same 
time, EPA has supported the President’s record economic gains by finalizing 38 
deregulatory actions and saving Americans more than $3 billion in regulatory costs. 
We have an additional 39 actions in development projected to save billions more in 
 
1 
 
regulatory  costs.  The  Trump  Administration  is  proving  that  environmental 
protection and historic economic growth can go hand-in-hand.  
 
In my testimony, I will highlight how the President’s budget would continue this 
progress. 
 
I believe that water issues, from drinking water to marine litter to infrastructure, are 
the largest and most immediate environmental and public health issues affecting the 
world right now. The Budget Request provides critical support in the area of water 
quality protection.  
  
Right now, over two billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water and 
proper sanitation, leading to anywhere from one to three million deaths every year. 
And those most likely to die from a lack of safe drinking water are young children. 
According to the United Nations, nearly a thousand children die every day due to 
preventable water and sanitation-related diseases. We believe that these children 
deserve our immediate attention, and we are elevating our work with our federal 
partners, like USAID, to improve global water security.   
 
Here in the U.S., we have made tremendous progress on this front. In the 1970s, 
more than 40 percent of our nation’s drinking water systems failed to meet even the 
most basic health standards. Today, over 92 percent of community water systems 
meet all health-based standards, all the time. 
 
We still face challenges, however. Our nation’s children are particularly vulnerable 
to the health impacts of unsafe drinking water, especially lead exposure. Through 
the new Federal Action Plan to Reduce Childhood Lead Exposures and Associated 
Health  Impacts,  EPA  is  coordinating  with  our  federal  counterparts  to  reduce 
exposure to lead where children live, learn, and play.  
 
To bolster these efforts, the FY 2020 Budget proposes $50 million to establish a new 
Healthy Schools Grant Program. This flexible grant program will help our state and 
local  partners,  including  school  systems  and  administrators,  minimize  asthma 
triggers, reduce exposure to lead or other toxics, and ensure children have access to 
clean and safe learning environments. This new program is a top priority for the 
Agency, and we look forward to partnering with Congress to advance this effort.  
 
2 
 
 
We are also moving forward to update the Lead and Copper rule for the first time in 
over two decades. We will get this rule out in the summer of 2019, and we will get 
it done right. Our proposal would ensure that we address the most corrosive pipes in 
the most at-risk communities first. These communities can’t afford to wait five, ten, 
or twenty years to have their lead pipes replaced. EPA staff is currently monitoring 
and mapping the location of the highest-risk lead pipes so we can focus our work on 
the most impacted areas of the country first.  
 
The other dimension of our water challenges is our ability to identify and address 
potential sources of drinking water contamination. Source protection can reduce the 
need for additional drinking water treatment and avoid the associated costs. EPA is 
stepping up its leadership on this front as well.  
 
In February, EPA released its Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Action 
Plan. We utilized each of our program offices to produce the most comprehensive, 
multi-media research and action plan ever issued by the Agency to address an 
emerging chemical of concern. And for the first time ever, we held simultaneous 
press conferences in all ten of our Regional Offices to roll out the plan. This will be 
our approach moving forward on issues of emerging concern.   
 
On the marine litter issue, billions of pounds of waste enter our oceans each year, 
harming marine life and coastal economies.  Through programs like Trash Free 
Waters, EPA is helping foreign governments and organizations capture marine litter 
or prevent it from reaching the ocean in the first place. When I travel to the G7 in 
France in May and the G20 in Japan in June, I will make the issue of marine litter a 
priority. 
 
On infrastructure, we estimate that more than $700 billion will be needed to upgrade 
water  infrastructure  in  the  U.S.  alone  over  the  next  20  years.  The  President 
understands that modernizing our nation’s aging infrastructure is critical to public 
health and prosperity. At EPA, this means that we will continue to make investments 
in water infrastructure that not only safeguard our nation’s precious water resources 
but also create well-paying jobs and ensure taxpayer dollars achieve the maximum 
return on investment.  
 
 
3 
 
The FY 2020 budget includes a 25 percent increase to the Water Infrastructure 
Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program from last year’s request. The $25 
million, including $20 million in credit subsidy, provided for WIFIA could deliver 
more than $2 billion in direct credit assistance, which, when combined with other 
funding resources, could spur over $4 billion in total infrastructure investments.  
 
This new program is already producing tremendous results. To date, EPA has issued 
eight WIFIA loans totaling more than $2 billion in federal credit assistance. Not only 
will these funds improve public health for hundreds of thousands of Americans, it is 
also estimated these projects will create over 6,000 jobs. This is just the beginning. 
This past year, we invited an additional 39 projects across the nation to apply for 
WIFIA loans, which, when approved and combined with other funding sources, 
could help finance over $10 billion dollars in water infrastructure and create up to 
155,000 jobs. 
 
While most water systems consistently provide safe and reliable drinking water, 
many small systems face their own unique challenges. To address these needs, 
President Trump signed the bipartisan America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 
(AWIA) on October 23, 2018. While funding for these important new mandates was 
not included in the FY 2019 budget Congress recently enacted, EPA proposes 
funding of $83 million in this Budget Request to begin implementation of the law, 
including five new grant programs. Funding AWIA would expand EPA’s ability to 
invest in water infrastructure in even more communities across the country.  
 
The  Budget  Request  also  includes  approximately  $2  billion  in  federal  dollars 
towards the two State Revolving Funds (SRFs) to assist our implementing partners 
in  rebuilding  aging  water  infrastructure.  The  combination  of  the  federal 
capitalization grants provided over more than twenty years, required state match, 
loan repayments, and interest flows back into each state revolving fund, creating 
approximately $80 billion currently revolving at the state level. This recycling of 
funds  results  in  additional  funding  available  well  beyond  the  annual  federal 
investment in both SRF programs. Across the SRFs, WIFIA loans, and the new 
AWIA programs, we are providing robust support for water infrastructure project 
investments.  
 
 
4 
 
When it comes to reducing air pollution, we are moving forward with common-sense 
reforms that will help more regions throughout the nation reach attainment of the 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). 
 
Areas  in  nonattainment  face  a  variety  of  consequences,  including  increased 
regulatory burdens and restrictions on infrastructure investments. The Agency is 
working  across  multiple  fronts  to  bring  these  areas  into  attainment,  such  as 
converting Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) into State Implementation Plans 
(SIPs) or aggressively tackling the backlog of SIPS we inherited. The Agency has 
converted an average of almost one FIP into a SIP each month since March 2017. 
The Trump EPA inherited a backlog of more than 700 SIPs, and we’ve taken final 
action on over 400 SIPs to date.  
 
We are also moving forward with the Cleaner Trucks Initiative. Since 2000, nitrogen 
oxide (NOx) emissions in the U.S. have been reduced by 52 percent. However, it is 
estimated that heavy-duty trucks will be responsible for one-third of NOx emissions 
from transportation in 2025, and it’s been nearly 20 years since EPA last set NOx 
emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks. By working closely with states and the 
private sector, we will reduce NOx emissions from heavy-duty trucks, which is not 
required by statute or court order, but will help nonattainment areas reach attainment. 
 
The  cleanup  and  redevelopment  of  contaminated  lands  play  a  crucial  role  in 
revitalizing communities throughout the country. I’m proud to report that in Fiscal 
Year 2018, EPA deleted all or part of 22 sites from the National Priorities List (NPL), 
the largest number of deletions in one year since Fiscal Year 2005. We believe that 
a site on the National Priorities List should be just that – a national priority. If it has 
languished on the NPL for decades, then it was not a priority. We are changing that. 
We are in the process of cleaning up some of the nation’s largest, most complex sites 
and returning them to productive use. 
 
While  the  Agency  continues  to  request  robust  funding  to  revitalize  lands,  it’s 
important to remember that annual appropriations are just one source of funding to 
help facilitate the cleanup and restoration of contaminated lands. In 2018 alone, the 
Superfund Enforcement program secured private party commitments totaling $613 
million. Approximately 60 percent of ongoing remedial construction projects are 
 
5 
 
performed  by  Potentially  Responsible  Parties.  EPA’s  enforcement  program 
continues to encourage private investment in the cleanup and reuse of sites. 
  
Our next responsibility is ensuring that chemicals used in commerce and sold in the 
marketplace are safe for public use. I’m proud to report that EPA continues to meet 
the major statutory deadlines of the amended Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). 
 
We’ve issued rules addressing the prioritization process, the risk evaluation 
process, and the TSCA inventory, while also developing a new fees program.  
 
Not only that, we are well on our way to completing draft risk evaluations for the 
first 10 chemicals; we published a final strategy to reduce animal testing; we 
published a final mercury reporting rule; we released three sets of guidance 
regarding confidential business information; and we released an updated Chemical 
Substance Inventory. 
 
We recently announced the next 20 high and 20 low existing chemicals that we 
will prioritize for risk evaluation. In FY 2020, the Agency will begin risk 
evaluations for the next round of twenty high-priority chemicals.  
 
In terms of risk management, earlier this month, we finalized a ban on retail sales 
of methylene chloride for consumer paint and coating removal – the first risk 
management action under Section 6 of amended TSCA. After analyzing the health 
impacts and listening to affected families, we took action to protect retail 
consumers. 
 
As for new chemicals, we are reviewing submissions consistent with the statute 
while increasing the transparency of our decisions. We are committed to reducing 
our backlog of approximately 400 new chemical submissions within six months. 
What EPA is accomplishing should give confidence to American consumers and 
certainty to the manufacturers. 
 
To ensure that our actions are effective and durable, EPA is assisting the regulated 
community in attaining and maintaining compliance with environmental laws and, 
where necessary, punishing actors that do not comply with those laws.  
 
 
6 
 
At one end of the spectrum, we are increasing compliance through self-audits, which 
are often the quickest way to correct environmental harms. At the other end of the 
spectrum, we are deterring non-compliance by stepping up criminal cases. We 
increased the number of new criminal cases in FY 2018, reversing a downward trend 
that began in 2011.  
 
In Fiscal Year 2018, EPA enforcement actions required the treatment, disposal, or 
elimination of 809 million pounds of pollutants and waste – almost twice as much 
compared to 2017. And in January, EPA and the Department of Justice announced 
a $490 million settlement with Fiat Chrysler for cheating U.S. emissions standards. 
We will vigorously enforce our nation’s environmental laws, and we will ensure that 
hardworking Americans that follow the law and play by the rules do not suffer a 
competitive disadvantage. 
 
Within the Agency itself, we are improving how efficiently and effectively we carry 
out our core responsibilities. In FY 2018, the Agency introduced the EPA Lean 
Management  System  (ELMS),  which  has  enhanced  the  Agency’s  performance 
management framework. For the first time, EPA is reviewing its performance via 
new measures and taking corrective action on a monthly, rather than annual, basis. 
We  created  over  600  performance  measures  across  all  national  programs  and 
regional offices. We’re already beginning to see dramatic improvements, such as 
reducing the backlog of new permit applications older than six months by 34 percent 
between June and November 2018. The deployment of ELMS will help us maximize 
the skill sets of EPA staff and ensure that we are agile and responsive to the needs 
of all Americans.    
 
We want the public to know that when they encounter environmental threats, we will 
address them head on. And we want the world to know, that when they encounter 
environmental threats, we are ready to help. This is the type of leadership that gives 
confidence to the public, certainty to the regulated community, and reassurance to 
our allies around the globe. This is the type of leadership you can expect from 
President Trump and his Administration. Thank you for the opportunity to speak 
with you today. I look forward to answering your questions.

  WRITTEN TESTIMONY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 
FISCAL YEAR 2020 BUDGET REQUEST 
 
Chairman Moran, Vice Chair Shaheen, and members of the Senate Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, thank you for 
this opportunity to discuss President Trump’s Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Request for 
the U.S. Department of Commerce.  
 
We appreciate your continued leadership in propelling the American economy 
forward and ensuring our national security.  You help us achieve our mission of 
creating a platform of economic growth and opportunity.  We extend our heartfelt 
thanks for your ongoing support. 
 
Under the Secretary’s stewardship, our requested resource allocations in the Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2020 Budget are centrally focused on helping American businesses and 
industries compete globally while improving the economic conditions and 
everyday lives of the American people. 
 
The FY 2020 Budget Request for the Department of Commerce is $12.2 billion, 
which represents an increase of approximately $766 million from the FY 2019 
enacted level.   
 
We seek to sustain the Nation’s economic successes by carrying forward key 
strategic investments from FY 2019 and introducing new initiatives that are critical 
for creating the conditions for further economic growth and opportunities for all 
Americans.  This will further advance our nation’s position as a global economic 
powerhouse and the industries that collectively serve as the economic engine here 
in the United States and abroad. 
 
The FY 2020 Budget represents the Administration’s diligent effort to assess the 
Department’s programs.  
 
As a result, the Budget balances our ongoing commitments to protect the 
Department’s mission critical programs while demonstrating fiscal responsibility 
to the Nation’s taxpayers, which is in adherence to the President’s directive to 
make every taxpayer dollar stretch as far as possible.   
 
The Department’s leadership team remains steadfast in accomplishing our strategic 
initiatives and core competencies:  accelerating American leadership; enhancing 
job creation; strengthening U.S. and National Security; fulfilling Constitutional 
requirements and supporting economic activity; and delivering customer-centric 
service excellence. 
1 
 
In addition, the Department will continue investment and job creation; preparing 
for and executing a successful 2020 Decennial Census; bolstering trade 
enforcement and export controls to combat unfair trade practices; supporting 
research and development in cutting edge technologies; and providing the 
observational infrastructure and personnel to develop timely and accurate weather 
forecasts.   
 
All of the various missions the Department undertakes to benefit the Nation’s 
taxpayers are important.  However, with finite resources difficult trade-offs have to 
be made.  In order to preserve our core missions, significant reductions and 
eliminations are recommended.  These are primarily in areas of lower priority 
where we believe another State, local, or private-sector entity can better provide 
these services or administrative functions.  
 
Conducting a Complete and Accurate Decennial Census 
 
The Budget provides $6.1 billion, an increase of more than $2.3 billion from the 
FY 2019 enacted level, for the U.S. Census Bureau operations.  The Budget 
supports the execution of the 2020 Census at $6.4 billion in FY 2020 through a 
combination of $5.3 billion in new appropriations and over $1 billion in available 
balances that were appropriated in prior years.   
 
The decennial census is a constitutional requirement and the Department’s highest 
priority in 2020.  This funding will support the Census Bureau launching of major 
efforts to count all the residents of the United States, including self-response 
operations that will begin in March 2020 with internet, telephone, and paper 
options available for the entire populace.  
 
In 2020, the systems and operations that form the backbone of the most automated 
and high-tech decennial census in history will be reaching the final phases of 
integration, testing, and security checks before being deployed in the field.  The 
field offices and other nationwide field infrastructure will be opened and 
operational, and intense nationwide recruitment and onboarding of hundreds of 
thousands of field staff will be well underway.  
 
The advertising campaign and the partnership program will be operating at peak 
intensity to get the word out about the census and help maximize self-response to 
minimize the far costlier in-person visits to non-responding households.  These 
operations are essential to conducting a modern, efficient, and accurate 2020 
decennial census.  
2 
 
An accurate decennial census is imperative because of the important role this data 
plays in shaping the political landscape and informing the policy-making process. 
Most importantly, the decennial census underpins the apportionment of seats in the 
House of Representatives allocated to the states.  
 
In addition, census data is used by governmental entities at the state and local 
levels for defining the representative boundaries for congressional districts, state 
legislative districts, school districts, and voting precincts, and in the annual 
distribution of over $675 billion of federal funds by various departments and 
agencies.  
 
Combating Unfair Trade Practices 
 
To support the Administration’s aggressive approach to a global market that allows 
U.S. businesses to compete fairly, the Budget provides $460 million for the 
International Trade Administration (ITA).  The Budget will help ITA's 
enforcement and compliance program level the playing field for U.S. business by 
establishing a dedicated team to investigate allegations of circumvention and duty 
evasion following antidumping and countervailing duty investigations. 
 
The Budget supports the modernization of the Committee on Foreign Investment in 
the United States (CFIUS) to implement the Foreign Investment Risk Review 
Modernization Act (FIRRMA).  The Budget adds $2.9 million for ITA to 
implement FIRRMA and $3.3 million to increase the core competencies and 
sectoral expertise within the Industry and Analysis business unit. These 
investments will increase the analytical skills and sectoral intelligence available to 
senior leadership when considering complex trade issues, including cases under the 
new CFIUS regime. 
 
The Budget supports conducting necessary additional investigations under Section 
232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, including $3.0 million within ITA for 
ongoing support of the current, and any future, efforts to process requests for 
exclusion from tariffs imposed under Section 232.   
 
The FY 2020 Budget also supports $127 million for the Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS).  This funding will augment the bureau’s efforts to curtail illegal 
exports of sensitive products and technologies while facilitating secure trade with 
U.S. allies and close partners.  
 
3 
 
It provides $2.5 million for BIS’s role in the implementation of the Export Control 
Reform Act of 2018, including for carrying out expanded enforcement 
responsibilities, and $1.5 million for BIS’s role in the implementation of FIRRMA.  
 
Sustaining Satellites and Vessels 
 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) FY 2020 
Budget of $4.5 billion prioritizes core government functions that promote national 
security and public safety and foster economic opportunity.  
 
This Budget supports the necessary activities of sustaining current weather 
satellites to provide vital forecast information for significant weather events and 
supporting ongoing vessel and aircraft fleet recapitalization efforts.  This budget 
supports the continued development of the NOAA satellite Geostationary and 
Polar constellations that provide vital forecast information for significant weather 
events.  
 
As part of NOAA’s FY 2020 request, the Budget provides $755 million for 
NOAA’s combined Polar Weather Satellites, allowing for a combined program 
with more efficient management and lower overall program cost while providing 
resources necessary to ensure continuity in the Polar orbit.   
 
It also provides $304 million for continued development of the Geostationary 
Operational Environmental Satellites-R series program, ensuring constellation 
continuity in the Geostationary orbit.  Additionally, this budget includes several 
new initiatives that support the development of NOAA’s future satellite 
capabilities, as well as positioning NOAA to take advantage of opportunities to 
procure observational data from commercial vendors.  
 
Finally, this NOAA Budget supports: maintaining National Weather Service 
forecasting capabilities while promoting efficient and effective operations; 
continuing to rebuild fisheries and promote aquaculture development; 
recapitalizing the NOAA fleet to continue at-sea data collection; and fostering safe 
and efficient marine and coastal navigation.  
 
Helping American Businesses Prosper 
 
The Budget includes $108 million to support the Bureau of Economic Analysis 
(BEA) fulfilling its mission to preserve the timeliness, relevance and accuracy of 
4 
 
the many key economic indicators and related data that it produces in an objective 
and cost-effective manner.  
 
In 2020, BEA will produce annual gross domestic product statistics for the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico pursuant to recommendations from the 
Congressional Task Force on Economic Growth in Puerto Rico. BEA will also 
assist in the development of a data service framework, as called for in the 
Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 and in alignment with 
the Federal Data Strategy, focused on modernizing data collection, analysis and 
dissemination.  BEA will partner with Census to leverage data through support 
research.  
 
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) seeks authority to spend 
fee collections of $3.451 billion.  The USPTO continues to fulfill its mission by 
fully supporting the strategic and management priorities of issuing reliable and 
predictable intellectual property (IP) rights; shortening patent application 
pendency; enhancing patent administrative appeal and post-grant processes; fine 
tuning trademark operations; conducting outreach, education and engagement both 
domestically and internationally; promoting and protecting patent and trademark IP 
rights; and investing in information technology stabilization and modernization. 
 
Minority-owned businesses face unique challenges in obtaining the capital and 
support necessary to start and operate businesses.  The Minority Business 
Development Agency (MBDA) is solely dedicated to addressing these challenges 
and helping minority businesses thrive.   
 
To further this mission, the Budget proposes $10 million to refocus the operations 
of MBDA as a policy office that is positioned to advocate for minority businesses 
across all federal programs.  The fiscal year 2020 will begin the drawdown of 
business centers operations in six regions, as they are duplicative of programs 
operated by other federal agencies. 
 
Supporting Research and Development of Critical Technologies 
 
With a request of $688 million, the FY 2020 Budget supports the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) mission to promote U.S. innovation and 
industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and 
technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.  
 
5 
 
These programs encompass advanced manufacturing and material measurements; 
quantum science, engineering, and metrology; and artificial intelligence. FY 2020 
funding also enables NIST to improve cybersecurity and privacy and includes 
support for the Manufacturing USA initiative and the National Institute for 
Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals.  
 
While the Budget reduces overall research funding compared to the FY 2019 
enacted, it includes targeted increases for quantum science to prioritize efforts to 
establish and support an industry consortium to accelerate quantum-related 
research and applications and an increase for artificial intelligence (AI) to expand 
ongoing research and metrology efforts to promote the adoption of AI technologies 
into the marketplace.  
 
The Budget continues to support the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration (NTIA) in representing the United States’ interests at 
multi-stakeholder forums on Internet governance and digital commerce with a $42 
million request.  The Budget supports the commercial sector’s development of 
next-generation wireless services, including 5G and the Internet of Things, by 
funding NTIA’s mission of evaluating and ensuring the most efficient use of 
spectrum resources by government users.  Ensuring adequate access to scarce 
spectrum resources by both the commercial and government sectors is a crucial 
factor for economic growth and national security.  
 
Advancing American Leadership in Commercial Space  
 
The FY 2020 Budget provides $10 million for the recently elevated Office of 
Space Commerce that enables the Department to provide leadership in advancing 
the Administration’s ambitious agenda to promote the United States as the flag of 
choice for commercial space operations.  This is essential to technological 
innovation, economic growth, jobs, national security, and rejuvenating the 
American passion for space exploration.  
 
Eliminating Duplicative Programs, Cutting Red Tape, and Improving Operations 
 
The Budget supports the orderly closure of the Economic Development 
Administration (EDA), which provides small grants with limited impacts and is an 
example of fragmentation and overlap that can exist between federal economic 
development programs, such as rural utilities service grants at the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture and formula grants to states from the Department of Transportation. 
6 
 
By eliminating EDA, the Budget saves approximately $274 million from the FY 
2019 enacted level.  
 
The Budget also eliminates federal funding for the Manufacturing Extension 
Partnership (MEP) program within NIST, which subsidizes up to half the cost of 
state centers that provide consulting services to small- and medium-sized 
manufacturers.  This proposal saves $140 million from the FY 2019 enacted level 
and directs MEP centers to transition solely to non-federal revenue sources as 
originally intended when the program was established.  The Budget includes wind-
down costs associated with these closures.  
 
In addition to the eliminations outlined above, the Department will further cut red 
tape and streamline programs by reorganizing Census, the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, and BEA, in accordance with the Government Reform Plan and 
President’s Management Agenda.  
 
Finally, the Budget includes investments that will begin the implementation of 
modern capabilities to support administrative management systems (financial 
management, acquisitions, property), enterprise data warehouse and business 
intelligence reporting solutions across Commerce. 
 
Conclusion 
 
We look forward to working with this Committee and the rest of the Congress to 
achieve our shared goals on behalf of the American people.  We appreciate your 
consideration of our FY 2020 budget request and look forward to further dialogue 
on how best to benefit American families by strengthening our Nation's economy 
and promoting public safety. 
 
On behalf of Secretary Wilbur Ross and Deputy Secretary Karen Dunn Kelley, we 
are happy to answer any questions that you have about the Department’s FY 2020 
Budget.

For release only by the 
Senate Committee 
on Appropriations 
 
Statement by 
Scott Gottlieb, M.D. 
Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Food and Drug Administration 
Before the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies 
Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate 
 
Good morning Chairman Hoeven, Ranking Member Merkley, and Members of the 
Subcommittee.  Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the 
President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget request for FDA.  
First, I would like to thank the Subcommittee for your continued support of the Agency.  
FDA has received strong bipartisan support throughout the appropriations process in recent years 
and FY 2019 was no different.  I believe this support reflects our shared commitment to the vital 
role FDA has protecting and promoting the public health.  The funding this Subcommittee 
provides is essential to the Agency fulfilling its mission.  The professional staff of FDA is 
grateful for your support of their work and the funding increases the Subcommittee provided 
FDA in FY 2019.   
Last year, FDA accomplished a broad array of scientific advances and regulatory actions 
across our broad portfolio. Our work included promoting generic drug entry as a way to foster 
drug competition and lower drug prices through the implementation of the Drug Competition 
Action Plan, a record-setting year for approvals of novel medical devices and advanced several 
meaningful initiatives to continue enhancing the safety of medical devices.  The Agency also 
continued advancing food safety and nutrition, launching our Nutrition Innovation Strategy to 
leverage nutrition as a tool to reduce the burden of chronic disease, and we took steps to 
empower consumers with nutrition information by supporting retail food establishments in 
meeting menu labeling requirements.  We also furthered implementation of the Food Safety 
Modernization Act (FSMA) which builds proactive safety approaches into the production of 
human and animal foods.  With your continued support, we have more opportunity to deliver on 
the promises of promoting the health of the public we serve.   
The funding requested in the President’s FY 2020 Budget will allow the Agency to 
sustain its current work—protecting the safety of the food and medical products consumers use 
every day—and build on these efforts by requesting additional resources to make significant 
 
 
 
progress on several important fronts; including fostering innovation and competition to bring 
better and more affordable products to market, promoting the development of innovative medical 
products, combatting the opioid epidemic, modernizing food safety and strengthening foodborne 
illness response, and implementing the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures).    
Overall, the Budget requests $6.1 billion in total resources for FDA—which is an 
increase of $643 million or 12 percent above the FY 2019 Annualized Continuing Resolution 
(CR).  At this total level, the Budget includes an increase of $362 million in budget authority and 
an increase of $281 million in user fees.  The Budget requests considerable new resources for 
FDA and makes significant new investments in advancing critical areas of science, technology, 
and public health.  
As the regulatory Agency responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of more 
than $2.5 trillion worth of products used by consumers, I remain steadfast that these funds are 
critical investments in our public health agency.  
I.  Efforts to Advance Safe and Effective Medical Products  
The FY 2020 Budget request for medical product safety is $3.8 billion, an increase of 
$428 million above the FY 2019 Annualized CR, which includes increases of $316 million in 
budget authority and $112 million in user fees. A few examples of the new medical product 
initiatives this Budget request supports are described below.    
A.  Transform Medical Device Safety, Cybersecurity, Review, and Innovation 
FDA has been improving policies and processes to address scientific advances and 
enhance the safety of medical devices.  These improvements are critical to protect patients and 
foster innovation.  FDA’s fragmented information technology systems are not well-suited to 
support these activities.  The Budget requests $55 million for an initiative to build an integrated 
knowledge management system and portal for medical devices to enable safety issues to be 
monitored, and effectiveness to be evaluated, across the total life cycle of the device and to build 
out our digital health program.  These capabilities will better leverage pre-existing and new data 
in near real time.  This modernization effort is essential for implementing FDA’s new 
approaches for digital health technologies, breakthrough devices, use of real-world evidence and 
medical device cybersecurity. 
 
 
2 
 
 
 
B.  Medical Countermeasures 
FDA works with partners at all levels of government—local, state, territorial, tribal, 
federal, and international—to support medical-countermeasure-related public health 
preparedness and response efforts.  This includes working closely with federal partners through 
the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise to build and sustain the 
medical countermeasures programs necessary to respond effectively to chemical, biological, 
radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats and emerging public health threats, such as pandemic 
influenza, as well as with the Department of Defense to support the development of medical 
products needed to protect American military personnel.  In FY 2018, FDA approved 28 medical 
countermeasures, including the first drug with an indication for treatment of smallpox.  
The Budget includes $128 million for medical countermeasure activities, of which $31.5 
million is for the Medical Countermeasure Initiative, an increase of $7 million above the FY 
2019 Annualized CR level.  This investment will increase FDA capacity to facilitate the 
development and availability of medical countermeasures to respond to CBRN and emerging 
infectious disease threats by furthering the establishment of clear, scientifically supported 
regulatory pathways for medical countermeasures, filling critical scientific gaps, and advancing 
platform and manufacturing technologies for medical countermeasures.  
C.  Integrated Pathogen Reduction of the Blood Supply 
Advancing the continued safety of U.S. blood supply through new safety innovations is a 
critical public health priority for FDA.  The Agency currently works to prevent transmitted 
infections through a combination of blood donor screening and laboratory testing methods.  
Pathogen reduction technologies, however, are a potentially more efficient method of decreasing 
the risks posed by viral and other pathogens that may be found in blood.  These technologies are 
currently available for platelets and plasma, but with this new funding, FDA would work to 
promote innovation and expand their use to improve the protection of our blood supply.   
The Budget requests $20 million to pilot this technology as a tool that could help reduce 
the risk of transmission of contaminating viruses and other microorganisms from Whole Blood 
and still allow its subsequent separation into various blood components.  This pathogen reduction 
technology could eventually help protect the blood supply from existing and emerging pathogens 
and, if successful, could potentially reduce or eliminate certain existing blood donor screening 
and testing requirements.  It is possible that if this technology were incorporated broadly, it could 
3 
 
 
 
enhance national security by enabling a blood supply that would be safe in the face of a wide 
variety of emerging pathogens.  It may also deliver these protections for a potentially lower cost 
than those associated with current screening and testing methods. 
D.  Compounding 
FDA’s compounding program—including implementation of the Drug Quality and 
Security Act—is a priority for the Agency. We understand that compounded products serve a 
critical role for many patients across the country and we are committed to develop new policies 
for outsourcing facilities, including policies to improve the quality of outsourcing facilities’ 
compounded products.  We are also helping address providers’ needs for supplies of non-patient-
specific compounded medications (office stock).  For example, with the new resources provided 
by Congress in FY 2019, we plan to establish a Compounding Center of Excellence to provide 
training on good manufacturing practices for outsourcing facilities and develop a specialized 
group of investigators who would focus on outsourcing facility inspectional activities.  By 
engaging with outsourcing facilities and states, we can help the domestic outsourcing facility 
adhere to the quality standards needed to protect patient health and support sector growth. 
The Budget builds on our efforts and requests $76 million to support compounding 
activities.  Of this total, $14 million will be used to catalyze the development of policies and 
regulations for the outsourcing facilities, including advancement of the list of bulk drug 
substances that outsourcing facilities may use in compounding and current good manufacturing 
practice guidance and regulation specific to outsourcing facilities.  The activities supported by 
this funding would give outsourcing facilities tools to better meet healthcare providers’ and 
patients’ needs for compounded drugs.  
II.    Efforts to Advance Food Safety  
The FY 2020 Budget request for food safety is $1.4 billion, an increase of 
$67 million above the FY 2019 Annualized CR, which includes an increase of $38 million in 
budget authority and $29 million in user fees.  A few highlights of the Budget request are 
described below.    
A.  Advancing FSMA 
As part of our ongoing implementation efforts related to FSMA, the Budget proposes 
allocating an increase of $16 million above the FY 2019 Annualized CR level to provide 
inspections through the state cooperative agreement programs.  These additional resources are 
4 
 
 
 
essential to the successful implementation of FSMA and are key to protecting public health by 
ensuring that manufacturing and processing facilities comply with the new FSMA requirements.   
B.  Strengthening Response Capabilities for Foodborne Outbreaks 
Efficient global markets for food production and distribution allow American families 
access to a wide range of wholesome and affordable food choices that can improve their health.  
We want to provide Americans the benefits from access to a highly diverse food supply, while 
reducing risks from foodborne illnesses. 
In order to strengthen our response capabilities to foodborne disease outbreaks by 
improving our capacity to detect early signals associated with foodborne illness and shortening 
response timelines once human or animal food contamination is detected, the Budget requests an 
increase of $16 million above the FY 2019 Annualized CR level.  In FY 2017 and FY 2018, 
FDA’s Coordinated Outbreak Response and Evaluation network evaluated nearly 120 potential 
human food safety outbreak incidents per year.  That is nearly double what was reviewed in FY 
2015 and FY 2016.  The increase requested in the Budget will allow the Agency to add new staff 
and resources to enhance signal detection, response to outbreaks, and post-response evaluations.  
FDA will also add staff to oversee its recall process and make the recall process timelier. 
C.  Promoting Innovation and Emerging Technology While Maintaining Product Safety 
Innovations in plant and animal biotechnology offer tremendous opportunities for 
advancing public health.  Promising new technologies have the potential to improve human and 
animal health, animal well-being, food productivity and food security.  FDA will continue to 
facilitate the safe development of these emerging technologies by investing in continued 
enhancements to our review capabilities for biotechnology products and other novel products, 
assessing these products in a risk-based manner to provide predictable commercialization 
pathways that can foster product innovation and market access in a safe and timely way, and 
improve consumer nutrition.  To these ends, the Budget proposes a new $28 million user fee for 
Innovative Food Products, which FDA intends to develop in collaboration with industry and 
other stakeholders.  The Budget also requests an additional $8 million in budget authority to 
improve review times and eliminate unnecessary burdens to industry related to the premarket 
safety reviews of animal food ingredients. 
 
 
5 
 
 
 
III.  Tobacco  
The Budget requests $100 million in new tobacco fees, and includes manufacturers and 
importers of deemed tobacco products, including electronic nicotine delivery systems, and 
certain other products within the FDA’s tobacco user fee assessments.  E-cigarettes, in particular, 
represent an increasing share of the tobacco marketplace.  The new resources will support the 
FDA in its continued efforts to create a modern regulatory framework for the appropriate 
oversight of e-cigarettes and in taking continued steps to reduce youth use of all tobacco 
products. One of our most important public health efforts is to continue standing up a framework 
to make sure we can put e-cigarettes through an appropriate series of regulatory gates, and 
aggressively confront youth use of these products to make sure children do not become addicted 
to nicotine. 
IV.   Opioids  
 One of my highest priorities as FDA Commissioner is combatting the ongoing crisis of 
opioid addiction.  The FDA has changed its approach to the opioids crisis and is taking a much 
more aggressive approach to regulatory action. At the FDA, we’ve committed to taking more 
rapid action in the face of new threats, like the growing prevalence of illicit fentanyl that’s 
contributing to overdose deaths, or the continued prevalence of prescriptions being written for 
durations of use that are too long for the clinical circumstances for which they’re intended. 
We’ve changed the way we’re tackling these issues and stepped up our intervention when it 
comes to opioids. Going forward, we’re going to be looking at the potential for evaluating the 
comparative benefits and risks of new opioids relative to other opioids already on the market. 
We’ve raised the question of whether there should be such a standard for new opioid approvals 
to offer some advantage over the existing armamentarium. We plan continue to evaluate this 
concept as we work to modernize the FDA’s framework for assessing the risks and benefits of 
opioid drugs. FDA is focusing its efforts in the following four priorities:   
  Decreasing exposure and preventing new addiction, 
  Supporting the treatment of those with opioid use disorder, 
  Fostering the development of novel pain treatment therapies, and 
  Increasing enforcement and assessing benefit-risk. 
The Budget requests an additional $55 million above the FY 2019 Annualized CR level 
to continue supporting the four main areas of the Agency’s work. These funds will continue to 
6 
 
 
 
build on the tremendous financial investments this Subcommittee has provided to the Agency for 
our opioids work over the last two fiscal years.   
V.  21st Century Cures Act 
  Implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures) continues to be a top priority for 
the Agency.  Cures includes provisions that have the potential to impart far-reaching effects on 
scientific advancements in medical product development.  The law complements many efforts 
underway at FDA.  All of these efforts are aimed at transforming the way we support product 
development and maintaining FDA’s gold standard for safety and effectiveness.  Toward these 
efforts, the Budget requests a total of $75 million to support our implementation work. 
VI.   Conclusion 
The last year was historic for the Agency.  We are diligently working on a number of 
fronts and the vital work we do provides Americans with better ways to improve their health and 
welfare, empowering consumers to make informed choices about the products they use and the 
foods they feed to their families.  This Budget will help FDA maintain and complement our 
current efforts, as well as provide a renewed focus and investment in some of the Agency’s and 
the nation’s top public health priorities.  I look forward to answering your questions today and 
the Agency looks forward to working with all of you going forward.

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 
Statement by Betsy DeVos 
Secretary of Education 
on the 
U.S. Department of Education Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Request 
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Murray, and Members of the Subcommittee: 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the President’s Fiscal Year 2020 Budget 
Request for the Department of Education. 
The Department’s mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global 
competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.  We can best 
accomplish this when we come alongside teachers and parents in their efforts to help each 
student pursue the education that works for them.  
This Budget supports this Administration’s commitment to expanding education freedom. 
It maintains funding for key formula grants and makes targeted investments of taxpayer dollars 
in education freedom for school leaders, for teachers, and for students and their families. The 
Budget would also expand the opportunity to use Pell Grants for high-quality, short-term 
training, enhance workforce development and career and technical education, and streamline and 
improve student loan repayment. 
 Elsewhere in the President’s fiscal year 2020 budget, the Administration is proposing a 
Federal tax credit to encourage voluntary contributions, of up to a national cap of $5 billion each 
year, to provide scholarships to elementary and secondary students. I would like to make three 
key points about Education Freedom Scholarships that we hope will help the tax credit win broad 
support in Congress.  
   
Page 1 of 12 
 
  
First, it relies entirely on voluntary contributions to State-identified, non-profit 
organizations that give scholarships to elementary and secondary students. So, the proposal does 
not divert a single penny from public school teachers or public school students. It is merely a 
mechanism to empower families to choose the best educational options for their children.  
Second, it is not a Federal program. States will control the design of their own programs. 
States will determine which students will be eligible, which educational providers can 
participate, how much scholarships should be, and every other detail.  
Finally, the proposal is not just for students who wish to attend private schools. States can 
decide to use scholarships to expand public school options—such as career and technical 
education (CTE), apprenticeships, dual enrollment programs, or transportation to out-of-zone 
schools. We hope States will empower families to choose all options including private education, 
but I am also committed to letting States make their own decisions when it comes to their 
scholarship programs. 
The President’s 2020 Budget also demonstrates fiscal discipline. When it comes to 
domestic discretionary education spending over the past couple of years, Congress has ignored 
the Administration’s recommendations. In fact, Congress has increased the Department’s 
discretionary spending by billions of dollars.  
Since President Trump took office, Congressional appropriations for U.S. Department of 
Education programs have increased dramatically—in spite of the Administration’s call to slow 
spending. We are not doing our children any favors when we borrow from their future in order to 
invest in systems and policies that are not yielding better results.  Overwhelming Federal debt 
may prove to be the single greatest barrier that future generations will face in trying to achieve 
the full potential of the American dream, and we cannot continue to kick that can down the road.  
Page 2 of 12 
 
  
For fiscal year 2017, Congress appropriated a total of $68.2 billion in discretionary funds. For 
fiscal year 2019, Congress appropriated $71.1 billion—an increase of 4.2 percent.  
American taxpayers cannot afford these sorts of increases. What’s more, this 
Administration dispenses with the tired notion that more spending equals better results in 
education. For years, American taxpayers have been asked to send bigger portions of their 
paychecks to the Government, which promises more money will cure what ails education. But 
too many students are still left unprepared. So, the President’s fiscal year 2020 Budget includes 
$64.0 billion in new discretionary budget authority, a reduction of $7.1 billion from the fiscal 
year 2019 appropriated level, or a 10 percent decrease.  
American taxpayers have other reasons to be concerned about education spending. 
Postsecondary education discretionary and mandatory funding would make available 
$131 billion in new taxpayer-financed student aid to postsecondary students this year, with 
$100 billion of that total in new student loans, adding to the almost $1.5 trillion in the Federal 
student loan portfolio. Federal Student Aid’s loan portfolio is the largest consumer loan portfolio 
in America—larger than that of J.P. Morgan and Bank of America. And 43 percent of those 
student loans are in default, more than 30-days delinquent, or negatively amortized. Another 
20 percent of loans are in forbearance or deferment. Only 24 percent of all loans are being 
reduced by at least one dollar in principal, which means the rest of them are growing in size 
rather than shrinking, even if borrowers are meeting the terms of their repayment plan and all 
legal obligations. American students need to understand that they are digging themselves into a 
deep financial hole and taxpayers deserve fiscal restraint because they are the ones that could 
ultimately be left holding the bag. That is why the Budget proposes crucial student loan reforms 
which I will discuss in more detail below. 
Page 3 of 12 
 
  
ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION 
In the area of elementary and secondary education, the Budget request reflects our 
continued commitment to providing States and those closest to students with the resources and 
flexibility to ensure that students facing the greatest challenges can pursue a great education. In 
particular, we have protected funding for the key formula grant programs that support America’s 
most vulnerable children. To supplement State and local efforts to support nearly 25 million low-
income children, the Budget proposes $15.9 billion for the Title I program—the same level as 
the fiscal year 2019 appropriation. And to help support local efforts to serve nearly 7 million 
students with disabilities, the Budget proposes $13.2 billion for Grants to States under IDEA. 
That’s the same level as the fiscal year 2019 appropriation.  
This Budget builds on our efforts to give families more freedom, so that families can find 
the best educational setting for their children. It contains more than $650 million to support 
public school choice, including $500 million for opening and expanding high-quality, public 
charter schools and for helping finance charter school facilities; $107 million for public magnet 
schools; and $50 million for districts that participate in a student-centered funding pilot that will 
help districts transition to transparent funding systems where school funding is based on student 
needs and money follows children to their schools.  
The Budget also includes new investments to empower teachers and elevate the teaching 
profession. Specifically, we are proposing a $200 million demonstration project under the 
Education Innovation and Research program that would provide individual professional-
development stipends, or teacher vouchers. These would replace district-driven, one-size-fits-all 
professional development activities with those that empower teachers to select training 
opportunities tailored to their individual needs and those of the students they are serving. In 
Page 4 of 12 
 
  
several conversations and roundtables I’ve recently hosted, teachers consistently criticize the 
quality of the professional development programs they are forced to attend. These stipends will 
free teachers to study and learn what they know will most benefit themselves and their 
students—not what’s dictated to them from the district office. 
The request also includes $200 million for the Teacher and School Leader (TSL) 
Incentive grant program to support a new competition focused primarily on the expansion of 
quality teacher mentoring and residency programs. Many of the classroom teachers I’ve met 
have spoken with great passion about the important role that high-quality mentors and 
residencies have played in helping them improve their knowledge and skill and become excellent 
instructors. Those who weren’t so lucky describe how ill prepared they were for the classroom. 
We want to test whether good mentors and residency programs can cost-effectively improve both 
teacher induction and retention while creating compensated leadership opportunities for teacher 
mentors so that they choose to stay in the classroom, where their talents are most needed. The 
proposed fiscal year 2020 TSL competition also would test the impact of increased compensation 
on recruitment and retention of effective educators in high-need subjects such as STEM and 
computer science. 
This Administration is committed to ensuring that students are able to learn in safe and 
secure educational environments. The Budget includes approximately $700 million, an increase 
of nearly $200 million compared to 2019 appropriation levels, for grant programs in the 
Departments of Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services, to give States and school 
districts resources they need should they choose to implement the recommendations of the 
Federal Commission on School Safety, which I co-chaired. At the Department of Education, we 
are proposing a $100 million School Safety State Grant program that would help build State and 
Page 5 of 12 
 
  
local capacity to identify and address the wide range of school safety and student health concerns 
authorized under Title IV-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).  Our 
request also would maintain support for other school safety programs such as School Climate 
Transformation Grants, Project Prevent Grants, and Mental Health Demonstration Grants.  
To protect formula grants and to target our investments on key priorities, the 
Administration reduced or eliminated funding for several programs. We recognize that taxpayer 
funds aren’t unlimited, and that means making some tough but necessary choices.  We know that 
every program has a constituency that is impassioned about its importance, but as American 
families well understand, in order to stick with the budget, tough choices must be made and even 
beloved traditions must be abandoned in order to remain solvent. 
First, the Budget does not include funding for the Supporting Effective Instruction State 
Grants authorized in Title II-A of the ESEA, saving $2.1 billion compared to the fiscal year 2019 
appropriation. States and local districts have primarily used these funds for teacher professional 
development and class-size reduction. The Administration believes such activities are better 
funded through State and local resources, and they could be funded through other Federal grants, 
including Title I of the ESEA. There is no evidence that the Federal taxpayer investments in 
existing professional development programs or class-size reduction have meaningfully improved 
student outcomes.  In fact, students may be better served by being in larger classes, if by hiring 
fewer teachers, a district or state can better compensate those who have demonstrated high 
ability and outstanding results. 
Second, the Budget does not include funding for Title IV-A’s Student Support and 
Academic Enrichment Grants, saving $1.2 billion compared to the fiscal year 2019 
appropriation. These flexible funds are typically used by States and districts to enrich student 
Page 6 of 12 
 
  
academic programs, improve school environments, and deploy education technology. Title IV-A 
is neither well-structured nor sufficiently targeted, leading to most districts receiving less than 
$30,000, too little money to have an impact. Title IV-A activities should be, and largely are, 
funded through State and local resources, as well as other Federal programs, including Title I 
grants.  
Third, the Budget does not include funding for 21st Century Community Learning 
Centers, saving $1.2 billion compared to the fiscal year 2019 appropriation. Although before- 
and after-school programs can improve student outcomes, 21st Century Community Learning 
Center programs do not generate consistent student attendance or yield consistently improved 
academic outcomes. The Administration believes it would be more effective to have local, State, 
and private resources support activities that are designed to meet the unique needs of each 
community, as well as the needs of its students and parents. 
CAREER PATHWAYS AND POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION 
The fiscal year 2020 Budget supports students in continuing their lifelong learning 
journeys by investing in career and technical education, promoting multiple pathways to 
successful careers, and streamlining and improving Federal student aid programs. The Budget 
also continues support for Federal programs that help prepare low-income and minority students 
for postsecondary education and strengthen postsecondary institutions serving large proportions 
of minority students. These proposals support recent congressional efforts to modernize and 
reauthorize the Higher Education Act to be responsive to the needs of both students and 
employers.   
The Budget includes $1.3 billion for Career and Technical Education State grants, which 
help ensure that students have access to CTE opportunities in high school as well as a wide array 
Page 7 of 12 
 
  
of postsecondary options including certificate programs, applied associate degree programs, and 
apprenticeships. The Budget also includes $20 million for CTE National activities to help 
students enter careers in STEM and information technology-related programs, such as advanced 
manufacturing, biotechnology, engineering technology, allied health, and mechanics. 
Additionally, the Budget proposes to double the American Competitiveness and Workforce 
Improvement Act fee for the H-1B program and direct 15 percent of the revenues to the CTE 
State Grants.  The Budget includes $60 million under Adult Education National Leadership 
Activities to support State efforts to create pre-apprenticeship programs that increase the number 
of adults who are able to meet the basic entrance requirements of apprenticeship programs.  We 
have heard from too many employers that they want to provide apprenticeship opportunities, but 
cannot find interested participants who have the underlying math, science, and reading skills they 
need to succeed. 
There are many paths to successful careers, and Federal student aid programs should be 
flexible enough to support students on the path of their choice. The Budget would expand Pell 
Grant eligibility to include high-quality short-term programs, helping more Americans access 
education programs that can prepare them for well-paying jobs in high-demand fields more 
quickly than traditional degree programs.  We should give students access to a credential that 
saves them money and gets them into the workforce more quickly, so they can enjoy the many 
rewards associated with performing meaningful work and making a valued contribution. 
The 2020 Budget would also reform campus-based aid programs by focusing limited 
resources on bolstering effective workforce development opportunities for students with the most 
need. The Budget proposes to reform the Federal Work-Study program to support workforce and 
career-oriented education opportunities for low-income undergraduate students, rather than 
Page 8 of 12 
 
  
subsidizing on-campus employment, so that low-income students are engaged in work 
experiences while in school that will lead to higher-paying jobs when they graduate.  Our 
proposal also ends the system that diverts the largest portion of campus-based aid to the 
institutions that need it least and serve the fewest high-risk, high-need students.  Our proposal 
would focus scarce funds on institutions enrolling high numbers of Pell Grant recipients, rather 
than their historical participation in the program. We can no longer tolerate a system that allows 
advantaged students to enjoy the prized summer internships while low-income students are 
limited to retail, grounds keeping, office, or food service jobs on campus that likely won’t 
improve their longer term employability.   
The 2020 Budget would also save $840 million in fiscal year 2020 by eliminating the 
Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (SEOG) program, which currently allows 
institutions to provide grant aid to students that do not always have the greatest need for 
assistance and that provides disproportionate benefits to students already advantaged by 
attending more selective institutions. 
Importantly, the Budget proposes to improve student loan repayment by consolidating 
multiple Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans into a single plan. The numerous IDR options 
currently offered to borrowers overly complicate choosing and enrolling in the right repayment 
plan, and provide disproportionate benefit to students who complete expensive graduate 
education, but are more likely to enjoy higher earning potential over their lifetime. The proposed 
single IDR plan would cap a borrower’s monthly payment at 12.5 percent of discretionary 
income. For undergraduate borrowers, any balance remaining after 15 years of repayment would 
be forgiven. For borrowers with graduate debt, any balance remaining after 30 years of 
repayment would be forgiven. The Budget also proposes auto-enrollment for severely delinquent 
Page 9 of 12 
 
  
borrowers and institutes a process for borrowers to consent to share income data for multiple 
years to reduce the burden on an individual borrower to submit forms and proof of earnings. To 
facilitate these improvements and to reduce improper payments, the Budget proposes to 
streamline the Department’s ability to verify applicants’ income data held by the Internal 
Revenue Service.  This improvement would also make it easier for students to complete their 
FAFSA application and would reduce the added burden to institutions when they are asked to 
provide additional verification of student eligibility. 
To further simplify the student loan program and take the Government out of picking 
winners and losers among students who may have the same debt and earn the same salary—
simply because their employers have a different tax status or their parents had different 
earnings—the fiscal year 2020 Budget proposes eliminating Public Service Loan Forgiveness 
(PSLF) and Subsidized Stafford Loans for new borrowers. The PSLF program is not only 
complicated for borrowers to navigate, partly because of how the program was designed when it 
began in 2007, but it also uses Government resources to encourage students to take jobs based on 
the tax-status of their employer, rather than on a student’s unique talents or local workforce 
needs.  
The Budget also discontinues the subsidized loan program, as it provides an after-the-fact 
benefit that doesn’t help students complete their programs and does not take into account 
borrower earnings in their chosen professions. It sends the wrong message to suggest to students 
that just because their parents were low-income, they will be too.  The President’s Budget 
proposes to support all borrowers pursuing any career by streamlining multiple IDR plans into a 
single IDR plan which will allow borrowers to make affordable monthly payments based on their 
income.

In order to effectively implement the student aid programs, we are pursuing an innovative 
strategy to deliver Federal student aid services and information to our customers, and the Budget 
includes strong support for this initiative.  Next Gen FSA, will create an improved, world-class 
customer experience for FSA's millions of customers, while creating a more agile, flexible model 
that will streamline FSA's existing operations.  The key to the Next Gen FSA transformation will 
be a comprehensive, FSA-branded customer engagement layer that will create an environment 
where the Department’s customers will receive clear, consistent information and readily 
accessible self-service options at every stage of the student aid lifecycle, something I think we 
can all agree is worth supporting. 
The Budget proposes to restructure and streamline college preparation programs by 
transitioning a number of the Federal TRIO Programs into a $950 million State formula grant 
program and eliminating GEAR UP, which currently supports activities that could be supported 
under the proposed TRIO State formula grant program. These grants would support evidence-
based postsecondary preparation programs designed to help low-income students progress 
through the pipeline from middle school through postsecondary education, and give more 
flexibility to States to design activities that meet the unique needs of their students.  It also 
reduces wasteful spending by institutions on writing elaborate proposals and by the Department 
on hosting large proposal review panels—money that would be better spent on students than 
review panels.   
The Budget also supports important investments in improving the academic quality, 
institutional management and capacity, infrastructure and student support services of Minority 
Serving Institutions (MSIs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  
Specifically, the Budget proposes to create efficiencies and reduce the cost of applying for grants 
Page 11 of 12 
 
  
by consolidating six MSI programs into a $148 million formula grant program, which will 
provide funds the institutions can rely on for longer-term investments and to implement best 
practices proven effective by others.  In recognition of the extraordinary historic contribution 
provided by HBCUs, the Budget includes $626 million for programs that provide funding to help 
these institutions strengthen their capacity to provide the highest quality education. 
Finally, the Budget eliminates funding for many discretionary programs that do not 
address national needs, duplicate other programs, are ineffective, or are more appropriately 
supported with State, local, or private funds—saving the taxpayer $6.7 billion. 
The Budget reflects our commitment to spending taxpayer dollars wisely and efficiently 
while supporting our Nation’s students of all ages. Because that’s who budgets are for—students. 
If this country is to remain secure, strong, prosperous, and free, we need students who are 
prepared to pursue successful careers and lead meaningful lives.  The Government must resist 
the urge to pick winners and losers among students, institutions, and occupations.  Instead, we 
must encourage and enable every student to be their best self and live their best life. 
Thank you for this opportunity to testify. I will be happy to respond to any questions you 
may have.

TESTIMONY OF 
ADMIRAL KARL L. SCHULTZ 
COMMANDANT, U.S. COAST GUARD 
 
ON  
“THE COAST GUARD’S FISCAL YEAR 2020 BUDGET REQUEST” 
 
BEFORE THE 
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY 
 
MARCH 28, 2019 
 
Introduction  
 
Madam Chairwoman and distinguished members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity 
to testify today.  Thank you for your enduring support of the United States Coast Guard, 
particularly the significant investments provided in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Consolidated 
Appropriations Act.  
 
Your Coast Guard is on the front lines of our Nation’s effort to protect the American people, our 
homeland, and our way of life.  As threats and challenges to our national security and global 
influence grow more complex, the need for a Ready, Relevant, and Responsive Coast Guard has 
never been greater. 
 
Appropriately positioned within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Coast 
Guard is a federal law enforcement agency, a regulatory body, a first responder, a member of the 
U.S. Intelligence Community, and a military service and a branch of the Armed Forces of the 
United States at all times1– The Coast Guard offers specialized and unique capabilities across the 
full spectrum of maritime activities, from security cooperation up to armed conflict.   
 
The Coast Guard has matured and evolved over the course of our 228-year history, adapting our 
people, assets, and capabilities in response to emerging national demands and international 
challenges.  We are locally based, nationally responsive, and globally impactful. 
 
To outline my vision for the Service, I recently released the U.S. Coast Guard Strategic Plan 2018-
2022. To that end, my highest priority is to “Maximize Readiness Today and Tomorrow,” and 
readiness starts with our people, who are our greatest strength.  In the competitive marketplace the 
Armed Forces find ourselves, now is a critical time to invest in our mission-ready total workforce.  
 
My second top priority is continuing to “Address the Nation’s Complex Maritime Challenges” 
through international and domestic leadership in the maritime domain.  A unique instrument of 
national  power,  the  Coast  Guard  offers  the  ability  to  secure  the  maritime  border,  combat 
Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs), and facilitate $4.6 trillion of annual economic 
activity on our Nation’s waterways. 
                                                 
1 14 U.S.C. § 1; 10 U.S.C. § 101 
 
 
Finally, in a competitive budget environment, your Coast Guard is acutely focused on my third 
priority, “Delivering Mission Excellence Anytime, Anywhere,” by continuously challenging 
ourselves to innovate and drive increased efficiency for better organizational performance in 
response to both manmade crises and natural disasters.  
 
Strategic Effects 
 
The Coast Guard plays a critical role in a comprehensive approach to securing our borders – from 
disrupting drug trafficking and illegal immigration in the southern transit zones, to projecting 
sovereignty across the globe.  Our Nation’s maritime borders are vast, and include one of the 
largest systems of ports, waterways, and critical maritime infrastructure in the world, including 
95,000 miles of coastline. 
 
As part of the DHS layered security strategy, the Coast Guard pushes out our Nation’s border, and 
serves as the “offense” in a comprehensive approach to layered border security strategy.  Through 
the interdiction of illicit drugs and the detention of suspected drug smugglers, the Coast Guard 
disrupts TCO networks at sea, over a thousand miles from our shore, where they are most 
vulnerable.  Coast Guard maritime interdictions weaken the TCOs who destabilize our immediate 
neighbor Mexico, the Central American land corridor, and South American countries.  Our 
interdiction efforts minimize corruption and create space for effective governance to exist.  Coast 
Guard interdiction efforts reduce the “push factors” that are responsible for driving migration to 
our Southwest land border. 
 
Working with interagency partners, the Coast Guard seized 209 metric tons of cocaine and 
detained over 600 suspected smugglers in FY 2018, which is more than all other federal agencies 
combined.  Highlighting the capabilities of one of our modern assets, in November 2018, the 
National Security Cutter (NSC) CGC JAMES, in support of Joint Interagency Task Force South 
(JIATF-S), seized nearly nine tons of cocaine and detained over 40 suspected drug smugglers from 
various drug conveyances, including low-profile go-fast vessels and fishing vessels.  In addition 
to stopping these drugs from getting to our streets, the information we gather and share with our 
partners in the Intelligence Community facilitates deeper understanding of TCOs and ultimately 
helps our unified efforts to dismantle them. 
 
As an important part of the modern military’s Joint Force2, we currently have forces assigned to 
each of the six geographic Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), as well as Cyber Command, 
Transportation Command, and Special Operations Command.  The Coast Guard deploys world-
wide to execute our statutory Defense Operations mission in support of national security priorities.  
Typically, on any given day, 11 cutters, 2 maritime patrol aircraft, 5 helicopters, 2 specialized 
boarding teams, and an entire Port Security Unit are supporting Department of Defense (DoD) 
COCOMs on all seven continents.  In the Middle East, our squadron of six patrol boats continues 
to conduct maritime security operations on the waters of the Arabian Gulf in close cooperation 
with the U.S. Navy, promoting regional peace and stability.   
 
 
                                                 
2 In addition to the Coast Guard’s status as an Armed Force (10 U.S.C. § 101), see also Memorandum of Agreement 
Between DoD and DHS on the Use of Coast Guard Capabilities and Resources in Support of the National Military 
Strategy, 02 May 2008, as amended 18 May 2010. 
  2
 
Likewise, as one of the principal federal agencies performing Detection and Monitoring (D&M) 
in the southern maritime transit zone, the Coast Guard provides more than 4,000 hours of maritime 
patrol aircraft support and 2,000 major cutter days to DoD’s Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) 
each year. 
 
Coast Guard authorities and capabilities bridge national security needs between DoD war fighters 
abroad and DHS agencies protecting our homeland.  In addition to COCOM support, the Coast 
Guard partners with federal, state, local, territorial, tribal, private, and international stakeholders 
to address problems across an increasingly complex maritime domain.  Our leadership on global 
maritime  governing  bodies  and  our  collaborative  approach  to  operationalize  international 
agreements drives stability, legitimacy, and order.  We shape how countries conduct maritime law 
enforcement and establish governance. 
 
Looking forward, the performance capabilities and expected capacity of our future Offshore Patrol 
Cutter (OPC) fleet will provide the tools to more effectively enforce federal laws, secure our 
maritime borders, disrupt TCOs, and respond to 21st century threats.  Continued progress on this 
acquisition is vital to recapitalizing our aging fleet of Medium Endurance Cutters (MECs), some 
of which will be over 55 years old when the first OPC is delivered in 2021.  In concert with the 
extended range and capability of the NSC and the enhanced coastal patrol capability of the Fast 
Response Cutter (FRC), our planned program of record for 25 OPCs will be the backbone of the 
Coast Guard’s strategy to project and maintain offshore presence. 
 
In the Arctic region, the Coast Guard remains steadfastly committed to our role as the lead federal 
agency  for  homeland  security,  safety,  and  environmental  stewardship.    There,  we  enhance 
maritime domain awareness, facilitate governance and promote partnerships to meet security and 
safety needs in this geo-strategically and economically vital area.  As access to the region continues 
to expand, strategic competition drives more nations to look to the Arctic for economic and 
geopolitical advantages, and the Coast Guard stands ready to provide the leadership and sustained 
surface presence necessary to protect our rights and sovereignty as an Arctic Nation. 
 
Looking to the Antarctic, the 43-year old CGC POLAR STAR, the Nation’s only operational 
heavy icebreaker, just returned home after successfully completing Operation DEEP FREEZE 
(DF-19), the annual McMurdo Station breakout, though not without overcoming several high-risk 
casualties to the ship’s engineering systems.  The ship’s crew had to battle a fire that left lasting 
damage to electrical systems; ship-wide power outages occurred during ice breaking operations.  
And in the same transit, divers were sent into the icy waters to investigate and repair a propeller 
shaft seal leak.  Events like these reinforce the reality that we are only one major casualty away 
from leaving the Nation without any heavy icebreaking capability. 
 
With increased activity in the maritime reaches and growing competition for resources, we cannot 
wait any longer for increased access and a more persistent presence in the Polar Regions.  Our 
sustained presence there is imperative to ensuring our Nation’s security, asserting our sovereign 
rights, and protecting our long-term economic interests.   
 
Last year, we released a request for proposal (RFP) and later this spring we plan to award a detail 
design and construction (DD&C) contract for the construction of three heavy Polar Security 
Cutters (PSCs).  I am thankful for your support for the $675 million in the FY 2019 appropriation.  
This funding, coupled with the $300 million in Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy (SCN) funding 
in FY 2017 and 2018, is sufficient to fund construction of the first PSC as well as initial long lead 
time material for a second PSC.      
  3
 
 
Our value to the Nation is observed on the farthest shores around the globe as well as closer to 
home where we continue to be “Always Ready” to answer the call for help.  The 2018 hurricane 
season led to yet another historic Coast Guard response effort.  The Coast Guard mobilized over 
8,600 active duty members, reservists, and civilians for hurricane response across the United States 
for hurricanes Florence and Michael in the mid-Atlantic states and Gulf Coast respectively, as well 
as typhoon Mangkhut in Guam.   
 
In support of, and in coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and 
other federal, state, local, and territorial agencies, the Coast Guard saved nearly 1,000 lives using 
helicopters and shallow water craft, provided logistical support to first responders, and oversaw 
the safe and effective resumption of commerce at over 20 impacted sea ports.   
 
While such a level of professionalism and distinction is what the American people have come to 
expect from your Coast Guard, that response comes at a cost.  We continue to do our very best to 
stand ready to respond to all maritime disasters, both natural and manmade; however, these efforts 
consume future readiness.  Our aging assets and infrastructure require increased maintenance and 
repairs, all of which is compounded by the on-going recovery and restoration operations of the 
historic hurricane season of 2017. 
 
In 2017 alone, the Coast Guard lost the equivalent of two major cutters (e.g., over 300 operational 
days) due to unplanned repairs.  Expanding that to the last two years, we have lost three years’ 
worth of major cutter patrol days.  In 2017 and again in 2018, shortages in parts and supplies cost 
the Coast Guard over 4,500 flight hours each year, or the equivalent of programmed operating 
hours for seven MH-65 helicopters.  Each hour lost in the transit zones keeps us further from 
reaching our interdiction targets and helps the TCOs deliver their illicit cargoes. 
 
Service readiness starts with our most valuable asset – our people.  We must continue to recruit, 
train, support, and retain a mission ready total workforce that not only positions the Service to 
excel across the full spectrum of Coast Guard missions, but is representative of the diverse Nation 
we serve.  Our workforce end strength was reduced by over 1,250 personnel during a three-year 
period from FY 2012 to FY 2015.  And compared to the workforce of FY 2012, the Coast Guard 
has nearly 1,000 fewer personnel to accomplish an ever increasing mission set.  Adequate increases 
to depot maintenance funding, coupled with strategic human capital investments, are critical to 
addressing these readiness challenges.  
 
Conclusion   
 
The Coast Guard offers a capability unmatched in the federal government.  Whether combating 
TCOs to help stabilize to the Western Hemisphere, responding to mariners in distress in the Bering 
Sea, or supporting U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) on the Arabian Gulf, the Coast Guard 
stands ready to execute a suite of law enforcement, military, and regulatory authorities and 
capabilities to achieve mission success anytime, anywhere.  We cannot do this on the backs of our 
people –now is the time to address the erosion of readiness experienced in our Service over the 
past decade due to near flat line funding for operations and support..   
 
While the demand for Coast Guard services has never been higher, we must address our lost 
purchasing power, the growing backlogs of deferred maintenance on our capital assets, and the 
degraded habitability of our infrastructure.

Our 48,000 active duty and reserve members, 8,500 civilians, and over 25,000 volunteer members 
of the Coast Guard Auxiliary need your support to maintain a Ready, Relevant, and Responsive 
Coast Guard. 
 
With the continued support of the Administration and Congress, your Coast Guard will live up to 
our motto – Semper Paratus – Always Ready.  Thank you for your support of the men and women 
of the Coast Guard. 
 
 
 
FY 2020 BUDGET REQUEST 
 
The Coast Guard’s FY 2020 Budget request is focused on three main priorities: 
   
1.  Maximize Readiness Today and Tomorrow 
2.  Address the Nation’s Complex Maritime Challenges 
3.  Deliver Mission Excellence Anytime, Anywhere 
 
Maximize Readiness Today and Tomorrow   
 
The Coast Guard’s top priority is Service readiness.  The FY 2020 President’s Budget request 
begins to address the erosion of readiness that resulted from years under the Budget Control Act.  
Critical investments in the workforce as well as depot maintenance for the fleet will put the Service 
on the path to recovery to sustain critical frontline operations. 
 
Additionally,  investments  in  asset  modernization  sustain  recapitalization  momentum  while 
advancing other critical programs.  The FY 2020 Budget request supports the Service’s highest 
priority acquisition, the OPC, and continues recapitalization efforts for cutters, boats, aircraft, IT 
systems, and infrastructure. 
 
Address the Nation’s Complex Maritime Challenges 
 
As one of the Nation’s most unique instruments of national authority across the full spectrum of 
maritime operations, the Coast Guard cooperates and builds capacity to detect, deter, and counter 
maritime threats. 
 
While nefarious activities destabilize and threaten vulnerable regions, the Coast Guard offers 
capabilities, authorities, and established partnerships that lead to a more secure maritime border. 
The FY 2020 Budget invests in a holistic approach to combat TCOs through targeted detection 
and interdiction of suspected drug smugglers, at-sea biometrics, and increased partnerships with 
allied law enforcement nations in Central and South America, to quell illegal migration. 
 
As the Marine Transportation System (MTS) grows increasingly complex, the Coast Guard’s 
marine safety workforce must adapt to continue to facilitate commerce.  The FY 2020 Budget 
increases the marine inspection workforce while addressing key findings from the report on the 
tragic sinking of the freight vessel EL FARO and the loss of 33 crewmembers.  
 
 
 
 
 
  5
 
Deliver Mission Excellence Anytime, Anywhere 
 
The Coast Guard is an agile and adaptive force whose greatest value to the Nation is an ability to 
rapidly shift among its many missions to meet national priorities during steady state and crisis 
operations. 
 
As new threats in the cyber domain emerge, the Coast Guard’s cyber workforce serves as the 
critical link between DoD, DHS, and the Intelligence Community. The FY 2020 Budget increases 
the cyber workforce to promote cyber risk management and protect maritime critical infrastructure 
from attacks, accidents, and disasters.  
 
The Coast Guard seeks to continually improve organizational effectiveness and the FY 2020 
Budget eliminates redundant and outdated IT services to reinforce the culture of continuous 
innovation and enhance information-sharing across the Service. 
 
FY 2020 BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS 
 
Procurement, Construction, & Improvements (PC&I) 
 
Surface Assets: The budget provides $792 million for the following surface asset 
recapitalization and sustainment initiatives: 
 
  National Security Cutter (NSC) – Provides funding for post-delivery activities for the seventh 
through eleventh NSCs, and other program-wide activities.  The acquisition of the NSC is 
vital to performing DHS missions in the far offshore regions around the world.  The NSC 
also provides a robust command and control platform for homeland security and contingency 
operations. 
  Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) – Provides funding for construction of the third ship and long

  7
 
Operations and Support (O&S) 
 
Operation and Maintenance of New Assets: The budget provides $59 million and 297 FTE to 
operate and maintain shore facilities and sustain new cutters, boats, aircraft, and associated 
C4ISR subsystems delivered through acquisition efforts: 
 
  Shore Facilities – Funds operation and maintenance of shore facility projects scheduled for 
completion prior to FY 2020.  Projects include: Coast Guard Yard dry dock facilities in 
Baltimore, Maryland; FRC Homeport Facilities in Galveston, Texas; Electrical Utilities for 
Air Station Barbers Point, Hawaii; and Housing for Station Jonesport, Maine. 
  FRC – Funds operation and maintenance and personnel for five FRCs and shore-side support 
for FRCs in Galveston, Texas; Key West, Florida; and Apra Harbor, Guam. 
  NSC – Funds crew of NSC #9, as well as personnel for sensitive compartmented information 
facility (SCIF) crews and analytical support, and shore-side support personnel in Charleston, 
South Carolina. 
  OPC – Funds a portion of the crew for OPC #1, as well as shore-side personnel to develop 
operational doctrine for the new class of cutter to be homeported in Los Angeles/Long 
Beach, California. 
  HC-130J Aircraft – Funds operations, maintenance, air crews, and pilots for HC-130J 
airframe #12. 
 
Pay & Allowances: The budget provides $118 million to maintain parity with DoD for military 
pay, allowances, and health care, and for civilian benefits and retirement contributions, including 
a 3.1 percent military pay raise in 2020.  As a branch of the Armed Forces of the United States, 
the Coast Guard is subject to the provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act, which 
include pay and personnel benefits for the military workforce. 
 
Asset Decommissionings: The budget saves $12 million and 119 FTE associated with the 
planned decommissioning of one High Endurance Cutter (WHEC) and three 110-foot Patrol 
Boats (WPBs).  As the Coast Guard recapitalizes its cutter and aircraft fleets and brings new 
assets into service, the older assets that are being replaced will be decommissioned: 
 
  High Endurance Cutter (WHEC) – The budget decommissions one WHEC.  These assets are 
being replaced with modernized and more capable NSCs. 
  110-foot Patrol Boats (WPBs) – The budget decommissions three WPBs.  These assets are 
being replaced with modernized and more capable FRCs. 
 
Operational Adjustments: In FY 2020, the Coast Guard will make investments that begin to 
address the erosion of readiness of the Service while investing in new workforce initiatives: 
 
  Aircraft Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Compliance – The budget provides $22 
million to replace obsolete aircraft equipment and systems necessary to comply with FAA 
2020 airspace requirements. 
  Cyber and IT Infrastructure – The budget provides $16 million and 38 FTE to mature the 
cybersecurity defense program.  The budget also provides funding for an information 
technology framework and platform to establish a consolidated user interface primarily for 
Command Centers. 
  Restoring Depot Readiness – The budget provides $10 million to begin to restore eroded 
vessel and aircraft readiness and address critical information technology maintenance and 
inventory backlogs.   
  8
 
  Human Capital and Support Infrastructure – The budget provides $17 million and 22 FTE to 
improve enterprise-wide support for the workforce, including the transition to electronic 
health records and training and support for the Coast Guard Reserve. 
  Counter Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCO) – The budget provides $7 million and 
26 FTE to expand the Coast Guard’s capacity to execute a multi-layered approach in the 
Western Hemisphere maritime transit zone, dismantle TCOs, and secure our Nation’s borders 
from illicit smuggling of all kinds. 
  Maritime Safety, Security, and Commerce – The budget provides $6 million and 20 FTE to 
strengthen the Coast Guard’s marine safety program through improved marine inspector 
training, establishment of a third party oversight and auditing program, expansion of the marine 
inspector workforce, and improved accession opportunities for marine inspectors.

Statement of Carla Hayden 
The Librarian of Congress 
Before the 
Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch 
Committee on Appropriations 
United States Senate 
March 27, 2019 
 
 
 
Madam Chairman, Ranking Member Murphy, and Members of the Subcommittee:  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of the Library’s fiscal 2020 
budget.   
 
Now in my third year as Librarian of Congress, I am encouraged by the advancements we have 
made in sharing more of the Library’s extraordinary collections and our staff’s expertise and 
commitment to public service.  Today, the Library holds nearly 170 million items in all formats 
and languages and has the world’s largest collections of legal materials, films, and sound 
recordings.  Last year, the Library welcomed nearly 1.9 million in-person visitors.  The 
Congressional Research Service (CRS) provided custom services to nearly 100 percent of Senate 
and House member offices and standing committees.   More than 450 thousand claims were 
registered by the U.S. Copyright Office.   Nearly 10 million preservation actions were performed 
on the physical collections; over 20.9 million copies of braille and recorded books and 
magazines were circulated to more than 470,000 blind and physically handicapped accounts; 
and the Library responded to over 1 million reference requests from the Congress, the public, 
and other federal agencies.   The Library’s web sites, including loc.gov, congress.gov, 
copyright.gov, and the CRS site, among others, received 110 million visitors and 503.1 million 
page views.   
 
Over the past year, we have moved forward in significant ways to increase access to the 
Congress’s library.  We created a Digital Strategy Office within the Office of the Chief 
Information Officer to partner with service units to incubate innovative digital projects.  The 
new office has already launched a successful crowdsourcing project, “By the People,” which 
allows public contributions to and interactions with the digital collections in new ways while at 
the same time helping the Library make data more discoverable.  A new, state-of-the-art case 
was installed to conserve and securely display the treasured Gutenberg Bible.  We launched 
crsreports.congress.gov to provide the public with access to non-confidential research products 
produced by CRS for the Congress.  The Law Library digitized 23,522 pages of National 
Transportation Safety Board case findings to be available in fiscal 2019.  New collections have 
been made available online, among them the papers of President Theodore Roosevelt and 
Benjamin Franklin.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the outstanding support that this committee 
and the entire Congress gives to the Library.  In particular, I appreciate the support you have 
provided us for our fiscal 2019 requests to meet high-priority needs such as strengthening CRS 
staffing in high demand areas, restoration of the Copyright examiner workforce, support for the 
increased hosting costs of the Legislative Branch Financial Management System, librarians and 
archivists to address the backlog in processing the special collections, and much more.   
 
Your strong support for staffing resources allows us to better handle critical work and to begin 
replacing specialized staff expertise that was developed over many years and lost -- principally 
to retirement -- and not replaced due to budget limitations.  I also thank you for your continued 
extraordinary support for the Library’s collection storage modules program at Ft. Meade as part 
of the Architect of the Capitol’s budget.  
 
I come before you today to discuss the Library’s funding request for fiscal 2020 which continues 
and expands necessary modernization initiatives to include optimization efforts.  
 
In October, we launched the Fiscal 2019-2023 Strategic Plan with four strategic goals:  Expand 
access, expand services, optimize resources, and measure impact.  Our direction forward calls 
for a decisive shift to become more user centered, digitally enabled, and data driven.  The first 
Digital Strategy, which complements the Fiscal 2019-2023 Strategic Plan, was recently released 
to provide a bold vision to guide the Library’s digital transformation over the next five years. 
 
We completed organizational changes that streamline functions and support the user centered 
direction.  The former National and International Outreach service unit was reconstituted as 
two units, the Center for Learning, Literacy and Engagement and the Center for Exhibits and 
Interpretation, both with dynamic new directors.  Whereas National and International Outreach 
was itself a service unit, the centers are located organizationally under the Office of the 
Librarian so that they are able to pull resources together from across the Library.  The largest 
part of the Library was also realigned to become the Library Collections and Services Group, 
which now includes the Law Library, Library Services, and the National Library for the Blind 
and Physically Handicapped (NLS).  All of these changes directly support public engagement 
with the Library’s resources and services.   
 
With significant congressional support, IT centralization is in its final phase with staff and 
funding transfers from CRS, Copyright, and NLS to the Office of the Chief Information Officer 
(OCIO).  The Copyright Office is aggressively pursuing comprehensive modernization of its IT 
systems.  With a solid, stabilized IT infrastructure close to realization, the Library is 
transitioning through the data center initiative from its restricted legacy hosting facility on 
Capitol Hill to a hybrid hosting infrastructure with enhanced security that is capable of 
accommodating greatly increased digital engagement.   
 
2 
 
 
 
I am confident that we have a strong organizational structure and a robust strategic planning 
process internally in place to lead the Library into the future.  I now ask for your assistance in 
helping us take the additional steps we need with an increase in funding for critical initiatives.  
 
The Library of Congress fiscal 2020 budget request is for approximately $803 million, which 
represents a 6.8 percent increase over the Library’s fiscal 2019 enacted appropriation.  This 
request includes $26 million in mandatory pay and price level increases.  The balance of the 
increase represents critical program investments necessary to fulfill the Library’s role and to 
move forward on the commitment to be more user centered.  
 
The top two goals in the new strategic plan, expanded access and enhanced services, aim to 
make the Library’s unique collections, experts, and services available when, where, and how 
users need them.   
 
Bringing the nation’s collections and history out of the vaults and into public spaces through a 
public/private partnership to create the Visitor Experience remains a key avenue to greater 
access for all who visit.  Over the past year we accelerated our planning for an enhanced visitor 
experience in the Thomas Jefferson Building.  As part of the Master Plan, the Library is 
developing a resource plan to serve as the roadmap for a private fundraising initiative.  A 
request for the design, fabrication and installation of a Treasures Exhibit Gallery, a Youth 
Center and Lab spaces, and staffing for three years will begin to realize the promise of the 
Visitor Experience initiative, elevating it to a level unmatched among peer institutions in 
Washington, D.C.   
 
Since my confirmation, my goal as Librarian has been to expand users’ access to the Library 
both on site and online. When it comes to our onsite efforts, my top priority is to help visitors 
become lifelong users.  In early 2018, I presented to the Congress an opportunity to enhance the 
visitor experience of the Thomas Jefferson Building.   
 
I appreciate that Congress committed to a public-private partnership to provide $60 million for 
this project – $40 million in appropriated funds to be matched by $20 million in private funds 
raised by the Library.  The Library of Congress Madison Council Chairman has offered to lead 
private fundraising for the Visitor Experience.  The Library has received $11 million in verbal 
commitments and is working with a contractor to develop a capital campaign to raise the rest.   
I am grateful as well for congressional approval of $10 million in fiscal 2018, $2 million of which 
was to be used immediately to contract with a professional firm to create a Master Plan from the 
design concepts shared with the Congress.  
 
We recently provided Congress a first “look in” to the Master Plan, which confirms that the 
Library can accomplish broadly within the $60 million budget what we envisioned during the 
design concept phase last year.  We anticipate revitalizing exhibit spaces, creating an activities 
area for youth, and having a welcoming orientation space where constituents and visitors will 
3 
 
 
 
see Jefferson’s Library as the foundation of the Library, and look up through an oculus to the 
magnificent Main Reading Room. 
 
The majority of changes entail movement and deconstruction of 25-year-old exhibit cases and 
related materials and installation of new state of the art, secure and climate-controlled glass and 
steel exhibit cases.  We have confirmed that building modifications for the oculus constitute 
light construction.  We appreciate that from the inception of the project, both the Architect of 
the Capitol and U.S. Capitol Police have provided advice, feedback, and recommendations as 
we contemplated options with our professional design firm.  
 
As this is your Library, we want your constituents and visitors to have a better experience.  
With so many visiting school groups, we want them to leave more knowledgeable about the 
history of our country, have a better understanding of democracy in action, appreciate what it 
means to be a good citizen, and know the origins of the Library which is also the Congress’ 
story.  We also want visitors to leave motivated to learn more about our country and its cultural 
patrimony.  I look forward to continuing to keep you informed about our progress on this 
project to showcase the unparalleled nature of the Library’s collection.   
 
We are also seeking to enhance user access online through funding for congress.gov, the official 
web site for legislative data, to support high-priority, congressionally requested enhancements 
such as a mobile app, continuous development of the system, and the full retirement of the 
legacy Legislative Information System.  Funding to support modernization of the NLS braille 
and talking books programs through digital delivery to braille eReaders, and by creating a 
cloud-based, scalable infrastructure for internet delivery of talking and braille books, will 
position NLS to serve a far larger patron base.   
 
The Library’s third strategic goal, optimize resources, expands modernization to encompass 
strengthening of our internal capacity and infrastructure in several critical areas.  Our request to 
optimize the policies, processes, tools, and staff capacity and capability of the Financial Services 
Directorate (FSD) is vital to the Library.  FSD needs a modernized skill base in data analytics, 
internal controls, budget, policy, and financial reporting to meet financial management methods 
and requirements that are continually evolving, integrating, and expanding.  Because FSD’s 
non-pay resources support the highly visible, mission-critical Legislative Branch Financial 
Management System, FSD has been challenged to fund needed improvements and acquire a 
new set of capabilities for the future as systems are modernized, processes are further 
automated, and the work shifts from transactional to analytical.  FSD must also reconstitute the 
corporate knowledge that has been or shortly will be lost to retirement.   
 
Information technology optimization requests continue the network modernization begun in 
fiscal year 2018 by supporting operation and sustainment activities including hybrid hosting, a 
robust user wireless network, a staff wireless capability to the Library’s campus network 
leveraging state-of-the-industry infrastructure to facilitate improved collaboration, and an 
4 
 
 
 
enhanced metropolitan area network and wide area network capabilities.   The request also 
provides the Library with a more secure operating environment using the Zero Trust Security 
model and establishes a Virtual Network Operations Center that will allow 24/7/365 
monitoring.   Optimization is also necessary to automate and streamline the manual process the 
Library currently uses to perform personnel security functions, and to implement Enterprise 
Customer Relationship Management (CRM), an approach to managing an organization’s 
interaction with current and future customers with a focus on improving business relationships.   
 
Our fourth and final strategic goal, measure impact, uses data to measure the Library’s impact 
on the world around us and share a powerful story.  Our request establishes a robust data and 
analytics capability, through a centralized data analytics group, with processes, methodologies, 
and subject matter expertise needed to consistently and strategically identify, capture, analyze, 
and make decisions on data from its users’ needs and quality of experiences, in alignment with 
the Library’s new strategic plan.  
 
In closing, modernization and optimization – not only of IT systems, but of the experience 
visitors have when they come to the Library, the competencies needed in a modernized, more 
automated environment, braille and talking book delivery mechanisms, and capacity in data 
and analytics – are critical to moving the Library forward into the future.  The fiscal 2020 budget 
request furthers the modernization efforts of recent budget requests and targets critical 
workforce needs. 
 
Madam Chairman, Ranking Member Murphy, and Members of the Subcommittee, the Library 
is the embodiment of the American ideal of a knowledge-based democracy.  I thank you again 
for supporting the Library of Congress and for your consideration of our fiscal 2020 request.

Testimony of Secretary Rick Perry 
U.S. Department of Energy  
Before the 
U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations Energy and Water Development 
Subcommittee 
March 27, 2019 
 
Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, it is an honor to appear before you today to discuss the President’s 
FY 2020 Budget Request (“Budget Request” or “Budget”) for the Department of 
Energy (“the Department” or “DOE”). 
It continues to be a great privilege and an honor to serve as the 14th Secretary of 
Energy.   
This Budget is a request to the American people through their representatives in 
Congress to secure America’s future through energy independence, scientific 
innovation, and national security.  
As such, it represents a commitment from all of us at DOE that we will honor the 
trust of our citizens with increased stewardship, accountability, and commitment to 
excellence. For too long, government success has been measured by how much we 
spend on it.  This Budget Request makes clear that success will be measured by 
how effectively and efficiently government is able to manage the precious 
resources entrusted to them by the American taxpayer to achieve its mission. 
When I appeared before this Committee last year, I committed to protect our 
critical electric grid and energy infrastructure from cyber threats; improve 
resilience and reliability of the Nation’s electricity system; make progress on the 
Federal Government’s responsibility to dispose of the Nation’s nuclear waste; 
focus resources on early-stage, cutting edge Research and Development (R&D); 
advance exascale and quantum computing; address responsibilities for the cleanup 
and disposition of facilities; and, rebuild and restore our Nation’s security.   
This FY 2020 $31.7 billion Budget Request for the Department of Energy 
(“Budget”) focuses on advancing these commitments – from opening a New 
American Energy Era to sustaining our recent historic economic growth by 
investing in reliable, affordable energy, transformative scientific innovation, and 
national security. 
   
1 
 
 
The Department’s world-leading science and technology enterprise generates the 
innovations needed to fulfill our missions. Through support of cutting-edge research 
at our 17 National Laboratories and at over 300 universities across the Nation, we are 
expanding the frontiers of scientific knowledge and laying the groundwork for new 
technologies to address our greatest challenges. 
When I became Secretary of Energy, I made a promise to visit all 17 of the 
Department’s National Laboratories. I am pleased to report that I have fulfilled that 
promise and have witnessed first-hand the innovative and brilliant work performed 
by the dedicated individuals at each of these sites across the Nation. The National 
Laboratories are doing outstanding work in many areas. Each has a unique, rich 
history of innovation across a broad scope of scientific expertise, and the record of 
collaboration across the National Laboratory system – which makes its impact 
greater than the sum of its parts – has bettered the lives of millions across the globe.  
For example, in 2018, the National Laboratories won 32 of the prestigious R&D 100 
Awards, including technologies regarding new materials, protecting the environment, 
incorporating renewable energy reliably to the electric grid, and sophisticated 
cybersecurity tools. These are just a few examples of the work the National 
Laboratories have done just last year to push the boundaries of research, 
development, commercialization, and national security.   
I am especially proud of the work the National Laboratories are doing in 
collaboration with other federal agencies, universities, doctors, and researchers to 
harness the power of our world-class supercomputers to maintain America’s 
leadership in High Performance Computing (HPC), advance Exascale computing, 
and push for breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI).  
To do so, this Budget proposes nearly $11 billion in early-stage R&D that will focus 
the intellectual prowess of scientists and engineers on the development of 
technologies that the ingenuity and capital of America’s entrepreneurs and 
businesses can convert into commercial applications and products to improve the 
lives and security of all Americans.   The Budget also invests in laboratory 
infrastructure and test beds for future breakthroughs in energy.  It prioritizes funding 
to maintain the world-class nature of national laboratory facilities and better 
facilitate private sector demonstration and deployment of energy technologies. 
Securing Against Cyber Threats 
In addition to nuclear security, our national security also depends on a resilient 
electric grid and successfully countering the ever-evolving, increasing threat of 
2 
 
 
cyber and other attacks on networks, data, facilities, and infrastructure.  Among the 
most critical missions at the Department is to develop science and technology that 
advances these aims.  
At stake is continued U.S. economic competiveness and leadership, as well as the 
overall safety and security of the nation. We need to understand the increasing and 
evolving natural and man-made threats and develop the tools to respond to those 
threats across our energy infrastructure. 
To that end, the Budget provides $157 million for the Office of Cybersecurity, 
Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) to develop tools needed to 
protect the U.S. energy sector against threats and hazards, mitigate the risks and 
the extent of damage from cyberattacks and other disruptive events, and improve 
resilience through the development of techniques for more rapid restoration of 
capabilities.  
Securing against cyber threats means we must also protect against threats to the 
Department’s own infrastructure in science, technology, and nuclear security. This 
Budget takes major steps to safeguard DOE’s enterprise-wide assets against cyber 
threats. It provides $71 million for the Chief Information Officer directed funding to 
secure our own networks, modernize infrastructure, and improve cybersecurity 
across the DOE IT enterprise. Funding for cybersecurity in the National Nuclear 
Security Administration (NNSA) is increased to $208 million to enhance security 
for our nuclear security enterprise. In the Environmental Management program, we 
provide $37 million for cybersecurity at seven cleanup sites.   
This Budget provides the resources we require to secure DOE systems and energy 
infrastructure. 
Improving Grid Resilience 
As we protect our energy infrastructure from cyber threats, we also must 
improve the resilience and reliability of the nation’s electricity system.  The 
Budget provides $183 million for the Office of Electricity to support 
transmission system resource adequacy and generation diversity.  The Budget 
will explore new architecture approaches for electric transmission and 
distribution systems, including the development of the North American 
Energy Resilience Model that will provide unique and ground-breaking 
national-scale energy planning and real-time situational awareness capabilities 
to enhance security and resilience. The Budget continues to advance energy 
storage through the Advanced Energy Storage Initiative (AESI), including 
3 
 
 
development of a new Grid Storage Launchpad aimed at accelerating 
materials development, testing, and independent evaluation of battery 
materials and systems for grid applications. In addition, the Budget supports 
R&D at DOE’s National Laboratories to develop technologies that strengthen, 
transform, and improve energy infrastructure so that consumers have access to 
reliable and secure sources of energy. 
Addressing the Imperative of Nuclear Waste Management 
The Budget includes $116 million, of which $26 million is in defense funds, to 
move ahead in fulfilling the Federal Government’s responsibility to dispose of the 
Nation’s nuclear waste. This request is dedicated to resuming regulatory activities 
concerning Yucca Mountain and initiating a robust interim storage program. 
The Budget Request supports functions necessary to support regulatory activities, 
including legal support to represent the Department as well as responding to 
litigation and other legal matters.  The Budget also provides for technical and 
scientific work necessary to support and respond to any challenges in the regulatory 
process.  Resuming regulatory activities at Yucca Mountain and committing to a 
robust interim storage capability for near-term acceptance of spent nuclear fuel, our 
Budget demonstrates the Administration’s commitment to nuclear waste 
management and will help accelerate fulfillment of the Federal Government’s 
obligations to address nuclear waste, enhance national security, and reduce future 
burdens on taxpayers. This also will increase public confidence in the safety and 
security of nuclear energy, thus helping nuclear energy remain a significant 
contributor to the country’s energy needs for generations to come. 
Energy Independence and Innovation 
The Budget requests $2.3 billion in funding for energy independence and 
innovation. Within the applied energy program offices, the FY 2020 Budget 
focuses resources on early-stage, cutting-edge R&D conducted by the scientists 
and engineers at our 17 National Laboratories who are striving to develop the next 
great innovations that will  strengthen American competitiveness and transform 
society as these breakthroughs reach the private marketplace. 
The Harsh Environment Materials Initiative (HEMI) is a new coordinated effort 
within the Offices of Fossil Energy R&D (FE), Nuclear Energy (NE), and Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) to use common investments. This effort 
will coordinate interrelated R&D in materials, sensors, and component 
manufacturing R&D for advanced thermoelectric power plants between FE and NE.  
4 
 
 
For example, NE’s budget includes $23 million for the Nuclear Energy Enabling 
Technologies (NEET) Transformational Challenge Reactor program, which 
enhances the development of breakthrough technologies that provide the ability to 
manufacture small/micro advanced reactor components using additive 
manufacturing techniques.  Investments will also be aligned with EERE’s Advanced 
Manufacturing Office R&D in materials and manufacturing process research, as 
well as flexible combined heat and power systems.   
The AESI is a coordinated effort across DOE that will accelerate the development of 
energy storage R&D as key to increasing energy security, reliability, resilience, and 
system flexibility technologies. The ASEI will focus DOE’s efforts to take a broad, 
more holistic view of energy storage as a set of capabilities with temporal flexibility 
in the conversion of energy resources to useful energy services. The initiative will 
develop a coordinated strategy for aligning DOE R&D for cost competitive energy 
storage services. 
The Budget supports, and makes for more efficient, programs focused on bringing 
technologies to the market in the Office of Technology Transitions, requesting a 
7% increase from the FY 2019 enacted level. Through coordination with our Labs, 
these efforts will reduce costs to the taxpayer while at the same time providing an 
enhanced technology transfer program to transfer breakthroughs from the National 
Laboratories to the private sector. 
Nuclear Energy 
The Budget for Nuclear Energy focuses funding on early-stage R&D, such as the 
Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies program, which includes $23 million for 
the Transformational Challenge Reactor, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to 
continue to develop an advanced manufacturing technique to demonstrate a new 
approach to nuclear design, qualification, and manufacturing of advanced reactor 
technologies. 
The FY 2020 Budget includes $215 million for the Reactor Concepts 
Research, Development and Demonstration program.  Within this total, the 
Budget provides $100 million  to put DOE on a path to construct the Versatile 
Advanced Test Reactor, a facility that would enable development and testing 
of advanced fuels and materials for the next generation of commercial nuclear 
reactors.  This is one of the highest priorities for the Department.  The Budget 
also provides  
   
5 
 
 
$85 million for early-stage R&D on advanced reactor technologies, including 
$10 million for the Advanced Small Modular Reactor R&D subprogram.   
Within the Fuel Cycle R&D program, the Budget requests $40 million for the 
high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) Civil Nuclear Enrichment 
subprogram. This three-year cost-shared subprogram is designed to demonstrate a 
specific U.S. enrichment technology that could produce HALEU.  We understand 
that multiple reactor designs under development by U.S. advanced reactor 
developers will require fuel containing HALEU.  In addition, the Budget requests 
$36 million for the Fuel Cycle R&D program’s early-stage R&D work in support 
of industry’s development of light water reactor accident tolerant fuels. 
Finally, the Budget for Nuclear Energy also supports a safeguards and security 
program with funding at $138 million for protection of our nuclear energy 
infrastructure and investments at Idaho National Laboratory facilities. 
Fossil Energy Research and Development 
The Fossil Energy Research and Development (FER&D) program advances 
transformative science and innovative technologies needed for the reliable, efficient, 
affordable, and environmentally sound use of fossil fuels. Fossil energy sources 
currently constitute over 81 percent of the country’s total energy use and are critical 
for the nation’s security, economic prosperity, and growth. The FY 2020 Budget 
focuses 89 percent, or $501 million, on cutting-edge fossil energy R&D to secure 
energy dominance, further energy security, advance strong domestic energy 
production, and support America’s coal industry through innovative clean coal 
technologies.   
FER&D will support early-stage research in advanced technologies, such as materials, 
sensors, and processes, to expand the knowledge base upon which industry can improve 
the efficiency, flexibility, and resilience of the existing fleet of coal fired power plants.  
The request also focuses funding on early-stage component research that will enable the 
next generation of high efficiency and low emission coal fired power plants that can 
increase the resiliency and reliability of the electric grid by providing low-cost reliable 
power 24/7. 
Funding is also provided to support competitive awards with industry, National 
Laboratories and academia geared toward innovative early-stage R&D to improve 
the reliability, availability, efficiency, and environmental performance of advanced 
fossil-based power systems. For example, the Advanced Energy Systems 
subprogram will focus on the following six activities:  1) Advanced 
6 
 
 
Combustion/Gasification Systems, 2) Advanced Turbines, 3) Solid Oxide Fuel 
Cells, 4) Advanced Sensors and Controls, 5) Power Generation Efficiency, and 6) 
Advanced Energy Materials. While the primary focus is on coal-based power 
systems, improvements to these technologies will result in spillover benefits that can 
reduce the cost of converting other carbon-based fuels, such as natural gas, biomass, 
or petroleum coke into power and other useful products in an environmentally-
sound manner. 
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy 
The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy budget requests $696 million, 
including the use of $353 million in prior year balances, towards maintaining 
America’s leadership in transformative science and emerging energy 
technologies in sustainable transportation, renewable power, and energy 
efficiency.  
The Budget emphasizes early stage R&D and other activities, which private 
industry does not have the technical capability to undertake. Knowledge 
generated by early-stage R&D to facilitate U.S. industries, businesses, and 
entrepreneurs to develop and deploy innovative energy technologies, and to 
gain the competitive edge needed to excel in the rapidly changing global 
energy economy. 
The request funds $105 million for the AESI, which takes a holistic approach 
to energy storage and develops electric grid technologies to create flexible 
generation and load, thereby increasing the reliability and resilience of the 
U.S. electric grid. 
The request supports DOE’s Grid Modernization Initiative, which includes 
reliably integrating an increasing amount of variable generation into the electric 
grid through R&D infrastructure investments at the National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory (NREL) to accelerate the conversion of the National Wind 
Technology Center (NWTC) campus into an experimental microgrid capable of 
testing grid integration at the megawatt scale. 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
The Department of Energy is responsible for the Nation’s energy security, and the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), one component of that effort, protects the U.S. 
economy from disruptions in critical petroleum supplies and meets the U.S. 
obligations under the International Energy Program. The Budget includes $174 
7 
 
 
million to support the Reserve’s operational readiness and drawdown capabilities.  
The Department is requesting authorization to deposit into the SPR Petroleum 
Account up to $27 million in proceeds from the sale of one-million barrels of 
refined petroleum product (gasoline blendstock) from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve to fund the cost of drawdowns.   
The Budget also proposes to disestablish the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve 
(NEHHOR). In its two decades of existence, the NEHHOR has not been used for its 
intended purpose, and the Administration believes the continued taxpayer-funded 
expense of maintaining the reserve is unwarranted, particularly as the existing 
commercial storage contracts are up for renewal in March 2020. TheBudget also 
proposes to disestablish the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve (NGSR). The 
NGSR has not been used since its establishment, and is not considered to be cost 
efficient or operationally effective. Proceeds of the combined sales of the NEHHOR 
and NGSR (estimated at $130 million in receipts, net of the $27 million retained for 
mandatory sale drawdown costs) will be contributed to deficit reduction. 
Power Marketing Administrations 
The Budget includes $78 million for the Power Marketing Administrations 
(PMAs). The Budget proposes the sale of the transmission assets of the Western 
Area Power Administration (WAPA), the Bonneville Power Administration 
(BPA), and the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA) and to reform the 
laws governing how the PMAs establish power rates to require the consideration of 
market based incentives, including whether rates are just and reasonable. The 
Budget also proposes to repeal the $3.25 billion borrowing authority for WAPA 
authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. 
Leading World-Class Scientific Research 
The Department of Energy is the Nation’s largest Federal supporter of basic 
research in the physical sciences, and the President’s FY 2020 Budget provides 
$5.5 billion for the Office of Science to continue and strengthen American 
leadership in scientific inquiry. By focusing funding on early-stage research, 
this Budget will ensure that the Department’s National Laboratories continue to 
be the backbone of American science leadership by supporting cutting-edge 
basic research, and by building and operating the world’s most advanced 
scientific user facilities, which will be used by over 22,000 researchers in FY 
2020. 
   
8 
 
 
Support for Core Research and Facilities 
We provide $921 million for Advanced Scientific Computing Research, a decrease 
of $15 million below the FY 2019 enacted level. This funding will continue 
supporting the Nation’s world-class high-performance computers that make possible 
cutting-edge basic research, while devoting $500 million in the Office of Science to 
reflect the Department’s plan to deploy an exascale computing system in calendar 
year 2021. The FY 2020 Request also supports quantum computing R&D and core 
research in applied mathematics and computer science, and high-performance 
computer simulation and modeling.   
The Budget also provides $1.9 billion for Basic Energy Sciences, supporting core 
research activities in ultrafast chemistry and materials science and the Energy 
Frontier Research Centers. We will continue construction of the Advanced Photon 
Source Upgrade at the Argonne National Laboratory, and initiate the Advanced Light 
Source Upgrade project at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the 
Linac Coherence Light Source-II High Energy project at SLAC National Accelerator 
Laboratory.  The operations of the light sources across the DOE science complex and 
supporting research across the Nation maintain U.S. world leadership in light sources 
and the science they make possible.  The Budget also supports continued 
construction for Spallation Neutron Source Proton Power Upgrade and Second 
Target Station at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 
The Budget requests $768 million for High Energy Physics, including $100 million 
for construction of the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility and Deep Underground 
Neutrino Experiment at Fermilab, $30 million below the enacted FY 2019 level. 
We will continue to fund ongoing major items of equipment projects, including 
three new projects at the Large Hadron Collider: the High Luminosity Large 
Hadron Collider Accelerator Project; the High Luminosity ATLAS; and the High 
Luminosity CMS detector upgrade projects. By supporting the highest priority 
activities and projects identified by the U.S. high energy physics community, this 
program will pursue cutting-edge research to understand how the universe works at 
its most fundamental level. 
The Budget for the Office of Science provides $403 million for Fusion Energy 
Sciences, including $296 million for domestic research and fusion facilities and 
$107 million for the ITER project to continue to support delivery of the highest 
priority in-kind hardware systems contributions. For Nuclear Physics, the budget 
provides $625 million to discover, explore, and understand nuclear matter, 
including $40 million for continued construction of the Facility for Rare Isotope 
Beams and operations of facilities. For Biological and Environmental Research, 
9 
 
 
the Budget includes $494 million to support foundational genomic sciences, 
including the Bioenergy Research Centers, and to focus on increasing the 
sensitivity and reducing the uncertainty of earth and environmental systems 
predictions. 
Advancing Exascale Computing 
As I discussed last year, the Department’s leadership in developing and building the 
world’s fastest computers faced increasingly fierce global competition over the last 
decade. Maintaining the Nation’s international primacy in high-performance 
computing is more critical than ever for national security, economic prosperity, and 
a continued leadership role in science and innovation. 
I am proud to say that, as of the present day, the Department is actively sustaining 
America’s leadership in this vital area. As of November, the world’s two fastest 
supercomputers were located at DOE National Laboratories – Summit at Oak Ridge 
and Sierra at Lawrence Livermore. In fact, the Summit system achieved the global 
number one ranking as the world’s fastest system in June 2016, was delivered nine 
months ahead of schedule and $13.5 million below budget, and is another example 
of the DOE lab continued project management excellence.  In all, the Department 
currently owns five out of the world’s top ten supercomputers.  In addition, teams 
from DOE’s Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories captured 
the 2018 Gordon Bell Prize, the most prestigious award for achievement in high 
performance computing software and applications. These coupled achievements in 
both hardware and software are significant, since it is by sustaining integrated 
capabilities in hardware, software, algorithms, and applications – along with basic 
research in applied mathematics –that America will maintain leadership in this 
critical field. 
To cement America’s leadership position, the Budget includes $809 million to 
accelerate development of an exascale computing system, including $500 million in 
the Office of Science (Science) and $309 million in NNSA. This reflects the 
Department’s plan to deploy an exascale machine for the Office of Science in 
calendar year 2021 at Argonne National Laboratory, a second machine with a 
different architecture in the 2021-2022 timeframe at Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory, and provides support for the procurement of and site preparation for a 
third exascale system, architecturally similar to the second machine at Oak Ridge, 
delivered to NNSA at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in FY 2023.  
To achieve these goals, the Science/NNSA partnership will focus on hardware and 
software technologies needed to produce an exascale system, and the critical DOE 
10 
 
 
applications needed to use such a platform. This world-leading exascale program 
will bolster our national security by supporting the nuclear stockpile, while also 
supporting the next generation of scientific breakthroughs not possible with today’s 
computing systems. 
Quantum Information Science 
Even as we prepare to deploy exascale systems, we are pursuing research in 
Quantum Information Science (QIS), an emerging multidisciplinary area that has 
the potential to define the next frontier in information processing and a range of 
other fields. Our QIS effort is genuinely interdisciplinary, a $168 million 
investment involving all six major DOE Office of Science program offices:  
Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR), Basic Energy Sciences (BES), 
Biological and Environmental Research (BER), Fusion Energy Sciences (FES), 
High Energy Physics (HEP), and Nuclear Physics (NP). 
The potential of QIS to contribute to a wide range of disciplines is striking.  
Quantum computing promises the capability to attack large problems that elude 
classical computing and to provide new insights into materials and chemistry 
through accurate modeling and simulation of quantum systems. In addition, QIS 
holds the potential of developing exquisitely sensitive quantum sensors, for 
applications ranging from biology to the effort to detect Dark Matter. Finally, QIS 
may hold the key to ultra-secure networking, at a time when cybersecurity is a 
mounting concern. 
The Budget provides $40 million to ASCR, BES and HEP to establish a new QIS 
center, which would integrate universities with National Laboratories, through 
investments across all six Science program offices. We are seeking to sustain U.S. 
leadership in this important and highly competitive area. 
Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), including Machine Learning (ML) defines another 
critical cross-disciplinary activity, with the potential to contribute to advances 
across multiple fields. This is another rapidly developing area in which it is vital for 
America to maintain a leadership role. 
In a world awash with data, AI holds the promise of harnessing and deriving new 
insights from massive data sets. The massive quantities of data generated by DOE 
Office of Science user facilities such as X-ray lights sources are believed to provide 
a major opportunity for the development of new AI applications for data analysis.  
11 
 
 
It is also believed that AI may provide a pathway to improving the performance of 
particle accelerators and other key facilities. The FY 2020 Budget provides $71 
million for AI/ML spread across all six Science program offices for both the 
application of AI/ML to research and the development of new AI/ML approaches 
and algorithms as well as $48 million requested in the FY 2020 Budget for NNSA 
for AI.  
Microelectronics 
By virtue of its leadership in supporting high-performance computing, as well as its 
longstanding sponsorship of research in materials science, the DOE Office of 
Science has been a major contributor over the decades to the development of 
microelectronics. Science has helped lay the fundamental scientific foundation for 
advances in these technologies, while partnering with industry in the development 
of new systems requiring new chips. This role is becoming increasingly important 
as we approach the end of Moore’s Law and stand at the threshold of what is likely 
to be a new era in microelectronics. In an important new initiative, the FY 2020 
Budget provides $25 million for redoubled research efforts on microelectronics.  
The research will benefit from groundwork laid at an October 2018 DOE workshop 
on “Basic Research Needs in Microelectronics,” bringing together top experts and 
co-sponsored by ASCR, BES, and HEP. 
Biosecurity 
As mentioned, back in 1986, the Department provided the original impetus and idea 
for the Human Genome Project, and later partnered with the National Institutes of 
Health, to successfully complete the sequencing of a human genome in 2000. Since 
then the Department’s Office of Science has remained on the cutting-edge of 
genomics-based system biology, making major contributions to the continued 
advancement of the relevant technologies. These dual use technologies have now 
advanced to a point where they pose new and unprecedented security challenges. 
To address this growing challenge, the FY 2020 Budget includes $20 million for 
BER for research related to biosecurity. 
Isotopes 
One of the Department’s important contributions to medicine and industry is the 
Isotope Development & Production for Research and Applications Program, known 
more simply as the DOE Isotope Program. The program, managed by Science’s 
Office of Nuclear Physics, supports the production and development of production 
techniques, as well as radioactive and stable isotopes that are in short supply for 
12 
 
 
research and applications. In doing so, it provides a vital contribution to research, 
medicine, and industry. The Budget provides $5 million to initiate a construction 
project for a U.S. Stable Isotope Production and Research Center at ORNL. 
Fulfilling Legacy Cleanup Responsibilities 
The mission of the Department’s Environmental Management (EM) program is to 
complete cleanup of legacy nuclear weapons development and research sites. It is 
the largest program of its kind in the world and represents one of the top financial 
liabilities to the American taxpayer. EM is working collaboratively with regulators, 
federal, state, and local governments, and others toward a future that drives cleanup 
toward completion safer, sooner and at a responsible cost. As EM is put on a 
sustainable path forward, the FY 2020 Budget Request provides the resources 
necessary to build upon recent successes and bring a renewed sense of urgency to 
the program for meaningful and measurable progress at projects and sites 
throughout the cleanup complex.  
The Budget Request includes $6.5 billion for EM to address its responsibilities for 
the cleanup and disposition of excess facilities, radioactive waste, spent nuclear 
fuel, and other materials resulting from five decades of nuclear weapons 
development and production and Government-sponsored nuclear energy research.  
To-date, EM has completed cleanup activities at 91 sites in 30 states and Puerto 
Rico, and is responsible for cleaning up the remaining 16 sites in 11 states –some of 
the most challenging sites in the cleanup portfolio. 
The Budget Request includes $1.4 billion for the Office of River Protection at the 
Hanford Site for continued work at the Hanford Tank Farms and to make progress 
on the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant. This budget will continue 
progress toward important cleanup required by the Consent Decree and Tri-Party 
Agreement to include a milestone to complete hot commissioning of the Low 
Activity Waste Facility by December 31, 2023. The Budget also includes $718 
million to continue cleanup activities at Richland.  The Budget continues River 
Corridor decontamination and decommissioning activities including remediation of 
the highly contaminated 300-296 waste site under the 324 Building. For Savannah 
River, the Budget provides $1.6 billion, $91 million above enacted FY 2019, to 
support activities at the site. This will include the Liquid Tank Waste Management 
Program, completing cold commissioning beginning operation of the Salt Waste 
Processing Facility, continued construction activities for Saltstone Disposal Unit #7 
and #8/9 design and construction activities for Saltstone Disposal Unit #10-#12, 
and funding to support design and construction of the Advanced Manufacturing 
Collaborative facility. 
13 
 
 
The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is essential for the disposition of transuranic 
defense-generated waste across the DOE complex, and the Budget provides $398 
million to safely continue waste emplacement at WIPP. The Budget Request will 
continue WIPP operations, including waste emplacements, shipments, and 
maintaining enhancements and improvements, and progress on critical infrastructure 
repair/replacement projects, including $58 million for the Safety Significant 
Confinement Ventilation System and $35 million for the Utility Shaft (formerly 
Exhaust Shaft). These steps will increase airflow in the WIPP underground for 
simultaneous mining and waste emplacement operations. 
The Budget Request includes $348 million to continue cleanup projects at the 
Idaho site, such as the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit, and to process, 
characterize, and package transuranic waste for disposal at offsite facilities. It 
provides $429 million for Oak Ridge to continue deactivation and demolition of 
remaining facilities at the East Tennessee Technology Park, continue preparation 
of Building 2026 to support processing of the remaining U-233 material at the Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory, and support construction activities for the Outfall 200 
Mercury Treatment Facility at the Y-12 National Security Complex and design for 
a new On-Site Waste Disposal Facility to support cleanup. 
For Portsmouth, the Budget Request includes $426 million to continue progress on 
the deactivation and decommissioning project at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion 
Plant, safe operation of the Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride Conversion Facility, 
and construction activities at the On-Site Waste Disposal facility. At Paducah, the 
Budget Request includes $277 million to continue ongoing environmental cleanup 
and depleted uranium hexafluoride (DUF6) conversion facility operations at the 
Paducah site. In addition, the FY 2020 Budget Request supports activities to 
continue the environmental remediation and further stabilize the gaseous diffusion 
plant. 
The Budget continues funding of $128 million to address specific high-risk 
contaminated excess facilities at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
Together, these investments for EM will make significant progress in fulfilling our 
cleanup responsibilities while also beginning to address our high-risk excess 
facilities at NNSA sites. 
   
14 
 
 
National Security through Nuclear Security:  Sustaining and Modernizing the 
Nuclear Stockpile and Infrastructure 
Our national security rests upon the foundation of the Nation’s nuclear security 
enterprise and the deterrent it provides.  The Budget funds the overdue 
modernization of the nuclear stockpile and the aging infrastructure that supports it; 
strengthens key science, technology, and engineering capabilities that support 
stockpile modernization; reduces global nuclear threats through nonproliferation 
and counterterrorism initiatives; and designs and maintains safe and effective 
nuclear propulsion systems for the U.S. Navy for years to come.   
The Budget fulfills the President’s vision of rebuilding and restoring our Nation’s 
security through investments in the Department’s nuclear security mission. The 
Budget provides $16.5 billion for the National Nuclear Security Administration 
(NNSA). Of this amount, the Budget Request includes $12.4 billion for Weapons 
Activities. This $1.3 billion increase supports maintaining the safety, security, and 
effectiveness of the nuclear stockpile; continuing the nuclear modernization 
program; and modernizing NNSA’s nuclear security infrastructure portfolio in 
alignment with the Nuclear Posture Review. 
The Budget includes $2.1 billion for our ongoing Life Extension Programs 
(LEP), Major Alteration, and Modifications, a $197 million increase. I am 
pleased to report that the W76-1 LEP completed its last production unit in 
December 2018. Final deliveries to the Navy will be completed by the end of this 
fiscal year. The W76-2 Modification, the low-yield variant of the W76, is on 
schedule, on budget, and will be completed consistent with Nuclear Weapons 
Council (NWC) direction. Funding for the B61-12 LEP and the W88 Alteration 
370 will keep us on schedule to deliver the first production units in FY 2020. The 
Budget also supports the Air Force’s Long-Range Stand-Off program through an 
increase of $244 million from the FY 2019 enacted level for the W80-4 LEP to 
deliver the first production unit in FY 2025 of the cruise missile warhead. The 
request includes $112 million for the W87-1 Modification Program, which will 
replace the W78, one of the oldest warheads in the stockpile, by 2030. 
The Weapons Activities Budget request also includes $309 million for NNSA 
collaboration with the Office of Science on the development of exascale computer 
systems; $778 million for the protection of personnel, facilities, nuclear weapons, 
and materials across the Department’s nuclear security enterprise; and $232 million 
for information technology and cybersecurity protection.  
   
15 
 
 
The infrastructure portion in Weapons Activities increases investments to 
modernize our nuclear infrastructure, improve working conditions of NNSA’s 
aging facilities and equipment, and address safety and programmatic risks through 
facility and equipment recapitalization and the stabilization of deferred 
maintenance. In this Budget is $745 million for construction of the Uranium 
Processing Facility, which is needed to replace deteriorating facilities at the Y-12 
National Security Complex, as well as $123 million for the High Explosives 
Science and Engineering Facility at Pantex, $27 million for a Tritium Finishing 
Facility at the Savannah River Site (SRS), and $32 million for a Lithium 
Processing Facility at Y-12. The Budget also includes $168 million to support the 
Department’s commitment to finishing the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research 
Replacement Facility Project, which is necessary to support the pit production 
mission and other actinide activities at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).  
The highest NNSA infrastructure priority is re-establishing a plutonium pit 
production capability to meet military requirements, supported by numerous 
studies and analyses, of no fewer than 80 war reserve pits per year by 2030. Last 
May, the NWC endorsed NNSA’s recommended alternative calling for plutonium 
pit production at LANL and SRS. This two-site approach bolsters the nuclear 
security enterprise’s responsiveness and resiliency. 
The Budget also includes $2.0 billion for the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation 
program to reduce global threats from nuclear weapons. This critical national 
security program prevents the spread of nuclear and radiological materials, and 
technologies, advances technologies that detect nuclear and radiological 
proliferation worldwide, and eliminates or secures inventories of surplus materials 
and infrastructure usable for nuclear weapons. 
The Budget invests $774 million at SRS in FY 2020, a 76 percent increase over 
FY 2019.  NNSA will continue termination activities for the orderly and safe 
closure of the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility Project. The Budget will 
also continue to pursue a dilute and dispose strategy to fulfill the U.S. 
commitment to dispose of 34 metric tons (MT) of plutonium and modernize 
SRS infrastructure to support the tritium supply chain.   
The Budget provides $372 million for Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident 
Response, $53 million above the FY 2019 enacted level, to work domestically and 
around the world to improve our ability to respond to radiological or nuclear 
incidents, in conjunction with other agencies in a broader U.S. Government effort. 
In the NNSA’s Office of Naval Reactors, the Department has the ongoing 
16 
 
 
responsibility to provide militarily effective nuclear propulsion plants for the Navy 
and to ensure their safe, reliable and long-lived operation. The Budget provides 
$1.6 billion to support the operation of the Navy’s nuclear-powered fleet, the 
continuation of the Columbia-class reactor plant design, refueling of the land-based 
prototype reactor, and the construction of the Naval Spent Fuel Handling Facility. 
Today, nearly 45% of the Navy’s major combatants are nuclear powered.  The 
Department’s role in propulsion plant design, spent fuel handling, and 
recapitalization is critical to the Navy’s ability to conduct its missions around the 
globe. 
Finally, the Budget includes $435 million for Federal Salaries and Expenses at 
the NNSA. This $25 million increase is essential to ensuring our world-class 
workforce of dedicated men and women can effectively oversee NNSA’s critical 
national security missions. 
Focusing Priorities on Core Missions 
The Budget continues to focus the Department’s energy and science programs on 
early-stage research and development at our National Laboratories to advance 
American primacy in scientific and energy research in an efficient and cost-
effective manner.  
Also, in line with Administration priorities, the Budget terminates the Advanced 
Research Projects Agency-Energy, known as ARPA-E, and the Department’s 
Loan Programs, while maintaining necessary federal staff to oversee existing 
awards and loans. Termination of these programs will save over $850 million in 
FY 2020 alone while significantly reducing financial risk to the taxpayer moving 
forward. 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, I reaffirm my pledge that the Department of Energy, along with our 
National Laboratories, will continue to support the world’s best enterprise of 
scientists and engineers who create innovations to drive American security, 
prosperity, and competitiveness. The President’s FY 2020 Budget Request for the 
Department of Energy reflects the priorities to enhance our energy, economic, and 
national security today, while making strategic investments to accelerate the 
breakthroughs that will fuel America’s tomorrow. 
In the coming weeks and months, I look forward to working with you and your 
17 
 
 
colleagues in Congress on the specific programs mentioned in this testimony and 
throughout the Department.  Congress has an important role in the path forward on 
spending decisions for the taxpayer, and I will, in turn, ensure DOE is run 
efficiently, effectively, and that we accomplish our mission-driven goals. Thank 
you, and I look forward to answering your questions.

STATEMENT OF 
THE HONORABLE ELAINE L. CHAO 
SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION 
BEFORE THE 
APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE ON 
TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING, AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND 
RELATED AGENCIES 
UNITED STATES SENATE 
March 27, 2019 
Introduction 
Chairman Collins, Ranking Member Reed, and members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to meet today to discuss the 
President’s Fiscal Year 2020 Budget request for the Department of Transportation 
(DOT).  The President’s budget proposal – A Budget for A Better America -- 
continues to emphasize the importance of addressing our Nation’s infrastructure 
needs using smart, effective and modern methods that provide results and 
maximize our resources.  
The President’s Budget requests a total of $84 billion to support 
transportation programs in FY 2020.  About 75% of this request fully funds surface 
transportation for the “fifth” and final year of the Fixing America’s Surface 
Transportation (FAST) Act and the Federal Aviation Administration’s authorized 
funding levels for the Grants-in-Aid for Airports program.  These programs 
support infrastructure improvements that are critical to maintaining dependable 
transportation systems that support our growing economy.  
The remaining 25% of this request, or $21.4 billion, funds several high 
priority investments and important reforms that will strengthen our programs while 
making them more efficient.  This portion of the budget is a $5.1 billion reduction 
from FY 2019 enacted levels, because of the additional infrastructure investments 
the Congress committed to in the two-year Government-wide discretionary funding 
caps deal.  When you deduct those temporary increases, this request provides a 
robust level for many of the Department’s programs and tracks very closely to the 
FY 2019 enacted appropriations.    
 
THIS DRAFT IS AS OF 3/25/19 AT 2:00. 
 
Comparing DOT Resources Across Years  
  Some have noted that the President’s FY 2020 Budget request is about 20% 
less than the FY 2019 enacted appropriations for discretionary programs.  While 
this is technically true for a relatively small subset of the budget, it is misleading 
and does not tell the whole story.   There are two important points to consider.   
First, unlike most domestic programs, DOT’s mandatory programs are not 
traditional entitlements.  Instead, they result from contract authority that is 
provided for infrastructure transportation programs.  However, these levels are not 
a given.  Every year the Executive Branch and this subcommittee determine what 
the annual obligation limit should be that ultimately controls the level of 
investment.  With this in mind, a comparison of the Department’s overall funding 
of $84 million provides a more representative measure for comparison and reflects 
only a 4% reduction.  
Timing also plays a critical role in developing budgets.  When the 
President’s FY 2020 Budget was being developed, we did not have a final FY 2019 
Appropriation and were operating under a long-term Continuing Resolution.  In the 
absence of a FY 2019 Enacted Appropriation, the Administration relied on its own 
FY 2019 President’s Budget request as the basis for the FY 2020 President’s 
Budget decisions.  When we compare the President’s Budget request for FY 2019 
and FY 2020, the FY 2020 budget provides an overall 8.9% increase.  Further, 
compared to the FY 2017 enacted level, prior to the budget cap deal increases, the 
overall increase for FY 2020 is almost 8%.  This reflects the Administration’s 
strong support for funding transportation infrastructure investments even as other 
portions of the President’s Budget were targeted for reductions.  
Modernizing our Nation’s Airspace 
  The President’s Budget requests $17.1 billion to support the important work 
of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA manages our Nation’s 
airspace and directs the safe transportation of 1 billion passengers and 25 million 
tons of cargo each year.  At the same time, the FAA is continually advancing new 
technologies and innovations that improve its operations and help the Agency keep 
pace with increasing demand for reliable air services.  The FAA’s signature 
NextGen program is focused on integrating these critical safety and innovation 
technologies into the National Airspace System using the resources across its 
accounts.   
The President’s request acknowledges the importance of this program by 
providing $1.4 billion in resources specifically dedicated to NextGen initiatives.  
This is the highest request for NextGen in the Department’s history.  The 
President’s Budget funds the FAA’s overall Operations at $10.3 billion.  While this 
THIS DRAFT IS AS OF 3/25/19 AT 2:00. 
 
level is $70 million below FY 2019 enacted levels, this is only a slight reduction 
overall and certainly sufficient to meet the Agency’s needs.  At the same time, the 
FAA’s Facilities and Equipment program received $3.3 billion -- a nearly $300 
million increase.  These funds will be focused on modernizing FAA’s 
infrastructure to improve safety and reduce flight delays.  
Improving Surface Transportation Infrastructure 
  Consistent with previous years and the Administration’s infrastructure 
improvement priorities, the President’s Budget funds the Federal Highway 
Administration at the level authorized by the FAST Act to support highway 
infrastructure improvements and highway safety programs.  The President’s 
request does not continue the $3.3 billion in funding for the discretionary Highway 
Infrastructure Program, which was new in FY 2018.  Instead, it provides 
substantial additional resources to successful competitive programs.  These include 
$1 billion to the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) Grant program to 
supplement the $1 billion provided by the FAST Act for a total of $2 billion in 
INFRA Grants; and $1 billion to the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage 
Development (BUILD) Grant program.  The INFRA and BUILD programs have 
been effective in delivering high returns on investment by encouraging local 
contributions and partnerships with the private sector.  Another $300 million is 
provided for the innovative Competitive Bridge Program which encourages States 
to replace and repair deteriorating bridges cost effectively through project 
bundling.  In addition, the FY 2020 request includes $500 million to improve the 
Nation’s aging transit assets and infrastructure.  
Transit’s Capital Investment Grant Program  
The Federal Transit Administration’s Capital Investment Grant Program 
supports the construction of new transit, commuter rail, light rail, and bus rapid 
transit projects.  The Administration continues to encourage increased local 
contributions in the funding of transit projects.  The President’s Budget provides 
$1.0 billion to fund the current portfolio of capital investment projects with signed 
full funding grant agreements at the time the Budget was developed.  In addition, 
another $500 million is provided for new projects in the program pipeline as they 
become ready.   
Investing in Emerging Technologies and Innovation  
  Every day, Americans wake up to new and advanced technological 
improvements that are changing the way we live, work and enjoy life.  Technology 
is also rapidly changing transportation.  The Department has a responsibility to 
ensure that new transportation systems are integrated into the overall transportation 
network in a safe and prudent way. 
THIS DRAFT IS AS OF 3/25/19 AT 2:00. 
 
  The President’s Budget request includes nearly $300 million to address 
emerging technologies and innovation.  This includes $203 million for unmanned 
aircraft systems which will be integrated into the National Airspace, and a new 
Office of Innovation within the FAA to focus on integration issues resulting from 
the latest emerging technologies.  Another $25.6 million is requested to protect the 
public during take-off and reentry of Commercial Space launches.  
  A total of $19.2 million is also requested in the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration’s budget to oversee the introduction of automated driving 
systems on our Nation’s highways as this technology continues to mature.  
Amtrak Reforms  
The President’s Budget request proposes reforms to Amtrak that would 
provide efficiencies and reduce costs.  Amtrak’s new leadership team has been 
making strides in implementing practical and effective cost saving measures while 
maintaining quality service.  The President’s Budget funds Amtrak at nearly $1.5 
billion in total.  The Northeast Corridor is funded at $325 million which funds 
Amtrak’s needs based on traditional spending patterns.  Further, the President’s 
Budget includes funding available for rail infrastructure and safety grants – a new 
approach from previous requests.  
The President’s Budget includes a proposal to reform the way Amtrak’s 
long-distance routes are managed.  These routes are currently fully funded by 
Federal dollars and account for the majority of the railroad’s operating losses.  
DOT will help lead the way on a new vision, working with stakeholders to develop 
a rationalized network to provide better, more cost-efficient service.   This 
modernized network will focus trains on shorter distance routes between promising 
city pairs, while providing robust intercity bus service to currently underserved 
rural areas via partnership between Amtrak and bus operators.  
At the same time, the Department understands that many States and 
communities may not have the resources to assume immediate financial 
responsibility for these services.  With this in mind, the President’s Budget 
includes $550 million in transitional grants that would assist States in taking on the 
management of these newly created State-supported routes. The grants would 
support the costs of these routes in FY 2020 and would phase down and out over a 
five-year period.  
Supporting the Training Needs of the State Maritime Academies 
  Along with the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the State Maritime 
Academies provide the education and training needed to successfully support the 
Nation’s needs for qualified and experienced merchant mariners.   The Academies 
THIS DRAFT IS AS OF 3/25/19 AT 2:00. 
 
are currently operating with a fleet of training ships that are either at, or 
approaching, the end of their useful service life.  Funding for the two oldest vessels 
is already secured and plans are underway to build replacements.  The President’s 
Budget includes $205 million for a third training ship to further this effort.   
Thank you again, for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss 
the President’s Fiscal Year 2020 Budget.  I will be happy to answer your questions.

Good morning Chairman Blunt, Ranking Member Murray, and other distinguished Members of 
the Committee. I am Dr. Bob Kadlec, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response 
(ASPR) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Thank you for the opportunity 
to testify before you today on our efforts to support a coordinated response to the Ebola outbreak 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as well as general preparedness for other 
emerging infectious diseases.   
 
This morning, I will share with you how ASPR is supporting the response to the Ebola outbreak 
in the DRC.  I will also take a few minutes to highlight existing public health and medical 
preparedness and response capabilities and how we monitor, consider, and incorporate global 
health threats into the programs and initiatives of ASPR.   
 
 
 
 
Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response: Mission & Duties  
 
ASPR’s mission is to save lives and protect Americans from 21st century health security threats.  
On behalf of the Secretary of HHS, ASPR leads public health and medical preparedness for, 
response to, and recovery from disasters and public health emergencies in support of State, local, 
tribal, and territorial (SLTT) authorities, in accordance with the National Response Framework 
(NRF) (Emergency Support Function (ESF) # 8, Public Health and Medical Services), as well as 
the National Disaster Recovery Framework (Health and Social Services Recovery Support 
Function).  ASPR also supports HHS’s role in the delivery of mass care and human services in 
emergencies (NRF ESF # 6).    
 
2 
 
ASPR coordinates across HHS and the federal interagency to support SLTT health partners in 
preparing for and responding to emergencies and disasters.  In partnership with HHS agencies, 
ASPR works to enhance medical surge capacity by organizing, training, equipping, and 
deploying federal public health and medical personnel, such as National Disaster Medical 
System (NDMS) teams, and providing logistical support for federal responses to public health 
emergencies.  ASPR supports readiness at the state and local level for all threats – chemical, 
biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) – by coordinating federal grants such as the 
Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP), leading programs like the Medical Reserve Corps, and 
carrying out drills and operational exercises to test capabilities.  ASPR also oversees advanced 
research, development, and procurement of medical countermeasures (MCM) (e.g., vaccines, 
medicines, diagnostics, and other necessary medical supplies), and coordinates the stockpiling of 
such countermeasures.  As such, ASPR manages the Biomedical Advanced Research and 
Development Authority (BARDA), Project BioShield, the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), 
and the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise.   
 
In addition to these programs, ASPR supports the development and implementation of national-
level strategies and policies to frame and guide federal preparedness, response, and recovery 
efforts.  In September 2018, the White House released the National Biodefense Strategy 
(Strategy).  This Strategy focuses on naturally occurring, deliberate and accidental biological 
threats.  Importantly, this Strategy is the first to identify a lead coordinating official – the HHS 
Secretary – for the biodefense enterprise.  In addition, this Strategy establishes an organizational 
structure to assess and improve biodefense efforts across the federal interagency.  A second 
critical strategy, the National Health Security Strategy (NHSS), released in January 2019, 
3 
 
provides a vision for strengthening our nation’s ability to prevent, detect, assess, prepare for, 
mitigate, respond to, and recover from 21st century health security threats.  Specifically, the 
NHSS is aligned under three objectives that are flexible and adaptable to existing or emerging 
threats and have an operational focus to aid implementation.  The first objective is to prepare, 
mobilize, and coordinate the whole-of-government to bring the full spectrum of federal medical 
and public health capabilities to support SLTT authorities in the event of a public health 
emergency, disaster, or attack.  The second objective is to protect the nation from the health 
effects of emerging and pandemic infectious diseases and CBRN threats.  Lastly, the third 
objective is to leverage the capabilities of the private sector.  Working within these three 
objectives, the NHSS creates a more resilient medical product supply chain and builds private 
sector health care surge capacity.  This quadrennial strategy supports the National Security 
Strategy, the National Defense Strategy, and the National Biodefense Strategy.  Lastly, ASPR 
leads and participates in a number of international initiatives to build partnerships, enhance 
situational awareness, and work toward better collaboration between international partners.   
 
ASPR’s Support of the Current Ebola Outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  
 
As you are all aware, 2018 brought about a reemergence of Ebola, specifically within the DRC.  
This highly infectious virus is of global concern and international efforts are underway to limit 
its spread within the DRC and surrounding countries.  ASPR is working with the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States Agency for International Development 
(USAID), and Department of State (DOS) to monitor the events within the DRC and is working 
to support domestic efforts, should a highly infectious disease outbreak occur within our borders.  
For this, as with other health security events, ASPR is the designated lead for the HHS and is 
4 
 
responsible for bringing together officials from across HHS to discuss the domestic preparedness 
related activities relevant to the emerging event.  ASPR convened the Disaster Leadership Group 
on January 9, 2019, to discuss the current situation in the DRC.  Participants included 
representatives from CDC, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), and BARDA, along with other relevant agencies and offices.  Staff 
provided updates on vaccination of persons within the DRC, containment efforts, engagement 
with DOS and other HHS officials, and general domestic preparedness efforts.   
 
To support the development of MCMs, beginning during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West 
Africa, BARDA worked closely with partners in industry as well as partners at the National 
Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the FDA, and the Department of Defense 
(DoD) to advance the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.  Last year, 
BARDA transitioned two vaccine candidates (Merck and Janssen/Bavarian Nordic) and two 
therapeutic candidates (Regeneron and Mapp Bio) to Project BioShield.  BARDA continues to 
support late-stage development of these candidates and several are currently being evaluated in 
the ongoing outbreak in the DRC. BARDA is working with NIAID to make these therapeutics 
available for a randomized clinical trial and continues to work with vaccine developers to 
support potential licensure of the vaccines.  The MCM development was supported initially from 
supplemental funding that has been fully obligated.  Through Project BioShield funding, 
BARDA will continue to complete activities in support of FDA licensure/approval of these 
products. 
 
In addition to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics to treat a potential 
outbreak, ASPR is also supporting efforts to augment capabilities across the nation’s healthcare 
5 
 
infrastructure to ensure that healthcare providers have the knowledge and capabilities to support 
a response to Ebola, or other highly infectious diseases should one arise in our country.  ASPR is 
doing this primarily in two ways.  First, ASPR has supported a patient transport exercise, to test 
planning assumptions, supporting infrastructure, and general knowledge and guidance about how 
to handle, transport, and treat an infected patient or someone suspected of infection.  Second, 
ASPR continues to refine regional treatment centers to handle an influx of patients, should an 
infectious disease outbreak occur within our borders.    
 
Immediately after the Ebola outbreak in 2014, ASPR collaborated with DOS and other federal 
Departments and agencies to develop protocols and capabilities, to include transport systems and 
a network of domestic receiving hospitals that could activate biocontainment units on short 
notice.  Since 2014, ASPR has participated in four exercises testing the movement of patients 
from overseas locations to these receiving hospitals.  Three of the four exercises were led by 
DOS and examined a number of international transport issues.  The goal of the fourth ASPR-led 
exercise, Tranquil Terminus, April 9-12, 2018, was to focus on domestic cases and care.  
Tranquil Terminus was a full-scale exercise that included officials from DOS, state, local, and 
health care officials.  The goal of Tranquil Terminus was to review notification processes, 
coordination decisions, and resources needed to move highly infectious disease patients utilizing 
both air and ground transportation resources.  Within the scenario, seven patients were presented 
to healthcare facilities with Ebola-like symptoms.  Each patient received a positive laboratory 
diagnosis for Ebola which triggered a series of notification and coordination processes among 
local, state, federal, private sector, and nongovernmental partners to facilitate the movement of 
these patients to Regional Ebola Treatment Centers.  The exercises revealed strengths, as well as 
6 
 
areas for improvement, in current planning and existing capabilities.  Specific gaps included: 
planning discrepancies; understanding of DOS vendors’ roles; and coordination of inter-regional 
patient movement activities.  HHS is working to address these gaps and is in the initial planning 
phase of designing a follow-on exercise to test an even larger number of patients requiring 
transport and care.   
 
To strengthen regional capabilities to support a response to a highly infectious disease outbreak, 
during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, ASPR, in collaboration with CDC, 
developed a tiered approach to prepare U.S. health care facilities to safely and rapidly identify, 
isolate, evaluate, and manage travelers or patients with possible or confirmed Ebola, like the 
Quarantine Unit at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.  ASPR provided awardees with 
approximately $214 million of Ebola emergency supplemental funding to establish a nationwide, 
regional treatment network for Ebola and other highly infectious diseases.  The funding provided 
through HPP Ebola Preparedness and Response activities has established the foundation required 
for the nation’s health care system to safely and successfully identify, isolate, assess, transport, 
and treat patients with the Ebola virus disease or under investigation for Ebola (or other highly 
infectious diseases).  To prepare for and provide safe and successful care of patients with Ebola, 
ASPR also awarded $14 million (and CDC provided $10 million) from the same supplemental 
appropriation to establish a National Ebola Training and Education Center (NETEC).  NETEC is 
a consortium of three non-governmental U.S. health facilities – Emory University in Atlanta, 
Georgia; University of Nebraska Medical Center/Nebraska Medicine (UNMC) in Omaha, 
Nebraska; and the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation/HHC Bellevue Hospital 
Center in New York, New York.  These are in addition to the clinical facility associated with 
7 
 
NIH.  The NETEC provides expertise, training, technical assistance, peer review, and mentoring 
to state health departments, regional Ebola and other special pathogen treatment centers, state- 
and jurisdiction-based Ebola treatment centers, and assessment hospitals.  HHS funded these 
activities through the Ebola emergency supplemental bill. The period of availability for these 
funds ceases at the end of fiscal year (FY) 2019.     
 
Leveraging the best practices from investments made with the Ebola supplemental 
appropriations, ASPR is piloting innovative, tiered, regional demonstration projects that can 
serve as models to test a Regional Disaster Health Response System (RDHRS) that could 
leverage and enhance existing programs such as HPP, NDMS, and CDC’s Public Health 
Emergency Preparedness Program.  Using HPP funding provided in the FY 2018 appropriation, 
ASPR awarded two $3 million grants on September 27, 2018, to the University of Nebraska 
Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, 
Massachusetts.  Using this funding, these centers will conduct pilot projects to test the 
effectiveness and viability of a RDHRS.  Such a system could help integrate existing specialized 
capabilities, such as the tiered Ebola treatment center network to make specialized care easily 
accessible to all Americans.  The proposed RDHRS could help expand existing training to 
address other modern health security threats including the medical trauma caused by CBRN 
weapons.  The proposed RDHRS model could also expand upon health care coalitions (also 
funded by ASPR’s HPP), adding trauma centers, burn centers, pediatric hospitals, public health 
laboratories, outpatient services, and federal facilities like Veterans Affairs clinics to better meet 
the healthcare needs in a disaster. 
 
8 
 
Lastly, to ensure that our responders are able to support future infectious disease outbreaks, 
ASPR is utilizing Ebola supplemental funding to provide enhanced training to NDMS personnel.  
NDMS has partnered with the University of Nebraska Medical Center to support two specific 
trainings for personnel.  The first, Isolation, Simulation and Quarantine Training, provides 
situational awareness, preparedness and planning, infection prevention and control, and crisis 
and risk communications.  The second, Highly Infectious Disease Patient Transport Training, 
trains personnel in transportation of highly infectious patients to appropriate facilities, use of 
personal protective equipment, and infection control practices while avoiding excessive delays in 
care.  Both of these trainings will ensure that NDMS personnel have appropriate skills and 
general awareness to treat highly infectious disease patients without becoming infected or 
spreading infection within the impacted area.   
 
 
 
ASPR’s Capabilities to Prepare and Respond to Future Public Health and Medical Threats 
 
Ebola is a significant threat to public and medical health and ASPR is working diligently to 
respond to this threat. I would also like highlight ASPR’s efforts to ensure that the nation is 
protected against all threats.  The FY 2019 appropriations bill included $1.9 billion for ASPR’s 
programs and activities, and I would like to thank this Subcommittee for its support of ASPR’s 
programs.  With this funding, ASPR is able to support innovative and effective programs to 
further the nation’s preparedness against all types of threats.   
 
Building and Supporting International Partnerships 
Recognizing that effective response to 21st century health threats requires both domestic and 
international coordination, ASPR has and continues to participate and support a number of global 
9 
 
initiatives to address health security issues.  First, ASPR has developed policy frameworks on the 
distribution of MCMs as well as the sharing of biological samples among countries within the 
activities of the Global Health Security Initiative (GHSI).  The GHSI, created after September 
11, 2001, is an informal network of G7 countries, Mexico, the European Commission, and the 
World Health Organization (WHO) with the goal of addressing CBRN threats to global health 
security and infectious diseases with pandemic potential.  ASPR has also supported close 
coordination with Canadian and Mexican officials to prevent and prepare regionally for a 
potential influenza pandemic under the North American Plan for Animal and Pandemic Influenza 
(NAPAPI).  Specifically, the three nations are working jointly to analyze key challenges, develop 
policy and operational instruments, and test regional capabilities to ensure that we are all able to 
work collaboratively in the event of a potential or actual flu influenza pandemic.  Third, ASPR 
serves as the U.S. International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) National Focal Point, 
communicating regularly with WHO and other global partners to monitor potential health 
security threats.  Lastly, ASPR serves as the lead coordinator of U.S. activities related to the 
Joint External Evaluation (JEE).  The JEE was released in 2016 and is an evaluation and 
monitoring mechanism to strengthen basic national health security capabilities.  Engagement in 
the JEE process allows ASPR to contribute to global health security while ensuring that our 
national preparedness is able to address any health security threats, whether it is domestic or 
originates abroad.  In follow-up to the U.S. JEE assessment, ASPR led the development, and is 
leading implementation, of the U.S. Health Security National Action Plan, released in October 
2018.  The Plan contains hundreds of cross-sectoral activities that the government will carry out 
to address capacity gaps found by national and international subject-matter experts during the 
JEE.  Implementation of the Plan will further the multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary approach 
10 
 
promoted by the IHR to adequately prevent, detect, and respond to public health security threats.  
Through participation in these various international organizations and policy conversations, 
ASPR is able to maintain awareness of emerging threats and has relationships in place to 
communicate evolutions in threats as well as preparedness efforts in place to mitigate such 
threats.   
 
Medical Countermeasures Enterprise 
To ensure that the nation has MCMs available to meet existing as well as emerging CBRN 
threats, $735 million was included in FY 2019 for Project BioShield, an increase of $25 million 
over FY 2018 funding levels, and $562 million was included for BARDA advanced research and 
development efforts. This funding enables BARDA to continue to fill remaining gaps in our 
nation’s preparedness for CBRN threats by transitioning products from advanced development to 
initial procurement and stockpiling.  By using flexible, nimble authorities, multiyear funding, 
strong public-private partnerships, and cutting edge expertise, BARDA has successfully pushed 
innovative MCMs, such as vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics, through advanced development to 
stockpiling and FDA approval or licensure.  In the last decade, BARDA’s strong partnerships 
with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, the National Institutes of Health, and other 
HHS components have led to 43 FDA approvals for 38 unique MCMs addressing CBRN threats, 
pandemic influenza, and emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.   
 
 
To support preparedness for pandemic influenza, the FY 2019 appropriations bill includes $260 
million, of which $256 million is allocated to ASPR.  To date, BARDA has supported the 
development of 23 influenza related products: vaccines, antiviral drugs, devices, respirators, 
11 
 
personal protective equipment, and diagnostics to address the risk of pandemic influenza.   
BARDA has a unique responsibility in supporting advanced research, development, and 
procurement of pandemic influenza MCMs.  While the promise and advantages of universal 
influenza vaccines may take years to achieve, with early stages led by our colleagues at NIH, the 
near-term threat and risk of influenza demand that we work right now to make influenza 
vaccines better and faster, and we must ensure that diagnostic tools and antiviral treatments are 
also available to save lives.  Influenza virus is a formidable global threat to human and animal 
health because it evolves quickly and is constantly jumping between host species.  We must 
maintain our focus and monitor the rapid changes of influenza viruses through effective 
international surveillance and control networks.  BARDA co-chairs an active interagency group, 
the “Flu Risk Management Meeting (FRMM),” that is comprised of partners from HHS 
agencies, DoD, VA, and United States Department of Agriculture, as well as public health 
leaders and influenza technical experts.  The FRMM meets monthly and conducts in-depth 
reviews of all pandemic risk assessment data, including global surveys of emerging influenza 
viruses.  Using this information, FRMM participants review existing diagnostics, antivirals, and 
vaccines to frame decisions and make recommendations to senior leaders to support strategic 
preparedness investments.  Although transmission of H7N9 to humans has been reportedly lower 
in the 2018 season, history indicates that avian influenza eradication is elusive because the virus 
evolves quickly to escape protection by any vaccine.  Consequently, it is critically important for 
the US to continue receiving, in a timely manner, pre-pandemic viruses from China and other 
countries where these viruses emerge, to evaluate the efficacy of diagnostics, antiviral drugs, and 
vaccines.  HHS has made great progress in developing new vaccines and drugs to respond 
rapidly to newly emerging viruses.  However, there is still work to be done to ensure that we are 
12 
 
fully prepared for this threat. Going forward, ASPR will support continued domestic influenza 
vaccine manufacturing and stockpiling capacity and will maintain hard won gains in vaccine 
manufacturing capabilities, advanced development of novel influenza vaccines and therapeutics, 
and international pandemic preparedness activities.   
 
As BARDA develops, MCMs and as products are being manufactured, long-term procurement 
and stockpiling needs are regularly considered, to ensure that products are available and are on 
hand to dispense to impacted populations.  The SNS is the Nation’s largest repository of life-
saving MCM and medical supplies intended to support state and local emergency needs.  In FY 
2019, the oversight and operational control of the SNS transferred from CDC to ASPR.  This 
move aims to more fully assimilate the SNS with other public health and medical preparedness 
and response capabilities under ASPR, improve the efficiency of emergency responses, 
strengthen and streamline the MCM enterprise, and leverage synergies in supply chain logistics.    
I look forward to working closely with this committee as the SNS continues to be fully integrated 
into the ASPR organization.   
 
Domestic Response Capabilities  
The FY 2019 appropriations bill includes $57 million for NDMS and $265 million for HPP.  
This funding will enable ASPR to rebuild NDMS teams and train them to respond to 21st 
century threats and invest in innovative approaches to build regional health system readiness for 
complex mass casualty events.  In addition, the funding will enhance the efforts of HPP to 
prepare the nation’s healthcare infrastructure. 
 
13 
 
The 2018 hurricane season highlighted the importance of regional healthcare readiness and 
medical surge capacity.  ASPR led the public health and medical responses to Hurricanes 
Florence, Isaac, and Michael; Typhoons Mangkhut and Yutu; and the California wildfires under 
the NRF ESF # 8 mission.  The Secretary’s Operations Center (SOC) provided 24 hour, 7 day a 
week monitoring of each incident.  The SOC served as the focal point for synthesis of critical 
public health and medical information.  During these events, the SOC maintained real-time 
situational awareness and provided analytical reports on the incidents to senior leadership.  In 
addition, ASPR worked to identify, organize, and visualize critical information related to the 
communities and people impacted by these events which informed decision makers on what and 
where to provide assets.  During these responses, ASPR worked closely with such officials to 
augment care, when needed, utilizing NDMS teams, U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned 
Corps Officers, Department of Veterans Affairs personnel and facility support, and DoD 
transportation, facilities, and clinicians.  Today, HHS continues to support recovery efforts in 
impacted communities.   
 
Earlier in my statement, I discussed how ASPR is strengthening NDMS to support a future 
response to a domestic infectious disease outbreak.  Going forward, ASPR is working to 
modernize and strengthen NDMS capabilities to ensure that NDMS continues to provide critical 
support during and immediately after public health and medical emergencies.  ASPR has made 
tremendous progress in hiring NDMS personnel – increasing NDMS overall size from 2500 to 
approximately 4000 – utilizing the direct hire authority included in the 2017 Hurricane 
Supplemental appropriation.  Despite this success, the direct hire authority expired in November 
2018, and a gap of approximately 2000 personnel remains.  ASPR will continue to hire personnel 
14 
 
under traditional hiring practices but encourages Congress to consider reauthorizing the direct 
hire authority for NDMS, if possible.  In addition to direct hire authority, ASPR continues to 
seek Public Safety Officer Benefit (PSOB) Act coverage for NDMS personnel.  The PSOB Act 
provides death benefits and educational assistance to survivors of fallen public safety officers 
killed in the line of duty, as well as disability benefits to officers catastrophically injured.  This 
coverage is currently offered to emergency response personnel deployed by FEMA; extending 
coverage to NDMS personnel could ensure consistent coverage for all first responders.  Lastly, 
ASPR will continue to utilize annual appropriations to ensure that NDMS teams are trained and 
ready to respond to 21st century health security threats.   
 
Understanding that strengthening the federal response capability is critical to augment care 
within an impacted community, it is also critical to provide communities tools and resources so 
they are able to respond immediately and mitigating the overall impact of a public health and/or 
medical incident.  HPP was established after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, with the 
goal of improving the capacity of local hospitals across the country to deal with disasters and a 
large influx of patients in an emergency.  Using HPP funding, state grantees initially purchased 
equipment and supplies needed for emergency medical surge capacity.  Over time, the program 
successfully evolved to support local coordinated healthcare coalitions, including hospitals, 
public health facilities, emergency management agencies, and emergency medical services 
providers.  Fifteen years after it was established, HPP can be further strengthened to better utilize 
existing resources and enhance healthcare preparedness and response capabilities at the local 
level.   
 
 
15 
 
Conclusion  
Emerging disease outbreaks, particularly those with pandemic potential, are an international 
flight away, and are significant global health threats that require domestic preparedness 
investments and programs.  ASPR looks forward to working with this committee in FY 2019 and 
beyond to protect the nation from 21st century health security threats.  Thank you, again, for 
your bipartisan commitment to this national security imperative, and I look forward to continuing 
to work together to enhance our nation’s health security.  I am happy to answer any questions 
you may have.

CHIEF OF STAFF, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT
Great power competition remains the central challenge to U.S. prosperity and security. A rapidly 
growing China and resurgent Russia aim to coerce their regional neighbors, undermine long-
standing alliances, and displace American influence from critical regions around the globe. These 
great power competitors are challenging U.S. dominance in all warfighting domains: air, land, sea, 
space, and cyberspace. Additionally, they are confronting us with threats below the level of open 
conflict, through information warfare, ambiguous or denied proxy operations, and subversion.
To face these challenges, the United States Air Force must compete, deter, and win across the five 
priority missions of the National Defense Strategy:  
• Defend the homeland,
• Provide a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent,
• Defeat a powerful conventional enemy, while we
• Deter opportunistic aggression, and
• Disrupt violent extremists in a cost-effective manner.
In Fiscal Year 2020, we will continue to build a more lethal and ready Air Force, while fielding 
tomorrow’s Air Force faster and smarter.
AN AIR FORCE IN DEMAND 
Last year, Congress appointed an independent and bipartisan National Defense Strategy 
Commission to study the global security environment and forces necessary to prevail in an era of 
great power competition. Their conclusion unequivocally stated: “regardless of where the next 
conflict occurs or which adversary it features, the Air Force will be at the forefront.”   
“Regardless of where the next conflict occurs or which adversary it 
      features, the Air Force will be at the forefront.”
–National Defense Strategy Commission

As the joint force prepares for peer conflict, the Air Force continues to be in very high demand. Our 
Airmen perform strategic and vital missions in all domains, across the spectrum of conflict, and from 
65 feet below ground to our highest geosynchronous orbits.  
More than 21,000 Airmen are deployed around the globe, employing unrivaled air, space, and 
cyber power from over 179 locations. Last year, our Airmen conducted more than 50,000 sorties 
and 3,400 precision airstrikes alongside joint and partner forces in the campaign to defeat ISIS. In 
Afghanistan, the Air Force executed 44,400 sorties in support of our Afghan partners, and targeted 
Taliban and extremist networks with more weapons than any time in at least 5 years. Our mobility 
forces transported over 1.25 million personnel, 1 billion pounds of warfighting equipment and 
supplies, and evacuated more than 5,400 patients for critical medical care. To bolster allies and 
partners, we increased NATO interoperability and readiness through the European Deterrence 
Initiative, and Air Force bombers flew over 60 sorties through our Continuous Bomber Presence in 
the Indo-Pacific. Airmen also delivered 152,000 short tons of relief supplies across Southwest Asia, 
supporting those who are displaced and suffering, and demonstrating U.S. commitment to building 
a stable and peaceful region.
The Air Force also performs global, strategic, and critical missions from our homeland. We 
maintain our nuclear force at the highest state of readiness: last year our Airmen conducted 16,425 
intercontinental ballistic missile alert tours and 350 missile convoys across three missile wings and 
five states. In space, we operate 80 satellites that provide communications, command and control, 
missile warning, nuclear detonation detection, weather, and the Global Positioning System (GPS) 
for the world. Our Airmen also support a global intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance 
(ISR) network, and last year completed nearly 57,000 missions, collected over 437,000 hours of 
full motion video, and produced over 1 million intelligence products for our warfighters and 
policymakers. Every day, our Airmen stand ready on a moment’s notice to intercept airborne 
threats to our homeland, and they defend Air Force and Department of Defense networks from our 
adversaries’ persistent cyber-attacks. 
We can only meet these demands with predictable budgets driven by the National Defense 
Strategy. In Fiscal Year 2019, the Department of Defense received its first on-time appropriation in 
over a decade. That agreement required substantial effort by the Congress, and we are grateful for 
your support and confidence.

years under continuing resolutions of varied and unpredictable duration. 
2
Let’s be clear. We cannot fully implement the National Defense Strategy to protect America’s vital 
national interests with unpredictable and constrained budgets.  We must come together to find a 
way forward.
THE AIR FORCE WE NEED HAS 386 OPERATIONAL SQUADRONS
The National Defense Strategy calls on us to compete, deter, and win against near-peer competitors 
and across a wide spectrum of priority missions. 
Last year, in Congressional testimony, you asked us what we needed to implement the National 
Defense Strategy – not “What is the Air Force we can afford?” but “What is the Air Force We 
Need?” We didn’t know, and we should know. You put that question in the 2018 National Defense 
Authorization Act, when Congress directed us to study the forces and capabilities we require to 
implement this strategy. 
Using our current operational plans and future defense planning scenarios projected into the  
2025-2030 timeframe, we conducted thousands of simulations and wargames to answer this  
question. Our analysis produced an unmistakable conclusion: the Air Force is too small for what 
our nation needs. We currently have 312 operational squadrons – the clenched fist of American air 
and space power. To implement the National Defense Strategy and prevail over our highest priority 
competitors, our Air Force needs 386 operational squadrons.
To put this in context, at the height of the Cold War, in 1987, the Air Force had 401 operational 
squadrons. Four years later it would combat the Iraqi military in Operation Desert Storm, and 
decisively defeat Saddam’s forces in just 43 days. Despite a shrinking budget and force size, the 
Air Force continued flying combat missions in the region, and added significant new demands and 
missions in the wake of 9-11. 
The independent and bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission also asserts the need 
for greater capacity in an era of great power competition. We cannot credibly face our future with 
the Air Force of today, evolved over two decades for counterinsurgency and counterterrorism 
operations. We must grow and meet our adversaries from a position of strength.
“

Multi-Domain Operations will integrate U.S. and allied  
forces across all warfighting domains. This concept will  ”
rely on a joint and interconnected network of sensors, weapons, and platforms. Forces will rapidly
share information and present our warfighting commanders unprecedented levels of knowledge. 
With information superiority, we will simultaneously converge warfighting effects from all domains 
and produce intractable dilemmas for our adversaries.
3
Ultimately, Multi-Domain Operations will be executed by our operational squadrons, the combat 
power of the Air Force. Not all squadrons are the same size, and not all squadrons fly airplanes. 
The National Military Strategy directs a balanced “boxer’s stance” of military readiness, and our 
operational squadrons form the clenched fist of American resolve. But a fist is nothing without the 
power of the body – our supporting squadrons – behind it. These squadrons repair our aircraft, 
manage and secure our infrastructure, keep our logistics and supplies flowing, and support our 
Airmen and their families. Our operational and supporting squadrons will fight together, so they 
must grow and modernize together.
AMERICA IS BUILDING A MORE LETHAL AND READY AIR FORCE 
Our National Defense Strategy directs a more lethal and

force packages. 
operational squadrons reach the 80% readiness mark by 2022, 
as we continue to build toward the 386 operational squadrons 
”
we require.  
PEOPLE AND TRAINING.  Readiness recovery is first and foremost about people. Recently 
authorized increases in end strength helped eliminate a shortage of 4,000 Active Duty maintainers. 
In two years we closed this gap and are working to build expertise in these young Airmen. While Air 
National Guard and Air Force Reserve maintainers still face manning challenges, our FY20 budget 
continues this end strength growth by adding 4,400 Airmen and 5,143 civilians to the Total Force. 
To address our aircrew shortage, we are implementing initiatives to increase the number of pilots 
we train, season them in operational units, and retain experienced aircrews. 
Last year we produced 1,211 pilots, 146 more than originally expected. This budget builds on our 
progress and will produce 1,480 pilots in 2020. We are also exploring how to use new technologies 
in our “Pilot Training Next” program, where we are using virtual reality and more simulators to train 
pilots better and faster. As we season these young Airmen, some of our new Active Duty pilots will 
begin their flying careers with a Guard or Reserve squadron and benefit from the deep experience 
we have there. We are also pursuing quality of life and quality of service reforms to retain our 
aircrew. Our new Talent Marketplace gives Airmen greater transparency on their assignment 
process, and we are reducing the number of year-long deployments to improve stability and  
reduce the burden on families.
4
Our Airmen are shifting their focus to great power competition, and we must train and equip them 
for the high-end fight. This budget proposal includes funds to modernize our live and virtual ranges 
and infrastructure to provide relevant and realistic training capabilities against our most advanced 
threats. The Nevada Test and Training Range, the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex, the Utah 
Test and Training Range, the Space Test and Training Range, and several smaller range complexes 
will receive targeted funding to better replicate the capabilities of our peer adversaries. We are 
exploring ways to expand contract adversary air – aircrews who are trained to fly as “bad guys” – 
from a single test case to up to three locations, freeing our Airmen to practice their own skills rather 
than spend time simulating the skills of our adversaries. This budget includes 1.1 million peacetime 
flying hours, the maximum amount of sustainable training, to prepare our Airmen to fight alongside 
allies and partners as vital members of our joint force.
COST-EFFECTIVE MAINTENANCE AND LOGISTICS. We are focusing on innovative ways to 
maintain and supply our aging fleets. Last year, a team of Airmen conducted a detailed sustainment 
review and produced 45 recommendations to ensure our aircraft and equipment are ready to meet 
Combatant Commander timelines. We are fielding innovative

Commander timelines. 
A ready force needs a modernized logistics system to 
” power it. Last year, we established the Rapid Sustainment 
Office to improve readiness and drive down the cost of repairs by using advanced manufacturing 
technologies. Through partnerships with universities and industry, this office is identifying emerging 
technologies that can reduce the cost of maintaining our weapons systems.
We will scale these reforms across the Air Force. This budget includes $16.4 billion in weapon 
system sustainment to support our home station and deployed fleets. We are striving to achieve 
80% Mission Capable Rates in our F-16, F-22, and F-35 fleets by the end of this fiscal year. We will 
continue to focus on supply inventory, increasing our maintenance capacity, enhancing our training 
and proficiency, and moderating our operational tempo to help our maintainers meet this goal. 
AVIATION SAFETY. We will not compromise safety as we prepare our Airmen and align resources 
for great power competition. Last year, the Air Force experienced an uncharacteristic increase in in-
flight mishaps and fatalities for manned aircraft. The safety of our Airmen remains a top priority, so 
we initiated several actions to bolster our mishap prevention programs, including additional safety 
5
training and operational pauses to discuss risk. Our mishap rates are decreasing toward historic 
averages, and we will continue to improve these programs over the next fiscal year. We are thankful 
for Congress’ support and interest in this important issue. We look forward to working closely 
with our joint teammates and the newly created National Commission on Military Aviation Safety, 
established by Congress in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act.
A SAFE, SECURE, AND EFFECTIVE NUCLEAR DETERRENT. The Air Force provides two-thirds 
of our nuclear triad and 75% of our nuclear command, control, and communications capability. We 
demand the highest standard of readiness from the Airmen who manage and safeguard our nuclear 
enterprise. The triad remains the ultimate guarantor of American, allied, and partner security, and 
underpins America’s military power and diplomacy worldwide. As our adversaries continue to 
modernize and expand their nuclear weapons and delivery systems, the National Defense Strategy, 
Nuclear Posture Review, and National Defense Strategy Commission all reaffirm America’s need 
for a modernized triad of air, sea, and land-based nuclear weapons, tied together by a resilient 
command and control architecture. These forces deter nuclear and non-nuclear strategic attack, 
assure our allies and partners, achieve our objectives if deterrence fails, and hedge against an 
uncertain future. Today, we perform these missions with the smallest and oldest nuclear enterprise 
in our history. It is imperative that we sustain our existing triad and replace these aging systems. Our 
budget proposal fully funds our major nuclear modernization programs.
Our Ground Based Strategic Deterrent will replace the aging Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic 
missile, first deployed in 1970. These ground-based missiles are the most responsive leg of the 
triad, given their long range and constant state of readiness. 
Our Long Range Standoff Weapon will replace the Air Launched Cruise Missile and improve 
bomber lethality and survivability through 2060. Our modernized B-52, B-2, and upcoming B-21 
bombers are the most visible and flexible leg of the triad. They can be deployed to signal resolve, 
and their sustained flight times and ability to be recalled increase stability and Presidential decision-
making time.  
Finally, we are modernizing our nuclear command and  “

Airmen with highly advanced and lethal tools to prevail 
in high-end combat.

As we design our future Air Force, we are examining different operating concepts to frustrate 
our opponents and defeat them in combat. We will need systems that can penetrate contested 
environments or remain outside these zones and employ long-range weapons and effects. We are 
investing $1.5 billion to test and prototype game-changing technologies to cement our warfighting 
advantage, including hypersonic weapons, directed energy, and adaptive jet propulsion. Our  
next-generation penetrating bomber, the B-21 Raider, is proceeding on schedule and building on 
three years of successful development. It will be able to deliver both gravity bombs and the Long 
Range Standoff Weapon to hold adversary targets at risk around the world. High-end conflicts 
will require the long-range capability of an advanced bomber fleet, and the B-21 is central to the 
expanded bomber capacity and capability we need.
Our aerial refueling capability underwrites the global nature of Air Force power and enables the 
rapid deployment of aircraft. We recently welcomed our first KC-46 tankers and are proposing to 
buy 12 more KC-46 tankers in Fiscal Year 2020.
The future fight will require a robust network architecture and battle management system. This 
budget funds our continued transition to the Advanced Battle Management System, a family of 
systems that will fuse data from multiple platforms across all warfighting domains. Nearly every 
system on the battlefield will contribute data to this network, and through advanced analytics, 
commanders will understand the battlespace and be able to direct forces faster than our 
adversaries. To develop the capability for successful Multi-Domain Operations, we are upgrading 
legacy command and control nodes and have established an architecture to ensure the many 
programs that must connect and share information will work together. We are also upgrading and 
modernizing our electronic warfare systems, organizations, and analysis capability to dominate the 
electronic spectrum.

While budget increases are making a significant difference and 
restoring the readiness of the force, our analysis indicates that 
”
we must purchase additional aircraft in the future to fully implement the National Defense Strategy.  
Our current fighter force of 55 squadrons is too small. 
At the same time, our F-15C fleet is aging, with two-thirds of the fleet past its certified service life. 
This fleet is expensive to maintain, and F-15C capability against advanced threats is diminishing over 
time. Our budget proposes to replace the F-15C with a modernized successor by purchasing the 
F-15EX. We propose to buy 80 aircraft over the next 5 years. This decision allows us to benefit from 
foreign partner investments in the F-15 line to begin cost-effectively replacing our F-15C fleet.
7
CYBER DOMINANCE. Every day, Airmen encounter sophisticated and persistent adversaries 
in cyberspace, some of whom are now peer competitors in this domain. To meet this challenge, 
we are producing innovative cyber capabilities to repel these threats, defend our networks, and 
support Combatant Commanders around the globe. These capabilities also strengthen domestic 
cybersecurity efforts, and helped counter adversary attempts to interfere in last year’s election.
Our FY 20 budget submission advances how we train and equip cyber forces for Multi-Domain 
Operations. We are investing in new capabilities to identify network threats and vulnerabilities, 
and are designing countermeasures to mitigate risks to our weapon systems. Last May, our Cyber 
Mission Forces achieved operational capability four months faster than predicted. We will continue 
leading joint efforts to supply these Airmen with a new, integrated cyberspace operations suite, 
the Unified Platform. To fully harness this capability, the Joint Cyber Command and Control system 
will provide Combatant Commanders cyber situational awareness and battle management of these 
forces. We face an increasingly contested cyber domain, and these investments will provide the 
tools we need to prevail in both competition and conflict. 
 
ACCELERATING DEFENDABLE SPACE. Our adversaries have recognized the advantages we gain 
from operating in space, and are developing capabilities to deny us the use of space in crisis or war. 
They are developing weapons that can blind or jam satellites with directed energy and electronic 
warfare, target ground sites and infrastructure through cyber-attacks, or physically destroy or 
damage our satellites with missiles or dual-use, on-orbit spacecraft.  While we all would prefer that 
space remain free of conflict, we will deter and defeat these threats in order to secure the satellite 
constellations that power our military forces and civil societies.
 
In January of 2018, we transitioned the National Space Defense Center from an experimentation 
and planning office with weekday business hours to an around the clock operations center to 
protect and defend our assets and interests in the space domain. In July, we transitioned the Joint 
Space Operations Center to a Combined Space Operations Center, integrating the efforts of allies, 
partners, and commercial industry.

The Department of Defense recently submitted legislation to establish the Space Force as a new 
armed service within the Department of the Air Force. This legislation would consolidate missions 
from across the Department into a single Space Force. It would establish a civilian Under Secretary 
of the Air Force for Space and a Chief of Staff of the Space Force who would be a member of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. This proposal capitalizes on the Air Force being the best in the world at space, 
and given the new era of strategic competition, is the right move to posture us for the future.
Finally, we are devoting greater time and resources to train and develop our space operators  
as true warfighters. They will be the cornerstone of U.S. Space Command, our newest  
Combatant Command.  
WE ARE FIELDING TOMORROW’S AIR FORCE FASTER AND SMARTER

warfighter faster.
” 
Our experience shows that delegating authority works. Last summer we set a goal to strip 100 
years of unnecessary schedule from our program plans. So far, we have saved over 78 years and are 
closing in on our milestone. 
Three contributing factors are making us faster.  The first is prototyping.  For example, in 
hypersonics, we are leveraging available technology from across the Department of Defense 
to build, fly, and buy our nation’s first operational boost-glide weapon five years earlier than 
anticipated.  For our Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared Missile Warning satellites, we 
are competitively prototyping a new sensor, retiring this key risk nearly a year earlier, while also 
strengthening the industrial base for future programs.
The second contributing factor to increase speed is the use of tailored acquisition strategies. We 
have empowered our workforce to structure decisions around the specific needs of their programs, 
as opposed to the generic milestones of the traditional acquisition process.  Recently, our F-15 
Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability Systems split its Milestone C decision into two tailored

The third major effort to increase speed to the warfighter is agile software development.  The 
decades-old “waterfall” process for developing software is too slow, very expensive, and often 
doesn’t work at all.  We are making a wholesale shift to agile development, putting acquirers and 
operators together to make rapid incremental software improvements.  We proved the concept 
with a new tool to plan air refueling at the Combined Air Operations Center at Al Udeid Air Base, 
where we command the air war against ISIS, Al Qaeda, and the Taliban. Our agile software tool 
saved the Air Force millions of dollars in fuel each month, reduced the requirement by two tankers 
and ten aircrews, and delivered a modern software planning tool to operators in months, not years.
We established the Kessel Run Experimentation Laboratory to continue applying agile development 
for the warfighter and stood up a Program Executive Office Digital to develop and proliferate best 
practices across the Air Force.  So far, major programs like F-22, the Unified Platform for cyber 
warfare, and the Protected Tactical Enterprise System

Our recent Light Attack Experiment was conducted under these authorities and taught us  
important lessons we would not have learned through a traditional acquisition process. This 
experiment sought to test whether an existing commercial aircraft could perform as a combat 
capable and cost-effective platform to support the global campaign to counter violent extremism. 
Key to the experiment was the development of an intelligence gathering and information sharing 
network that will improve interoperability with allies and partners. Based on available aircraft that 
met experimental criteria, we focused last year on only one aircraft type and intend to expand 
the experiment in this budget to include additional aircraft types (rotary, unmanned, turbojet) and 
improved technologies. Additionally, we intend to continue our close partnership with industry 
and allies to further this technology as we determine the best strategy going forward. We remain 
committed to developing a cost-effective and increasingly networked counter-violent extremist 
capability to deepen these partnerships and directly support the National Defense Strategy.
We are also committed to competition. The Air Force saved over $15 billion dollars through robust 
competition with the National Security Space Launch, Global Positioning Satellite IIIF, the UH-1N 
helicopter replacement, and the T-X jet trainer.

already secured these rights in our UH-1 helicopter replacement and T-X jet trainer programs, and 
we will continue pursuing these ownership rights to flexibly modernize our force.
As we increase competition we are leading innovative approaches to contracting with small 
businesses and start-ups, and last year we awarded over $11 billion to such companies. By law, we 
must spend $660 million through our small business innovation and technology transfer programs, 
and want to make partnering with the Air Force easy and energizing. We created a new mechanism 
to get dollars into the hands of small businesses faster than before. By combining government 
credit card payments with one-page contracts, we created a small-dollar contracting process that 
will “pay in a day.” Last November, we sought to award 50 small business contracts in 50 hours. We 
surpassed our expectations and more than doubled our goal, awarding 106 contracts in only  
42 hours.

AN AIR FORCE TO COMPETE, DETER, AND WIN
The United States faces an increasingly complex global security environment, characterized by overt 
challenges to the free and open international order and the re-emergence of long-term, strategic 
competition between nations. To meet these challenges, the Air Force is evolving to project 
unmatched power through the air, space, and cyber domains. We are prioritizing our readiness to 
fight tonight and are on track to meet our readiness goals. The new authorities Congress has given 
us are allowing us to field tomorrow’s Air Force faster and smarter. We must rebuild the capacity we 
lost and field a force that will compete, deter, and win for the American people.

Chairman Blunt, Ranking Member Murray, and members of the Subcommittee, my name is 
Mark Stringer, and I serve as Director of Missouri’s Department of Mental Health. I also serve as 
the Chair of the Public Policy Committee of the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug 
Abuse Directors (NASADAD). Thank you for the opportunity to testify before the 
Subcommittee today to discuss actions Missouri is taking to address the opioid crisis.   In 
particular, thank you for the opportunity to share with the Committee the importance of the State 
Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis Grants (STR) and the State Opioid Response Grants 
(SOR) – grants managed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA) at the federal level and State alcohol and drug agencies at the State level. 
Critical Role of the SSA 
Critical Role of the Single State Agency (SSA) for Substance Use:  The state agency plays a 
critical role in overseeing and implementing the publicly funded prevention, treatment, and 
recovery service system. All state substance use agencies develop a comprehensive plan for 
service delivery and capture data describing the services provided. It is important that federal 
grant opportunities be coordinated and leveraged with the federal block grants to assure effective 
and efficient use of resources. 
An important focus of state directors across the country is the promotion of effective, high 
quality services. In Missouri, for example, we use our contracts as a mechanism to promote the 
use of evidence-based practices. In addition, we utilize onsite “fidelity reviews” in order to 
assess the extent to which providers are employing best practices in the right way. We also 
engage in on-site certification surveys or recognize national accreditation to ensure that providers 
are adhering to standards of care set by the Department of Mental Health. These standards apply 
to a number of areas related to service delivery, from staffing requirements (number of staff, 
qualifications of staff, continuing education required, etc.) to important rules governing the 
facilities within which services are delivered. 
State directors focus on another important task: collecting and using data to improve service 
delivery.  In Missouri, we obtain data in a number of categories, including abstinence from the 
use of alcohol, abstinence from the use of drugs, impact of services on housing, impact of 
services on employment, connectedness to community, and others. The Division tracks other 
measures such as the number of children returned to their parents’ custody and the number of 
individuals receiving recovery services. A great deal of prevention data comes from the Missouri 
Student Survey, which provides information at the county and local levels, with a sample size of 
nearly 200,000 students. 
State substance use agencies represent a key source of technical assistance to the workforce in 
each state. In Missouri, we partner with the University of Missouri St. Louis, Missouri Institute 
of Mental Health (UMSL-MIMH) to run our statewide opioid grants, as well as a number of 
other initiatives, including our Spring Institute that provides training to thousands of staff and 
administrators in the behavioral health field. We work with the state provider association to plan, 
coordinate, and present trainings on evidence-based practices. My staff at the department also 
regularly work directly with providers, offering technical assistance and training in a variety of 
areas.

Missouri Crisis 
Scope of the Substance Use Disorder Problem in Missouri: It is worth stepping back for a 
moment to first examine the impact of all substance use disorders in the state before focusing on 
the unique issues related to prescription drug misuse and heroin. Overall, it is estimated that 
379,000 Missourians have a substance use disorder. Of these, 17,000 are between the ages of 12 
and 17 years old. 
We know that approximately 8,600 parolees and 27,200 probationers in the state need substance 
use disorder treatment (Missouri Department of Corrections, 2017). Close to 28,400 Missouri 
veterans have a substance use disorder (Missouri Department of Public Safety, 2017) and 8,300 
pregnant women struggle with drug or alcohol use (Missouri Department of Health and Senior 
Services, 2016).  
In Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, about 47,820 Missourians received treatment for substance use 
disorders through the publicly funded system. The majority are individuals who lack resources to 
pay for treatment. Nearly one-half (45 percent) are referred through the criminal justice system. 
Alcohol is the most common substance problem presented at treatment admission (31 percent) 
followed by methamphetamine (21 percent), marijuana (21 percent), heroin (15 percent), and 
other drugs (12 percent). The state has been affected by methamphetamine use predominantly in 
the rural areas and heroin use in Eastern Missouri, including metropolitan St. Louis. Intravenous 
(IV) drug use is problematic statewide due to methamphetamine and heroin use.   
Prescription Drug Use, Heroin, and Illicit Fentanyl: More than 52,000 Missourians meet 
clinical criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). The epicenter of Missouri’s overdose crisis spans 
the eastern region, including both urban St. Louis City and County and rural surrounding 
counties. The highest rates of overdose deaths in Missouri are in urban, predominantly African-
American communities that are underserved and stricken by poverty. 
Missouri had 951 opioid overdose deaths in 2017 – meaning we are losing nearly three people a 
day. And despite our tremendous efforts, preliminary death numbers from 2018 are looking even 
higher. The largest driver continues to be illicitly-made fentanyl, which has infiltrated our heroin 
supply and effectively resulted in an acute poisoning crisis, particularly in the eastern side of our 
state in and around St. Louis. We are also starting to see fentanyl in the methamphetamine 
supply. In the St. Louis region, which accounts for about 70% of opioid overdose deaths in the 
state each year, upwards of 90% of these deaths involve fentanyl. 
Financial Burden: In 2018, analysis by the Missouri Hospital Association found the economic 
burden of the opioid crisis was approximately $12.6 billion each year. These costs are linked to 
premature death, hospital and emergency room visits, lost productivity, vehicle crashes, and 
more. 
Benefits of Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery:  A primary message for this Committee is 
that services to prevent, treat, and maintain recovery from substance use disorders help millions 
in Missouri and across the country. These services literally save lives. We have made dramatic 
improvements in prevention activities, treatment service delivery, and recovery support services 
in the last two years, largely because of the generous federal funds we have received, 
3 
 
combined with the urgency we all feel to put an end to this overdose crisis. As I will describe 
shortly, our evidence-based treatment efforts have shown incredible growth and improvement, 
resulting in nothing less than a system transformation in Missouri. 
Introduction to Grant Efforts 
Missouri received two large grants from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration (SAMHSA) to address the opioid crisis— the State Targeted Response (STR) 
grant of $10M for two years (FY 2017-2018) and the State Opioid Response (SOR) grant of over 
$18M for two years (FY 2018-2019). As a State Department, we have become even more 
rigorous in our prioritization of evidence based models of care for prevention, treatment, and 
recovery. This includes our transformative approach to opioid use disorder (OUD) – what we 
call the “Medication First” Model of treatment.  The key tenets of this model include:  
  People with OUD receive pharmacotherapy as quickly as possible, prior to lengthy 
assessments or treatment planning sessions;  
  Maintenance pharmacotherapy is delivered without arbitrary tapering or time limits; 
  Individualized psychosocial services are offered but not required as a condition of 
pharmacotherapy; 
  Addiction medications are discontinued only if it is worsening the patient’s condition. 
In addition to the STR and SOR grants, we have pursued and secured multiple other grants to 
address the overdose crisis. We used a Prescription Drug and Opiate Addiction (PDOA) grant to 
expand access to medication assisted treatment (MAT) in our hardest hit areas and it afforded us 
the opportunity to begin work on the Medication First model. We also utilize the Prescription 
Drug/Opioid Overdose grant to expand overdose education and naloxone to emergency 
responders and social service agents out in the field. We are committed to leveraging and 
coordinating all dollars and grants – local, state, and federal – to make sure all money is spent as 
efficiently and effectively as possible.  
 
Consistent with SAMHSA’s target domains, the goals of the Missouri Opioid STR/SOR project 
included:  
1.  Increase student-focused opioid use and overdose prevention initiatives and programs; 
2.  Increase access to evidence-based MAT for uninsured and underinsured individuals with 
OUD through provider training, direct service delivery, health care integration, and 
improved transitions of care;  
3.  Increase the number of individuals with OUD who receive recovery support services; 
and,  
4.  Enhance sustainability through policy and practice changes as well as demonstrated 
clinical and cost effectiveness of grant-supported protocols.

Stakeholders and Collaborations 
Planning and Coordination with Other State Agencies, Providers, Stakeholders: In 
Missouri, we understand that substance use disorders impact every aspect of our society. No one 
is immune from developing this disease, and resources must be used wisely to impact this 
community crisis. As a result, our agency directs a tremendous amount of energy building

Missouri Outcomes of Federal Opioid Funding 
We are extremely grateful for the resources that Congress has provided states, as well as all the 
time and energy placed on loosening the grip this crisis has on our whole nation.  
 
We have spent these dollars on what we believe must be prioritized in this current public health 
emergency: increasing access to life-saving services, including naloxone for overdose reversal 
and maintenance medical treatment for opioid use disorder. Our efforts focus on three broader, 
sequential goals: survival, stabilization, and thriving. This broadly represents our efforts in 
three areas: prevention, treatment, and recovery.  
 
PREVENTION (SURVIVAL) 
 
Survival Snapshot: Our focus has been on preventing the development and consequences of 
addiction by training youth to avoid drug misuse, training providers how best to treat chronic 
pain, and saturating high-risk communities with naloxone, the opioid overdose antidote. 
 Trained over 10,000 youth how to avoid prescription drug misuse 
 Trained nearly 450 predominantly rural medical providers how to manage chronic pain 
safely and effectively 
 Trained nearly 15,000 individuals in opioid overdose education and the use of 
Narcan/naloxone. 
 Distributed nearly 60,000 doses of naloxone 
 Collected 2,230 reports of lives saved through the Overdose Field Report system we 
created with these grants. 
Addressing Overdose: Through the STR/SOR and PDO grant projects combined, 14,340 
individuals have been trained in overdose education and naloxone distribution, 17,827 boxes of 
naloxone have been distributed, and OUD treatment has been initiated for 4,072 individuals. 
7 
 
Through STR/SOR, OEND trainings have been provided to 6,155 individuals including criminal 
justice staff and justice-involved persons, pharmacy management and frontline technicians, 
recovery housing providers, and recovery support group members. Eight thousand seven hundred 
nineteen (2-dose) naloxone kits have been distributed through STR (in addition to 3,100 intra-
muscular naloxone provided by Direct Relief, a humanitarian aid organization that provides free 
naloxone to non-profit entities.) Through MO-HOPE, OEND trainings have been provided to 
8,185 individuals including emergency responders, treatment and medical providers and other 
social service agency staff. Seven thousand six hundred thirty three (2-dose) naloxone kits have 
been distributed (in addition to 3,499 intra-muscular naloxone provided by Direct Relief.) 
Community Pharmacy Naloxone Expansion: Over 1,169 pharmacists and pharmacy students 
across the state have participated in an overdose and naloxone information training. Criminal 
Justice Overdose Prevention Program – Mo’ Heroes: 1,314 individuals, both staff and criminal-
justice involved individuals, have received OEND training.  
Notably, prior to the start of these grants, MO was well above the national average for rate of 
increase in opioid overdose deaths (35% increase in MO vs. a 28% increase nationally); after, we 
were well below the average rate of increase (5% increase in MO vs. a 16% increase nationally)  
See below figure: 
 
 
 
 
Addressing Opiate Prescribing: The Missouri Telehealth Network (MTN) conducts numerous 
Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) projects. For STR/SOR, MTN created 
an ECHO on Chronic Pain Management for primary care providers. The ECHO team has 
conducted 33 sessions, reaching 136 unique providers. The most recent session took place on 
December 20, 2018, with seven more sessions planned over the rest of the grant year.   
 
Preventing Use/Misuse: Though the focus of our spending has been on helping those already in 
the throes of addiction and at greatest risk of death, we have also dedicated robust efforts 
towards prevention initiatives. We’ve provided school-based training and education about 
prescription drug misuse to over 11,000 students, and have partnered with the Boys and Girls 
Clubs of America to implement novel prevention programs in their clubhouses so we can reach 
youth who are likely at highest risk of developing addiction later in life. 
 
8 
 
TREATMENT (STABILIZATION) 
 
Stabilization Snapshot:  Our focus has been on improving access to medical treatment for OUD 
by providing rigorous multidisciplinary training and consultation, connecting overdose survivors 
to community treatment, and delivering effective, evidence-based treatment services to 
thousands of Missourians struggling with opioid addiction.  
  Trained over 4,000 medical and behavioral healthcare providers on best practices for 
OUD treatment.  
  Reached over 2,000 overdose survivors in emergency departments to connect them 
with treatment and other services.  
  Provided evidence-based medical treatment to over 4,000 individuals under our new 
Medication First treatment model.  
The following improvements have been realized when comparing treatment prior to STR and 
SOR grants: 1) better access to medications for OUD, 2) faster access to those medications, 3) 
improved treatment retention at 1, 3, and 6 months, and 4) 26% lower average monthly cost of 
treatment.  
Sustainable Treatment  
Intervention Post-Overdose: Through Opioid STR/SOR funding, Missouri has expanded the 
Engaging Patients in Care Coordination (EPICC) project and was able to secure state funding to 
replicate the model statewide. Patients routinely present to emergency departments seeking help 
with opioid withdrawal and – all too often – needing emergency resuscitation for opioid 
overdose. Emergency Department (ED) physicians are uniquely positioned to change the life 
trajectory of patients who present due to opioid overdose and can serve as a link for at-risk 
patients into treatment and recovery support services.  Utilizing evidenced-based, FDA-approved 
medicines (e.g. buprenorphine) in the ED improve patient engagement and connection to opioid 
use disorder treatment services, and ultimately reduce patient mortality. The EPICC project 
expedites access to MAT and improves the coordination of care between emergency departments 
and community-based settings. Recovery coaches meet patients post-overdose in the emergency 
department and connect patients to SUD treatment agencies. This peer outreach has been 
provided to more than 2,200 individuals since May 2017. 
Medical Treatment Providers: A key concern when utilizing time-limited grant dollars is 
sustainability of efforts. Missouri realized that trainings in key areas represented core 
sustainability in use of naloxone (identified above) addiction medications. Unfortunately, access 
to evidence-based addiction medications is limited by a lack of knowledge by medical 
professionals and exacerbated by the need for prescribers to obtain a DEA waiver in order to 
offer the gold standard of care in the initial treatment of OUD: buprenorphine. Prescribing and 
managing this medication requires eight hours of training for physicians and 24 hours of training 
for mid-level practitioners (advance practice nurses and physician assistants). Missouri worked 
hard to outreach to prescribers already working in behavioral health, but also primary care 
providers working in Federally Qualified Health Centers and emergency department physicians. 
We have also provided technical assistance directly to FQHCs to promote the treatment of OUD 
9 
 
within the primary care health system.  Under these grants, Missouri has thus far secured waiver 
training for nearly 150 professionals and most of them have successfully obtained the waiver 
needed to prescribe buprenorphine products.  
We have also recognized the need for ongoing training and clinical support for prescribers, so an 
ECHO specific to the management of OUD was developed by the Missouri Telehealth Network 
(MTN). The MTN has also launched a Project ECHO on OUD Treatment. The OUD ECHO 
team has conducted 22 sessions, reaching over 179 unique providers. The second round of OUD 
ECHO is set to begin in April. 
Medical Treatment Model: Maintenance pharmacotherapy with buprenorphine or methadone 
can reduce fatal opioid overdose rates by 50-70%, reduce illicit drug use, and increase treatment 
retention. However, in traditional treatment programs for addiction, the vast majority of patients 
are offered no ongoing medical treatment. Those who do receive medical care often face 
intensive psychosocial service requirements that make treatment both burdensome and costly. 
Though we wholeheartedly believe all clients should be offered a full menu of psychosocial 
support services such as counseling, family therapy, job training, case management, and more, 
we also believe medication should not be withheld as a condition of mandatory participation in 
these services. In Missouri we set forth with renewed focus to promote individualized 
psychosocial treatment rather than arbitrary requirements, ensuring each client gets exactly what 
he or she needs – nothing more, nothing less. 
Through STR, we finalized and disseminated a treatment model we refer to as “Medication 
First.” The name and principles of Medication First are borrowed from the Housing First 
approach to homelessness. The National Alliance to End Homelessness explains: “Housing First 
is a homeless assistance approach that prioritizes providing people experiencing homelessness 
with permanent housing as quickly as possible – and then providing voluntary supportive 
services as needed.” This approach prioritizes client choice in both housing selection and service 
participation. Our Medication First model similarly prioritizes rapid and sustained access to a 
lifesaving resource – medication for opioid use disorder – as a central tenet of treatment. 
The Medication First (or low-barrier maintenance pharmacotherapy) approach to the treatment of 
Opioid Use Disorders (OUD) is based on a broad scientific consensus that the epidemic of fatal 
accidental poisoning (overdose) is one of the most urgent public health crises in our time. 
Increasing access to buprenorphine and methadone maintenance is the most effective way to 
reverse the overdose death rate. Increased treatment access will best be achieved by integrating 
buprenorphine induction, stabilization, maintenance, and referral throughout specialty addiction 
programs, as well as primary care clinics and other medical settings throughout the mainstream 
healthcare system. 
Supporting System Change: Understanding how to successfully and efficiently manage a clinic 
that offers addiction medications, as well as how to provide psychosocial services that 
complement the use of these medications, also requires training. Changing practices and attitudes 
were essential to adopting evidence-based treatment that lasts longer than the life of the federal 
funding.  
10 
 
  Training and Consultation to Address Provider-Level Knowledge and Attitudinal 
Barriers: To address gaps in knowledge about MAT and reduce attitudinal barriers to 
MAT, we developed a multimodal, multidisciplinary training curriculum called Opioid 
Crisis Management Training (OCMT) in collaboration with consulting physicians, 
nurses, counselors, social workers, and people who use drugs and/or are in recovery. The 
training curriculum includes a content lecture on the role of brain chemistry in opioid 
addiction, the science of MAT, the role of the counselor in treating OUD, a panel of 
individuals sharing how MAT has helped them achieve recovery, and profession-specific 
breakout sessions to promote dialogue and problem-solving about MedFirst 
implementation. Preliminary evaluation shows OCMTs improve knowledge and attitudes 
surrounding MAT and serve as an opportunity to connect with providers and encourage 
utilization of our ongoing training and consultation services.  
 
  Steps to Address Agency-level Barriers: To support MedFirst implementation, we 
assessed program readiness through environmental scans and site visits; held bi-monthly, 
statewide open “Office Hours” calls to discuss administrative and clinical questions; and 
provided data-driven, program-specific “Treatment Barometers” comparing data from 
Pre-STR and STR timeframes. Many state-contracted treatment agencies are in rural 
areas where transportation and access to waivered prescribers are limited. Thus, to 
increase access to care and reduce frequency of canceled or “no-show” appointments, 
STR funds were used to purchase telemedicine equipment and reimburse agencies for 
client transportation. Additionally, cross-agency collaboration was facilitated to increase 
prescriber capacity. 
 
  Process, Policy, and Procedural Changes to Address Structural and Systemic 
Barriers: We anticipated several structural and systemic barriers to implementing 
MedFirst. These included: 
 
1) State billing requirements and intake procedures; 
2) buprenorphine prior authorizations and step-down dosing requirements in our 
Medicaid program;  
3) over-utilization of group services, non-medical detoxification, and residential 
services;  
4) high administrative burden coupled with low reimbursement rates for medical 
services; and  
5) a dearth of buprenorphine waivered providers in our state.  
 
To address 1) we altered State billing requirements to allow 30 days for completion of 
STR client assessments, facilitating faster client access to medical providers. Regarding 
2) through collaboration with the Missouri Medicaid program, prior authorizations for 
initial buprenorphine prescriptions were removed, as were requirements for step down 
dosing and tapering plans. (Though uninsured individuals were the target of STR 
treatment funds, we also worked simultaneously to remove barriers in the Medicaid 
system.) Over utilization of group services, non-medical detoxification, and residential 
services 3) was addressed by removing these from the STR services menu and only 
11 
 
allowing for their reimbursement through existing agency allocations. To begin to 
remedy 4), we increased the provider administrative payments on medical services from 
7% to 15% for the STR program. Last, STR leaders addressed Missouri’s lack of 
buprenorphine prescribers 5) by offering state-sponsored DATA 2000 trainings and a 
reimbursement to medical providers who obtained their waiver.  
 
These system-level changes, coupled with the provider- and agency-focused efforts, aimed to 
incentivize best practice and remove as many obstacles to MedFirst implementation as possible. 
 
Our early findings are very promising. As stated above, through STR and SOR, we have treated 
over 4,200 people with OUD and found they are more likely to: obtain medical treatment; be 
connected to that medical treatment faster; be retained in treatment at 1, 3, and 6 months; and 
have lower average monthly costs of treatment than prior to the STR and SOR grants.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 
 
RECOVERY (THRIVING) 
Thriving Snapshot: Our focus has been on building fulfillment and meaning in peoples’ lives 
while they seek or complete formal treatment programs. We have accomplished this through the 
establishment of Recovery Community Centers in high-need areas, providing safe recovery 
housing to individuals in need, and building the workforce of peer specialists.  
 Funded four Recovery Community Centers that have served over 14,000 people to help 
them find jobs, housing, and community connections. 
 Provided secure housing to over 700 people who were engaged in treatment but didn’t 
have anywhere safe to live while they did so. 
 Trained 338 individuals to become Certified Peer Specialists so they can join the 
workforce and give back by sharing their lived experience with people who can benefit 
from what they’ve been through. 
Recovery Community Centers: With support from STR/SOR, Recovery Community Centers 
(RCCs) have been an integral part of Missouri’s work on the opioid epidemic. RCCs are 
independent, non-profit organizations that help individuals recovering from substance use 
disorders. They help build recovery capital by providing advocacy training, recovery 
information, mutual-help or peer-support groups, social activities, and other community-based 
services. In 2018, Missouri RCCs served over 14,000 people. About 58% of those people were 
individuals with an Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). 
Our RCCs were open over 9,000 hours, offered 3,569 activities, and distributed over 3,000 
Narcan kits. RCCs completed outreach to 3,296 people with OUD. The RCCs served over 8,000 
total individuals with OUD in 2018. 
Safe and Sober Housing. Through STR/SOR, and the Missouri Coalition of Recovery Support 
Providers (MCRSP), Missouri has built a network of National Alliance for Recovery Residences 
(NARR) accredited and medication-friendly recovery housing entities for individuals enrolled in 
STR/SOR treatment programs. To date, more than 52 houses have been approved to receive 
STR/SOR funds.  Over 700 individuals have received more than 15,000 bed nights to support 
individuals with OUD as they receive Medication First treatment through STR/SOR contracted 
treatment site.  
Recommendations for Federal Action: 
First, I want to applaud a strong SAMHSA under the leadership of Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz. 
She and her management team have worked hard to ensure that these vital grant funds are 
distributed quickly and implemented effectively. 
In this report, I have outlined what Missouri has been able to accomplish in the areas of 
prevention, treatment, and recovery specific to opioid use disorders. While we’ve done so much 
with the federal opioid dollars, we need to think about a bigger, longer-term investment in these 
efforts to make a significant impact and make death rates go down.  
13 
 
We are fighting an urgent and very steep uphill battle here – as much as these generous grant 
dollars have helped, we still have people who cannot get into lifesaving treatment or find 
affordable recovery housing in our state. We know this becomes a death sentence for many, but 
we still don’t have enough resources to help everyone who needs it. 
Broader SUD Focus: Again, while we appreciate the opioid specific resources, we would 
recommend a transition over time from opioid specific resources to investing funds in the SAPT 
Block Grant.  This allows for flexibility in directing funds to a range of alcohol or drug issues 
across the continuum – prevention, treatment, and recovery.  This approach would benefit all 
states and territories. An important feature of the SAPT Block Grant is flexibility. Specifically, 
the program is designed to allow states to target resources according to regional and local 
circumstances instead of predetermined federal mandates. This is particularly important given 
the diversity of each state’s population, geography, trends in terms of drugs of use/misuse, and 
financing structure. We know that alcohol use disorders kill as many, or more, individuals per 
year – but does so more insidiously. We also know that some states or regions are impacted more 
by methamphetamine, which also causes devastation in families and communities. 
Ensure Federal Addiction Initiatives Work through State Substance Use Agencies: State 
substance use agencies work with stakeholders to craft and implement a statewide, coordinated 
system of care for substance use disorder treatment, prevention, and recovery. In so doing, state 
agencies employ a number of tools to ensure public dollars are dedicated to effective 
programming. These tools include performance and outcome data reporting and management, 
contract monitoring, corrective action planning, onsite reviews, training, and technical 
assistance. States also redirect, redistribute, or eliminate support for programs that are not 
achieving results. In addition, state substance use agencies work to ensure that services are of the 
highest quality through state or nationally established standards of care. Federal policies that 
promote working through the state substance use agency ensure that initiatives are coordinated, 
accountable, effective, and efficient.  
Maintain a strong commitment to the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) 
Block Grant without ever losing focus on prevention services: We recommend that Congress 
maintain robust support for the SAPT Block Grant, an effective and efficient program supporting 
prevention, treatment, and recovery services. In FY 2018, the SAPT Block Grant provided 
treatment services for 1.5 million Americans. During the same year, of patients discharged from 
treatment, 76 percent were abstinent from alcohol and approximately 60 percent were abstinent 
from illicit drugs.   
By statute, states must dedicate at least 20 percent of SAPT Block Grant funding for primary 
substance use prevention services. This prevention set-aside is by far the largest source of 
funding for each state agency’s prevention budget, representing on average 70 percent of the 
primary prevention funding that states, U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia coordinate. 
In 35 states, the prevention set aside represents 50 to 100 percent of the substance use agency’s 
budget. 
We appreciate the difficult decisions Congress must face given the current fiscal climate. We 
believe it is equally important to note that trends in federal appropriations for the SAPT Block 
Grant have led to a gradual but marked erosion in the program’s reach.

STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE JAMES BYRNE 
GENERAL COUNSEL, PERFORMING THE DUTIES OF DEPUTY SECRETARY 
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS’ AFFAIRS 
BEFORE THE 
SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, VETERANS AFFAIRS AND 
RELATED AGENCIES 
 
FEBRUARY 5, 2019 
 
Good morning Chairman Boozman, Ranking Member Schatz, and distinguished 
Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today in support 
of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) initiative to modernize its electronic health 
record (EHR) through the acquisition and deployment of the Cerner Millennium EHR 
solution.  I am accompanied today by Mr. John Windom, Executive Director of the Office 
of Electronic Health Record Modernization (OEHRM), Dr. Laura Kroupa, Acting Chief 
Medical Officer of OEHRM and Mr. John Short, Technology and Integration Officer of 
OEHRM.   
 
I want to begin by thanking Congress, and specifically this Subcommittee, for 
your continued support and shared commitment for the program’s success.  Because of 
your continued support, VA has been able to stay on track for implementation, enabling 
us to continue our mission of improving health care delivery to our Nation’s Veterans 
and those who care for them while being a good steward of taxpayer dollars. 
 
Background 
 
On May 17, 2018, VA awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) 
EHR contract to Cerner.  Given the complexity of the environment, VA has awarded this 
ID/IQ to provide maximum flexibility and the necessary structure to control cost.  
Through this acquisition, VA will adopt the same EHR solution as the Department of 
Defense (DoD).  The solution allows patient data to reside in a single hosting site using 
a single common system to enable the sharing of health information, improve care 
delivery and coordination, and provide clinicians with data and tools that support patient 
safety.  VA believes that implementing a single EHR will allow for seamless care for our 
Nation’s Servicemembers and Veterans.  
 
Program Milestones 
 
Since contract award, VA has accomplished several key events outlined below.  
 
Task Orders 
 
As mentioned earlier, VA awarded the Cerner contract on May 17, 2018.  VA 
also awarded the first three Task Orders (TO), which are project management, Initial 
Operating Capabilities (IOC) site assessments, and data hosting.  In September of 
1 
 
 
2018, VA awarded three TOs for Data Migration and Enterprise Interface Development, 
Functional Baseline Design and Development and IOC Deployment.  By leveraging the 
ID/IQ contract structure, VA can award TOs as needs arise and negotiate firm-fixed-
prices on an individual TO basis, allowing VA to moderate work and modify deployment 
strategies efficiently.  Below are additional details regarding the TOs:  
 
  Task Order 1- EHRM Project Management, Planning Strategy, and Pre-IOC  
Under this task order, Cerner will provide project management, planning, 
strategy, and pre-IOC build support.  More specifically, the scope of services 
included in this task order are project management; enterprise management; 
functional management; technical management; enterprise design and build 
activities; and pre-IOC infrastructure build and testing. 
 
  Task Order 2-  EHRM Site Assessments - Veterans Integrated Service 
Network (VISN) 20  
Under this task order, Cerner will conduct facility assessments, to prepare for the 
commercial EHR implementation, for the following VISN 20 IOC sites:  Mann-
Grandstaff VA Medical Center (VAMC) (Spokane WA), Seattle VAMC, and 
American Lake VAMC (Tacoma, WA).  Cerner will also provide VA with a 
comprehensive current-state assessment to inform site-specific implementation 
activities and task order-specific pricing adjustments. 
 
  Task Order 3- EHRM Hosting 
Under this task order, Cerner will be funded to deliver a comprehensive EHRM 
hosting solution and start associated services to include hosting for EHRM 
applications, application services, and supporting EHRM data. 
 
  Task Order 4- Data Migration and Enterprise Interface Development 
Cerner will provide data migration planning refinement, analysis, development, 
testing, and execution.  Cerner will support enterprise interface planning 
refinement, design, development, testing, and deployment.  Cerner will provide 
commercially available registry selected by VA for IOC as well as details and 
updates on the progress of IOC data migration and enterprise interface 
development.  
 
  Task Order 5- Functional Baseline Design and Development 
Cerner will provide project management, workflow, training, change 
management, and EHRM stakeholder communication. 
 
  Task Order 6- IOC Deployment 
Cerner will provide:  project management; IOC planning and deployment; test 
and evaluation; pre-deployment training; go-live readiness assessment, 
deployment, and release; go-live event; post-production health check and 
deployment completion; post-deployment support; and continued deployment 
decision support.

Current State Review 
 
In July 2018, VA and Cerner conducted a Current State Review at VA’s IOC sites 
to gain an understanding of the sites’ specific as-is state, and how it aligns with the 
Cerner commercial standards to implement the proposed to-be state.  The team 
conducted organizational reviews around people, process, and technology.  They 
observed and captured current state workflows; identified areas that will affect value 
achievement and present risk to the project; identified benefits from software being 
deployed; and identified any scope items that need to be addressed.   
 
VA reviewed final reports analyzing the Current State Review in October 2018 
and discovered there are infrastructure readiness areas that are in better condition than 
initially forecasted and areas that require slightly more investment due to aging 
infrastructure.  However, there were no unexpected major needs or significant 
deviations from the current projected spend plan. 
 
Model Validation Event 
 
In September 2018, VA held its Model Validation Event, where VA’s EHR 
Councils met with Cerner to begin the National and local workflow development process 
for VA’s new EHR solution.  There was a series of working sessions designed to 
examine Cerner’s commercial recommended workflows and evaluate the current 
workflows used at VAMCs.  This allows VA to configure the workflows to best meet the 
needs of our Veterans, while also implementing commercial best practices. 
   
Cerner Baseline Review 
 
VA is committed to align its workflows closely with commercial best practices; 
therefore, VA commissioned Cerner to complete a baseline assessment of how closely 
DoD’s MHS GENESIS aligns with these practices.  In September 2018, Cerner 
presented the results of the assessment.  VA learned DoD has high adoption of 
recommendations and system configuration, which are generally in alignment with 
commercial best practices. 
 
OEHRM Organizational Structure and Strategic Alignment with DoD 
 
On June 25, 2018, VA established OEHRM to ensure VA successfully prepares 
for, deploys, and maintains the new EHR solution and the health IT tools dependent 
upon it.  OEHRM reports directly to VA Deputy Secretary and works in close 
coordination with VA Veterans Health Administration and Office of Information 
Technology.  Mr. Windom currently serves as the program’s executive director and has 
supported the effort at a leadership-level since its inception.  Prior to joining VA, Mr. 
Windom was a Program Manager for the Program Executive Office of the Defense 
Healthcare Management Systems (DHMS).  
 
3 
 
 
To ensure appropriate VA and DoD coordination, we emphasize transparency 
within and across VA through integrated governance and open decision-making.  The 
OEHRM governance structure has been established and is operational, consisting of 
technical and functional boards that will work to mitigate any potential risks to the EHRM 
program.  The structure and process of the boards are designed to facilitate efficient 
and effective decision-making and the adjudication of risks to facilitate rapid 
implementation of recommended changes.   
 
At an inter-agency level, the Departments are committed to instituting an optimal 
organizational design that prioritizes accountability and effectiveness, while continuing 
to advance unity, synergy, and efficiencies between VA and DoD.  The Departments 
have instituted an inter-agency working group to review use-cases and collaborate on 
best practices for business, functional, and IT workflows, with an emphasis on ensuring 
that interoperability objectives are achieved between the two agencies.  VA’s and DoD’s 
leadership meet regularly to verify the working group’s strategy and course correct 
when necessary.  By learning from DoD, VA will be able to address challenges 
proactively and reduce potential risks at VA’s IOC sites.  As challenges arise throughout 
the deployment, VA will mitigate adverse effects to Veterans’ health care.  
 
Implementation Planning and Strategy 
 
It will take OEHRM several years to fully implement VA’s new EHR solution and 
the program will continue to evolve as technological advances are made.  The new EHR 
solution will be designed to accommodate various aspects of health care delivery that 
are unique to Veterans and VA, while bringing industry best practices to improve VA 
care for Veterans and their families.  Most medical centers should not expect immediate 
major changes to their EHR systems. 
 
VA’s approach involves deploying the EHR solution at IOC sites to identify 
challenges and correct them.  With this IOC site approach, VA will hone governance, 
identify efficient strategies, and reduce risk to the portfolio by solidifying workflows and 
detecting course correction opportunities prior to the deployment at additional sites.  As 
mentioned, VA and Cerner have conducted Current-State Reviews for VA’s IOC sites.  
These site assessments include a current-state technical and clinical operations review 
and the validation of the facility capabilities list.  VA started the go-live clock for the IOC 
sites, as planned, on October 1, 2018. 
 
Further, VA is continuing to work proactively with DoD and experts from the 
private sector to reduce potential risks during the deployment of VA’s new EHR by 
leveraging DoD’s lessons learned from its IOC sites.  Several examples of efficiencies 
that VA is leveraging are:  revised contract language to improve trouble ticket resolution 
based on DoD challenges; optimal VA EHRM governance structure; fully resourced 
PMO with highly qualified clinical and technical oversight expertise; effective change 
management strategy; and using Cerner Corporation as a developer and integrator 
consistent with commercial best practices.  
 
4 
 
 
During the multi-year transition effort, VA will continue to use Veterans 
Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA) and related clinical systems 
until all legacy VA EHR modules are replaced by the Cerner solution.  For the purposes 
of ensuring uninterrupted health care delivery, existing systems will run concurrently 
with the deployment of Cerner’s platform while we transition each facility.  During the 
transition, VA will ensure a seamless transition of care.  A continued investment in 
legacy VA EHR systems will ensure patient safety, security, and a working functional 
system for all VA health care professionals. 
 
Change Management and Workflow Councils 
 
Because the program’s success will rely heavily on effective user-adoption, VA is 
deploying a comprehensive change management strategy to support the transformation 
to VA’s new EHR solution.  The strategy includes providing the necessary training to 
end-users:  VAMC leadership, managers, supervisors, and clinicians.  In addition, there 
will be on-going communications regarding deployment schedule and anticipated 
changes to end-user’s day-to-day activities and processes.  VA will also work with 
affected stakeholders to identify and resolve any outstanding employee resistance and 
any additional reinforcement that is needed. 
 
VA has established 18 EHR Councils (EHRC) to support the development of 
national standardized clinical and business workflows for VA’s new EHR solution.  The 
councils represent each of the functional areas of the EHR solution, including behavioral 
health, pharmacy, ambulatory, dentistry, and business operations.  VA understands that 
to meet the program’s goals we must engage frontline staff and clinicians.  Therefore, 
the composition of the EHRCs will continue to be about 60 percent clinicians from the 
field who provide care for Veterans, and 40 percent from VA Central Office.  As VA 
implements its new EHR solution across the enterprise, certain council membership will 
evolve to align with contemporaneous implementation locations.  While deploying in a 
particular VISN, the needs of Veterans and clinicians in that particular VISN will be 
incorporated into national workflows. 
 
Funding 
 
With the support of Congress, OEHRM has not experienced funding shortfalls 
that would impact the success of the EHRM initiative.  OEHRM reviews its lifecycle cost 
estimate at least once per month to reflect actual execution and to fulfill its 
programmatic oversight responsibilities.  OEHRM will provide Congress with regular 
updates to ensure that the program is fully funded and to support our commitment to 
transparency.  VA’s enacted Fiscal Year 2019 budget of $1,107.0 million allows VA to 
continue the implementation, preparation, development, interface, management, rollout, 
and maintenance of the EHRM initiative.  The 2019 enacted budget comprises the 
following: 
  $575.0 million in the EHR Contract subaccount used for Enterprise Integration 
task orders, Technology Acquisition Center fees, site assessments, and change 
management, 
5 
 
 
  $120.0 million in the Program Management subaccount used for contract support 
staff, pay and benefits, travel and administrative expenses, and 
  $412.0 million in the Infrastructure Readiness subaccount for end user devices, 
testing activities, interfaces, and Medical Community of Interest, or MedCOI. 
 
Closing 
 
Again, the EHRM effort will enable VA to provide the high-quality care and 
benefits that our Nation’s Veterans deserve.  VA will continue to keep Congress 
informed of milestones as they occur.  Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members 
of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify before the Subcommittee 
today to discuss one of the VA Secretary’s top priorities.  I would be happy to respond 
to any questions that you have.

Testimony of Edward G. McGinnis 
Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy 
U.S. Department of Energy 
Before the 
U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development 
 
January 16, 2019 
 
Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Members of the Subcommittee, I 
am very pleased to appear before you today to discuss the profoundly important matter of 
advanced nuclear technology development.  
  
As the major source of reliable, resilient and clean baseload electricity, nuclear energy is a 
very important strategic national asset for the United States. It is an essential element of our 
Nation’s diverse energy portfolio helping to sustain the U.S. economy and support our 
national goals. A strong domestic nuclear industry enabled by the existing nuclear fleet and 
enhanced by game-changing advanced nuclear technologies is critical to our Nation’s energy 
security, national security, environmental sustainability and economic prosperity. 
  
Today, nuclear energy is the third largest source of domestic electricity generation and is the 
largest source of clean energy. As baseload electricity sources, nuclear power plants also 
contribute to the reliability and resilience of the electric grid and can provide price stability. 
From an energy attributes perspective, nuclear energy is utterly unique. No other energy 
source provides 24/7, 365-day, 18-24 month full-power generation without stoppages for 
refueling than nuclear power; and no other energy source has the density of power provided 
by nuclear. To put the density of power in perspective, there are approximately 8652 
electricity generating plants, of all types, in the United States providing electricity to our 
citizens and only 59 of these plants are nuclear – less than 1% of the plants and only 10% of 
installed capacity; yet, providing 20% of all of our Nation’s electricity and almost 60% of our 
clean non-carbon-emitting generation.   
  
Nuclear power plants also serve as bedrocks and anchors to communities across the country  
According to a Nuclear Energy Institute fact sheet, nuclear energy supports almost half a 
million jobs. That factsheet also indicates that the U.S. nuclear energy fleet is a significant 
contributor to the U.S. economy, stating that it contributes over $60 billion to our gross 
domestic product (GDP), $10 billion in federal taxes and $2.2 billion in state taxes each 
year.1 Nuclear power plants drive local economies as well, often serving as the largest 
employer and economic engine of small communities. 
  
The first commercial nuclear power plants came on-line in 1969 and the average age of the 
nuclear fleet is now 38 years. Almost all of the operating plants have received approval to 
conduct at least one capacity uprate and to date; these uprates have contributed 8 gigawatts 
electric (GWe) of additional nuclear capacity. Efficiency improvements have also 
significantly increased the total amount of nuclear generation, helping to keep nuclear energy 
at 20 percent of the Nation’s total electricity generation even though the total number of

nuclear units has decreased. This is a true testament of our Nation’s world-class plant 
operators, which consistently demonstrate the highest capacity factors of any nuclear fleet in 
the world.   
 
Of the operating nuclear reactors, 87 have received license extensions to 60 years and another 
three have applications currently under review or pending. Three plants (six reactors), Florida 
Power and Light’s Turkey Point (two reactors), Exelon’s Peach Bottom (two reactors) and 
Dominion’s Surry (two reactors), have applied for a subsequent license renewal to 80 years. 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is currently reviewing these applications. 
Dominion has also announced its intention to seek subsequent license renewal for its North 
Anna plant (two reactors) in Virginia. 
 
Unfortunately, since 2013, 7 reactors have retired prematurely (i.e., prior to license 
expiration) and 12 more are scheduled to retire as a result of historically low natural gas 
prices, and flat or declining demand. While premature retirements have generally been driven 
by market conditions, in other instances, state policies contribute to the retirement of plants, 
such as in California (Diablo Canyon), New York (Indian Point), and New Jersey (Oyster 
Creek). An additional 7 reactors would be slated to retire prematurely had New York and 
Illinois not included nuclear energy in their clean energy policies. New Jersey and Connecticut 
have also taken similar steps to ensure the continued operation of their nuclear power plants. It 
would be incredibly harmful to U.S. energy security, economic prosperity, and environmental 
sustainability if this shutdown trend were to grow. To put the magnitude of this last point into 
perspective, a recent Brattle Group study noted that the total generation lost from the 4 nuclear 
power plants (5 reactors) that are scheduled to retire prematurely in Pennsylvania and Ohio is 
considerably greater than all of the solar and wind generation combined in PJM in 2017 (39 
million Megawatt hour (MWh) nuclear vs. 26 million MWh renewable in 2017). 2 If we do not 
stop this downward trajectory now, it may be too late to recover and realize the benefits of 
advanced nuclear technologies in the future. 
 
Sustaining the current fleet of operating nuclear power plants is a priority for the nation 
because without a robust nuclear industry, we will not be able to reestablish a strong pipeline 
of advanced nuclear technologies and associated U.S.-based supply chains, nor maintain the 
fuel cycle infrastructure and workforce necessary for a vibrant civilian nuclear industry. 
 
Even with all of these benefits, the nuclear energy sector is undergoing a major 
transformative period of time due to a variety of factors that include changing and very 
challenging market conditions, an aging fleet of reactors, and an absence of nuclear energy 
product choices and innovative business/technology deployment models available to 
customers. The industry needs to identify and implement solutions that enable nuclear power 
to maintain its critical role in the Nation’s energy mix in the future. We are literally at a 
cross-roads with our Nation’s nuclear energy sector, and what happens in the next few years 
will be determinative for not just us, but for our children and their children from an 
economic, energy, environmental, and national security standpoint. Having led the 
Department of Energy’s (DOE) international nuclear energy cooperation for 11 years and 
served approximately 10 years prior to that working on global nuclear nonproliferation 
matters, I can assure you that Russia and China are determined to become the dominant

briefs/Impacts_of_Premature_Nuclear_Retirements_in_Ohio_and_Pennsylvania.pdf
  2 
nuclear suppliers in the world. This is far, far more than just electrons on the grid, I can 
assure you.  
  
We are down in the fourth quarter, but thanks to an incredible bow-wave of highly innovative 
and disruptive U.S. nuclear technology developers and game changing manufacturing 
approaches, the industry it in the red zone and in a position to take the lead in a dramatic, 
disruptive and transformational manner; not unlike what we have seen with reusable rockets 
in aerospace, hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling in the oil and gas sector, and smart 
phones in the personal telecommunications sector.  
 
Today, utility customers and communities around the United States, who may be interested 
in acquiring nuclear energy’s long-term clean and reliable source of power for their 
communities, are faced with a rather startling limited choice of only large or larger nuclear 
reactors designed to produce over 1,000 megawatts (MW). These large reactors can require 
more than 10 years to build before generating revenue from power production. Additionally, 
many U.S. utilities and international markets find these GW class reactors simply too large 
for their electricity grids. As long as there are only large and larger reactors, nuclear energy 
will remain constrained relative to its true market potential. 
 
So what do we see happening to respond to this lack of product choice by those who 
otherwise would very much like to have the unique attributes offered by nuclear energy? We 
see the market respond through the emergence of dozens of U.S. nuclear reactor design 
companies looking to seize this opportunity by advancing highly innovative small, scalable, 
flexible, versatile and more financeable nuclear reactors. These innovative concepts include 
small modular reactors (SMRs), micro reactors, high temperature gas reactors, molten salt 
reactors, and liquid metal fast reactors. 
 
The flexibility offered by SMRs and many other advanced reactors also enhance the ability to 
load follow and integrate with renewables as integrated, or hybrid, energy systems. This is an 
important evolution of nuclear energy as the grid continues to rely on higher concentrations 
of variable and intermittent generation. 
 
The innovative design features of advanced reactors also enable new opportunities for power 
plant siting. SMRs and micro reactors are being considered for microgrids, remote locations, 
or even data centers and military bases. It is envisioned that many of these reactors could also 
be placed near or in population centers, with little to no emergency-planning zone (EPZ) – 
something the NRC is currently evaluating. In fact, the NRC staff is already reviewing one 
major innovation that would exempt the NuScale design from the requirement to have safety-
related electrical power for its primary safety systems. In the event of a loss of offsite power 
or loss of coolant, the reactor is designed to not need such power and to passively shut down 
safely on its own. This advancement has the added advantage of allowing this type of reactor 
to provide black start capability. The implications to distributed generation and resiliency are 
frankly enormous. 
 
The innovative design features of advanced reactors also enable new opportunities for power 
plant siting. SMRs and micro reactors are being considered for microgrids, remote locations, 
or even data centers and military bases.  
 
Another class of reactors that is really generating considerable interest are micro reactors 
  3 
which typically range from approximately 1-10 MW. Both stationary and transportable 
designs are being developed. Due to their unique designs, micro reactors may well be the first 
advanced non-light water reactors to be commercially available. And if we think a 1 MW 
reactor is insignificant, we should think again. A 1 MW micro reactor can provide round-the-
clock clean electricity for up to 10 years to over a 1,000 homes.   
 
We are not only seeing game changing and highly disruptive advancements in the U.S. 
nuclear reactor design space, but also in the advanced manufacturing area as well.  For 
instance, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is working with INL and private industry 
to build the world’s first 3-D printed barrel sized micro reactor. This project, which we call 
the Transformational Challenge Reactor (TCR), aims to demonstrate the use of additive 
manufacturing as a viable route to faster, cheaper, and better components in nuclear 
applications. If we can demonstrate its use by printing an entire reactor that achieves 
criticality and produces power, we will have positioned ourselves to truly leap frog current 
manufacturing methods! This is what I call a game changer.  
 
Finally, the U.S. industry is leading multiple advanced nuclear fuels development efforts with 
some of the design components already being tested in U.S. commercial reactors. These 
designs offer real potential for substantially improved economics and safety margins for our 
existing fleet and advanced reactors as well.  
  
I hope what I have said thus far gives the Subcommittee a sense of the tremendous 
opportunity facing the United States due to the bow-wave of U.S. advanced nuclear 
companies, and the historic demand and need for new and innovative nuclear energy products 
and services. Now I’d like to shift the discussion a bit to discuss the role the Office of 
Nuclear Energy plays in supporting the development of these concepts. 
 
Government support through early-stage R&D can help stimulate the nuclear industry as it 
works to address particularly high-risk fundamental technical challenges. Utilizing our 
greatest strengths, the Department is mobilizing its world-class capabilities, and supporting 
targeted early-stage research and development (R&D) partnerships between academia, the 
national laboratories and the U.S. nuclear industry.  
 
One recent action we have undertaken to better support innovative technology developers 
was the release of a multi-year funding opportunity announcement (FOA) to support early-
stage R&D of advanced nuclear energy technologies for application in the existing fleet and 
also advanced reactor designs. This industry FOA is intended to provide efficient, versatile 
and flexible ways by which DOE can effectively implement R&D partnerships to support our 
U.S. nuclear industry. This FOA is a key element of the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation 
in Nuclear (GAIN), providing cost-shared support to the domestic nuclear industry for early-
stage nuclear R&D. In only its first year, 15 awards have been made under this innovative 
FOA, totaling approximately $80 million in DOE investment. 
 
GAIN was launched a couple of years ago and has revolutionized the way my office works 
with industry. Through GAIN, NE is working closely with the private sector to establish 
effective private-public partnerships focused on accelerating the development innovative 
nuclear technologies. The support of the Department of Energy and its world-class 
laboratories is essential to the U.S. nuclear industry as it works to bring forth new innovative 
technologies and approaches.  
  4 
 
The Department is also focusing on infrastructure needs to develop advanced nuclear 
technologies. We have assessed our national infrastructure across our national laboratory 
complex, universities and industrial research centers and have taken action to provide our 
technology developers with the capabilities they need. For example, in November, 2017, the 
Department restarted the Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT) at INL. This facility is 
needed as part of the material and fuels qualification processes. Furthermore, we are working 
to address the need for a fast test reactor. Such a reactor would accelerate innovation in 
advanced fuels and materials for U.S. nuclear vendors and pave the path to U.S. global 
leadership in advanced nuclear R&D by reestablishing this capability. Requirements have 
been developed and an R&D plan has been created. The fiscal year 2019 appropriation of $65 
million will help us continue to move forward with this project to regain a necessary 
capability to test and validate advanced fuels and materials so that American innovators can 
develop cutting edge technology here in the United States. 
 
Furthermore, many advanced reactor concepts currently under development, will need high-
assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), for which there is currently no commercially 
available supply in the world. HALEU is uranium that is enriched between 5 to 20% U-235. 
NE is very familiar with this issue and is now working to demonstrate domestic HALEU 
production capability.  The Department believes that it is particularly important at this 
moment in time for the new class of U.S. advanced reactors, including micro reactors, 
attempting to get to market that a domestic demonstrated HALEU production capability be 
demonstrated, given there is no domestic HALEU production capability and many of the 
advanced reactors will require HALEU fuel. 
  
The Department is also exploring other innovative and collaborative approaches to support 
our Nation’s evolving electricity grid. One such area is our collaborative work with the 
Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy on integrated energy systems, also 
referred to as hybrid energy systems. Optimization of nuclear and variable renewables could 
be a very important way to meet clean electricity needs, and it could also prove to be a 
disruptive step-change improvement for non-electric markets as well. By integrating with 
variable generation, nuclear plants can increase operational flexibility and provide process 
heat for industrial applications, hydrogen production, or desalination and wastewater 
treatment, thereby increasing revenue generation and the overall economics of nuclear power. 
 
There are other actions the Federal government and industry can take to enable first movers 
and help create market opportunities. Federal, state and private sector policies and mandates 
helped create market opportunity for early deployment of renewable energy technologies. 
The benefits of that market creation are now being realized in the form of cost reductions and 
increased penetration. Google’s recent decision to include nuclear in their 100% clean energy 
goal is definitely a step in the right direction. DOE is also working with the Department of 
Defense to develop requirements for, and components of, a pilot program for micro reactors 
to provide resilience for national security infrastructure.  
 
The Administration is fully committed to nuclear energy as a vital component of our Nation's 
energy system. I firmly believe that with a focused and sustained collaborative private-public 
partnership approach to support early-stage R&D, and by working closely and thoughtfully 
together with key U.S. stakeholders, this Committee and all of Congress, we can indeed 
revive, revitalize, and expand our Nation’s nuclear energy sector and restore our global 
  5 
nuclear energy leadership. By leveraging our national laboratory system, and enabling 
innovative thinking across academia and the private sector, we can support industry’s 
development of a new and highly innovative class of U.S. advanced nuclear reactors, an 
innovative and responsive nuclear energy supply chain, and advanced nuclear energy fuel 
cycle technologies, positioning the U.S. for continued energy dominance in the 21st century. 
By taking these actions, we can help ensure that future American generations continue to 
benefit, as we have, from this emission-free, reliable, and secure power source for our 
Nation.  
  
Thank you very much and I look forward to answering your questions.

 Statement of 
 
Richard Ashooh 
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration 
 
Before the 
 
United States Senate 
Committee on Appropriations  
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies 
 
September 6, 2018 
 
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Shaheen, and Members of the Subcommittee: 
 
  Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Subcommittee today to address the 
role of the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Department of Commerce.   
 
BIS’s mission is to advance U.S. national security, foreign policy, and non-proliferation 
objectives by ensuring an effective export control and treaty compliance system, and by 
promoting continued U.S. strategic technology leadership.  As the Committee is well aware, 
current global realities continue to keep BIS at the forefront of supporting our national defense 
by protecting American technology and safeguarding the U.S. defense industrial base.  BIS 
accomplishes this through authorities granted under the Export Control Reform Act, the Trade 
Expansion Act, and Defense Production Act, among others.  There are significant policy 
initiatives underway or being planned under these authorities which I am happy to discuss this 
morning, especially with regard to their resource impacts on BIS.  
 
  Before I proceed, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Committee for the 
reprogramming authorization that has been critical to the Section 232 steel and aluminum 
product exclusion process.  Your support has provided essential resources to assist with the 
demands of this activity, and we look forward to keeping the Committee updated on our work.    
 
I.  Emerging/Foundational Technologies      
   
BIS’s paramount concern is the security of the United States.  Congress recently passed, 
and the President signed, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019, 
which included in Title 17 the Export Control Reform Act (ECRA) of 2018.  Congress enacted 
the ECRA in part to address concerns over growing threats to sensitive U.S. technology.  The 
ECRA provides permanent statutory authority to better regulate U.S. exports, thus helping to 
ensure that the U.S. maintains its technological advantage in science, engineering, manufacturing 
and other industries critical to our national and economic security.   
 
Most notably, ECRA provides new authority to identify and appropriately control critical 
emerging technologies.  The President is to direct the Departments of Commerce, State, Defense, 
Energy, and other agencies as appropriate to lead a regular, ongoing interagency process to 
1 
 
  
identify “emerging” and “foundational” technologies that are essential to U.S. national security 
and that are not currently subject to multilateral export control licensing requirements.  BIS, 
working with these other agencies, will assess whether more restrictive controls are warranted.  
Such license applications would be reviewed under the well-established interagency licensing 
process.  In fiscal year 2017, BIS processed 4,993 classification request applications and 34,142 
export license applications.  
 
The U.S. export control system is uniquely designed to identify and classify emerging 
technologies.  The emerging technology described in ECRA complements and augments BIS’s 
existing authorities to control technology for national security and other reasons. 
 
BIS is reexamining our personnel needs to accommodate the significant new 
responsibilities associated with the passage of ECRA.  Furthermore, BIS has requested additional 
full-time employees for FY 2019 to deal with workload increases in other areas which I will 
discuss.  
 
II. CFIUS 
 
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is an interagency 
committee that conducts national security reviews of foreign investments in U.S. businesses.  
The International Trade Administration (ITA) and BIS play important roles in Commerce’s 
review for CFIUS.  The NDAA also enacted the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization 
Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), which updates and modernizes CFIUS’s authority by expanding the 
scope of transactions that the committee may review to assess any national security concerns.  In 
CFIUS cases where technology transfer is of concern, BIS, as the administrator of the export 
control system under the Export Administration Regulations, is historically called upon to apply 
its expertise in this arena.  BIS will play an important role as we implement FIRRMA, which 
expands the scope of CFIUS review and allows CFIUS to take into account technology identified 
in the emerging technology review process I described earlier.    
 
For a host of reasons, including technological advances and growing national security 
concerns, it comes as no surprise that in FY 2017 CFIUS has experienced a 45% increase in 
caseload work compared to FY 2016.  The average number of CFIUS cases per BIS analyst has 
risen from approximately 17 cases in FY 2010/FY 2011 to 30 per analyst in FY 2017.  As of 
August 16, 2018, BIS has reviewed 204 CFIUS cases in FY 2018.  The resources requested in 
the FY 2019 Budget are essential to ensure that BIS has the capacity to complete its 
comprehensive review of each transaction within the established statutory deadlines and provide 
expert support during policy deliberations on complex cases and rigorous CFIUS reviews.   
 
BIS’s budget request for FY 2019 includes funding for four additional employees to 
assist with the expanded scope and number of expected BIS CFIUS reviews.  This request was 
based upon the increase in CFIUS case volume and complexity that existed before FIRRMA was 
enacted.

III. Defense Industrial Base & Section 232 Investigations 
   
a. Section 232 Investigations 
 
On March 8, 2018, President Trump issued Proclamations 9704 and 9705, imposing 
duties on imports of aluminum and steel.  The Proclamations also authorized the Secretary of 
Commerce to grant exclusions from the duties if the Secretary determines the steel or aluminum 
article for which the exclusion is requested is not “produced in the United States in a sufficient 
and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality” or should be excluded “based upon 
specific national security considerations.”  On March 19, 2018, the Secretary issued an interim 
final rule setting forth the requirements that any directly affected party located in the United 
States, including U.S. businesses, must satisfy when submitting exclusion requests.  In a 
proclamations issued on August 29, the President also authorized the Secretary to grant 
exclusions from the quantitative limitations on aluminum and steel applicable to countries 
exempted from the duties. 
 
Since March, Commerce has been diligently working to implement its exclusion process 
to ensure that duties and quantitative limitations imposed by the President protect our national 
security while minimizing undue impacts on downstream American industries. 
   
  The Section 232 investigations required significant BIS staff to support all aspects of the 
nine-month investigations, which recommended that the President find that both steel and 
aluminum were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such 
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and to 
implement the product exclusion process created by the President in his proclamations imposing 
duties on the imports of these articles.  In response to the exclusion process and surge in 
workload, the Commerce Department has worked to increase and organize staff.  For instance, 
BIS has hired 15 contractors, with two more currently onboarding through the contracting 
process.  Moreover, we have received considerable additional technical assistance and personnel 
support from our ITA colleagues.  With this additional support we have been able to accomplish 
the following: 
 
  The number of requests pending in the initial review stage decreased from 9,976 on June 
25 to 1,218 on September 3.   
  On a weekly basis, we have been reviewing and posting about 1,700 requests and 900 
objections. 
  To date, we have processed 10,380 steel applications (including decisions and rejected 
improper submissions) and are currently processing 25,045 active steel cases.  
  To date, we have processed 784 aluminum applications (including decisions and rejected 
improper submissions) and are currently processing 3,610 active aluminum cases.   
  To date, we have posted 4,051 steel and 222 aluminum decisions.   
 
We anticipate that the addition of authority to provide relief from the quantitative 
limitations will lead to more exclusion requests, further increasing the workload on BIS and ITA.   
 
 
3 
 
  
b. Defense Industrial Base Studies 
 
The Bureau has experienced an increase in requests for enhanced BIS industrial base 
surveys and analysis from multiple U.S. government agencies including the Department of 
Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the intelligence community to 
help support informed national defense and technology policy decisions.   
 
  Under Section 705 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA) and Executive Order 
13603, the Department of Commerce is authorized to assess the health and competitiveness of 
the U.S. industrial base, encompassing the various technologies and supply chains necessary to 
ensure military readiness, emergency preparedness, and critical defense capabilities.  The Office 
of Technology Evaluation (OTE) within BIS carries out these assessments using mandatory data 
collection authority, which enables industry and government agencies to share data, monitor 
tends, benchmark industry performance, and raise awareness of diminishing U.S. manufacturing 
and technological capabilities.   
 
BIS had requested an additional $4.171 million in the FY 2019 President’s budget for 
Defense Industrial Base studies and additional Section 232 investigations.  With these additional 
resources, BIS can begin to meet the growing interagency demand for detailed defense industrial 
base supply chain assessments, utilizing BIS’s unique data collection authorities.  This will 
enhance our ability to gather data and analyze the workforce, financial, production, and 
competitive challenges facing U.S. defense and high technology sector.   
 
c. Section 232 on Uranium 
 
On July 18, 2018, in response to a petition request, the Secretary of Commerce initiated a 
new Section 232 investigation into the effects of the imports of uranium on the national security.  
On July 25, 2018, BIS published a Federal Register notice seeking public comment on this 
investigation.  While we are still in the process of collecting public comments, the future 
workload and resource impacts of the uranium investigation and the potential for further Section 
232 investigations demonstrate the importance of the President’s Budget request for additional 
resources in 2019.   
 
Thank you, again for this opportunity to testify.  I look forward to answering your 
questions.

**** TESTIMONY OF AMBASSADOR ROBERT LIGHTHIZER BEFORE THE 
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS, CJS SUBCOMMITTEE**** 
Thursday, July 26, 2018 
 
Chairman Moran, Ranking Member Shaheen and Members of the Subcommittee, 
thank you for inviting me to participate in this hearing.  
It has been just over 14 months since I was confirmed as the United States Trade 
Representative. It has been a very busy year for our agency. I would like to 
highlight a few of the matters that have kept us occupied. 
  We have been renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement at 
an unprecedented speed. This would be the first comprehensive 
renegotiation of a U.S. trade agreement.  As part of that process, we have 
consulted extensively with Congress as required by the TPA legislation.    
Hopefully, we are in the finishing stages of achieving an agreement in 
principle that will benefit American workers, farmers, ranchers, and 
businesses.   
  We are finalizing revisions to the U.S. – Korea Free Trade Agreement 
(KORUS).  We arrived at an agreement with the Koreans to strengthen 
domestic truck manufacturing here in the United States, allow more U.S. 
vehicles to enter the Korean market without burdensome regulation, and fix 
1 
 
a host of implementation issues related to customs for agricultural and other 
goods, pharmaceutical products, and other issues. 
 
  We are actively engaged in efforts to commence new trade agreement 
negotiations.  After the confirmation of my Deputy United States Trade 
Representatives in late March of this year, I instructed Ambassadors 
Mahoney and Gerrish to consult with Congress and work with their foreign 
counterparts to find future partners for new agreements. We are speaking 
with countries in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa as we move 
forward and start the process of negotiating FTAs.  
 
  We have taken action on two Section 201 investigations, one on solar 
products and the other on washing machines.  These are the first Section 201 
investigations since 2001.  Both cases involved tremendous work to review 
the cases petitioned and resulted in ITC recommendations for relief, which 
the President largely accepted.  And we have seen success as domestic 
manufacturing in both of these important industries has increased as a result. 
 
  At the direction of the President, USTR has been leading the Section 301 
efforts to combat unfair Chinese intellectual property practices.  In March of 
2 
 
this year we published our report and identified several major problems, 
including forced technology transfer, non-economic licensing practices, 
state-funded strategic acquisition of U.S. technology, and cybertheft.  In 
response to the Chinese actions, President Trump directed the 
implementation of several measures, including a WTO dispute, targeted 
tariffs, strengthened export controls, and rigorously addressing state-directed 
investment in critical technologies.   
 
  We are also pursuing and defending numerous trade actions at the World 
Trade Organization.  We are actively litigating 10 offensive disputes, 
defending 21 other disputes, and participating as a third party in 
approximately 20 more disputes.   
 
  In addition to these major initiatives, USTR runs a host of other programs 
and deals with many trade issues day in and day out.  We operate the 
Generalized System of Preferences program and the African Growth and 
Opportunity Act program, we monitor the many trade agreements we have 
in place, we prepare and publish numerous reports on trade, we lead the 
interagency process for developing trade policy, and we work on a daily 
3 
 
basis with our foreign counterparts to reduce barriers to U.S. trade around 
the world.  We have a full plate. 
Finally, I would like to touch on the budget of USTR. In FY 2017 we were 
appropriated $62M with an option of deriving funds from the trade enforcement 
trust fund, a trust fund created under the 2015 Trade Facilitation and Trade 
Enforcement Act.   Our appropriation for FY 2018 was $57.6M plus $15M from 
the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund. We are certainly grateful for the added 
appropriation and are focused on making the best use of it in the few remaining 
months of FY18. For the FY 2019 President’s Budget, USTR requested $63 
million to support staffing increases and focus on priority areas.  For FY19 
appropriations, we have seen the Senate and House marks, which again include 
funding from the Trust Fund.  Given the breadth of our activities and the 
President’s ambitions, we will plan to use base and Trust Fund resources to 
increase our capacity to address the Administration’s many trade priorities. 
I thank the Members of the Subcommittee for their time today and look forward to 
answering your questions.

TESTIMONY BY 
J. CHRISTOPHER GIANCARLO 
CHAIRMAN OF THE 
COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION 
BEFORE THE 
SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON  
FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 
JUNE 5, 2018 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Thank you, Chairman Lankford, Ranking Member Coons, and Members of the 
subcommittee.  I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today, along with my 
fellow colleague from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Chairman Jay 
Clayton. 
For more than a century, Americans have relied on U.S. derivatives markets to 
stabilize the cost of living.  These markets allow farmers and ranchers to hedge production 
costs and delivery prices so that consumers can always find plenty of food on grocery store 
shelves.  They are the reason why American consumers enjoy stable prices, not only in the 
supermarket, but in all manner of consumer finance from auto loans to household 
purchases.  Derivatives markets influence the price and availability of heating in American 
homes, the energy used in factories, the interest rates borrowers pay on home mortgages, 
and the returns workers earn on their retirement savings. 
And not just consumers.  More than 90% of Fortune 500 companies use derivatives 
to manage commercial or market risk in their worldwide business operations.1  These 
markets allow the risks of variable production costs, such as the price of raw materials, 
energy, foreign currency, and interest rates, to be transferred from those who cannot afford 
them to those who can. 
Even Americans not actively participating in commodity derivatives markets are 
affected by the prices generated by them.  Commodity derivatives markets provide a 
critical source of information about future harvest prices.  For example, a grain elevator 
uses the futures market as the basis for the price it offers local farmers at harvest.  In 
return, farmers look to exchange prices to determine for themselves whether they are 
getting fair value for their crop.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) uses that same 
                                                           
1 See International Swaps and Derivatives Association, 2009 ISDA Derivatives Usage Survey, ISDA Research 
Notes, No. 2 (Spring 2009), at 1-5, available at https://www.isda.org/a/SSiDE/isda-research-notes2.pdf. 
 
information to make price projections, determine volatility measures, and make payouts on 
crop insurance.2 
In short, derivatives serve the needs of American society to help moderate price, 
supply and other commercial risks to free up capital for economic growth, job creation and 
prosperity.  While often derided in the tabloid press as “risky,” derivatives – when used 
properly – are tools for efficient risk transfer and mitigation.  It has been estimated that the 
use of commercial derivatives added 1.1% to the size of the U.S. economy between 2003 
and 2012.3  
  American derivatives markets are the world’s largest, most developed, and most 
influential.  Many of the world’s most important agricultural, mineral, and energy 
commodities are priced in U.S. dollars in the U.S. derivatives markets.  Dollar pricing of the 
world’s commodities provides a tremendous advantage to American producers in global 
commerce, an advantage well recognized by competing economies abroad.   
 
American derivatives markets are also the world’s best regulated.  The United States 
is the only major country in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
to have a regulatory agency specifically dedicated to derivatives market regulation: the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The CFTC has overseen the U.S. 
exchange-traded derivatives markets for over 40 years.  The agency is recognized for its 
principles-based regulatory framework and econometrically-driven analysis.  The CFTC is 
recognized around the world for its depth of expertise and breadth of capability.   
 
This combination of regulatory expertise and competency is one of the reasons why 
U.S. derivatives markets continue to serve the needs of participants around the globe to 
hedge price and supply risk safely and efficiently.  It is why well-regulated U.S. derivatives 
markets continue to serve a vital national interest – Dollar pricing of important global 
commodities. 
 
In short, America’s well-regulated derivatives markets are a national advantage in 
global economic competition.  However, we must not take this advantage for granted.  In 
order for U.S. derivatives markets to remain the world’s best, U.S. markets must remain the

3 The Milken Institute found the following economic benefits to the U.S. economy from derivatives: “[b]anks’ use of 
derivatives, by permitting greater extension of credit to the private sector, increased U.S. quarterly real GDP by 
about $2.7 billion each quarter from Q1 2003 to Q3 2012; [d]erivatives use by non-financial firms increased U.S. 
quarterly real GDP by about $1 billion during the same period by improving their ability to undertake capital 
investments; [c]ombined, derivatives expanded U.S. real GDP by about $3.7 billion each quarter; [t]he total increase 
in economic activity was 1.1 percent ($149.5 billion) between 2003 and 2012; [b]y the end of 2012, employment 
had been boosted by 530,400 (0.6 percent) and industrial production 2.1 percent.”  See Apanard Prabha et al., 
Deriving the Economic Impact of Derivatives, Milken Institute, at 1 (Mar. 2014), available at 
http://assets1b.milkeninstitute.org/assets/Publication/ResearchReport/PDF/Derivatives-Report.pdf.

world’s best regulated.  To be the best regulated, U.S. derivatives markets must have an 
adequately funded regulator.  The CFTC must have adequate resources to continue to serve 
its mission to foster open, transparent, competitive, and financially sound U.S. derivatives 
markets that remain the envy of the world.   
 
Today, I look forward to discussing the CFTC’s resource requirements. 
 
BUDGET REQUEST  
 
The FY 2019 budget submitted by the Commission reflects the true needs of a policy 
setting and civil law enforcement agency that has the duty to ensure the derivatives 
markets operate effectively and the public is protected from harm.  As the workload of the 
CFTC has increased dramatically – exponentially – and globally – over the last four years, 
we have been flat-lined in our budget – at $250 million in three of those years – and 
actually experienced a budget reduction of $1 million this year.  Even with the cuts to our 
budget, it is still incumbent upon us to evolve into a 21st century regulator because the 
demands on our agency from the markets don’t stop as a result of budget cuts.  In fact, 
those demands constantly increase.    
 
In order for the CFTC to fulfill its duty to oversee these vital derivatives markets in 
FY 2019, the Commission is requesting $281.5 million and 716 full-time equivalents (FTE).  
This is an increase of $32.5 million and 46 FTE over the resources provided in the FY2018 
enacted budget4 and is the same level of funding that the Commission requested in FY 
2018.   
 
The Commission’s budget request for FY 2019 reflects and builds on the efforts 
commenced in 2018.  The budget request of $281.5 million is the level of funding necessary 
to fulfill the CFTC’s statutory mission.   
 
The CFTC budget request is bare-bones, no waste, fiscally conservative, and mindful 
of taxpayer dollars.  It is based on a rigorous analysis of each of the agency’s functions and 
expenditures.   As with FY 2018, we built the 2019 budget based upon the real needs of the 
Commission.  Each dollar of this budget serves a specific purpose in pursuit of the agency’s 
mission.   
 
During the budgeting process, we identified ways that the agency could be more 
efficient.  Today, we are implementing changes necessary to realize those 
efficiencies.  Departments are being reorganized and streamlined to increase productivity 
and provide long-term cost savings.  We have also successfully negotiated the return of an 
entire floor of vacant office space in Kansas City back to our landlord.  It will result in 
significant savings over the remaining life of the Kansas City lease.  Going forward, we are 
committed to working with the General Services Administration in connection with all of 
the CFTC’s regional office leases upon their expiration.

In all matters of agency budgeting and expenditure, we seek to carry out the mission 
to foster open, transparent, competitive and financially sound markets, free from fraud and 
manipulation, in a way that best fosters broad-based economic growth and prosperity 
while respecting the American taxpayer through careful management of our agency 
resources.   
 
There are areas where the modest increase in the agency’s budget that has been 
requested is necessary to fulfill the CFTC’s statutory mission. 
 
21ST CENTURY FINANCIAL MARKETS  
Today, we meet at a tipping point.  The future is devouring the past, forging a new 
agenda, and threatening to move ahead of regulators, financial institutions, and 
government.  That is why we need 21st century regulation for a 21st century world.  
 
Technology is leading us into a world that is much different than the world we knew 
five or ten years ago, much less when the Commission was created in 1975.   Much of our 
world today – from information to journalism to music to manufacturing to transportation 
to commerce to agriculture, even legal services – is undergoing a digital transformation.  It 
therefore should be no surprise then that our financial markets are going through the same 
digital revolution. 
 
Technology is impacting trading, markets, and the entire financial landscape with 
far-ranging implications for capital formation and risk transfer.  These technologies 
include machine learning and artificial intelligence, algorithm-based trading, data 
analytics, “smart” contracts valuing themselves and calculating payments in real-time 
and distributed ledger technologies, which over time may come to challenge traditional 
market infrastructure. 
 
It is no surprise that these technologies are having an equally transformative 
impact on U.S. derivatives markets.  One thing is certain: ignoring these changes in the 
market would be profoundly imprudent.  They will not go away.  Rather, the rate of 
change will accelerate.5  Nor is ignorance a responsible regulatory strategy.  We cannot 
respond in a reactive way -- chasing to catch up with technology.  We must be proactive 
with a regulatory and statutory framework that is ahead of the curve, gives clarity and 
coherence to this often complex technology, and anticipates its evolution.  The same 
technology can give us advantages in market regulation.   
 
Our task, as market regulators, is to set and enforce rules that foster innovation 
while promoting market integrity and confidence.  To do so, we must have the resources

information-technology.

and tools to keep pace with rapid evolution of the markets we oversee.  Our budget 
request provides those resources and tools.  
 
Among other things, our requested budget will also allow us to address market-
enhancing innovation and financial technology (FinTech).   LabCFTC is the focal point of 
the CFTC’s efforts to engage with FinTech innovation for the benefit of the American 
public.  It helps us keep pace with changes in our markets, and proactively identify 
emerging regulatory opportunities, challenges and risks.  We have situated LabCFTC 
within the CFTC’s Office of the General Counsel.  This allows LabCFTC to leverage the 
expertise of the CFTC’s legal team to manage the interface between technological 
innovation, regulatory modernization, and existing rules and regulations. 
 
LabCFTC has hosted innovators across the nation, ranging from startups to 
established financial institutions to leading technology companies.  These outreach 
efforts are designed to make the CFTC more accessible to FinTech innovators, and to 
serve as a platform for informing the Commission’s understanding of emerging 
technologies.  The information gathered in these meetings also provides important 
insights to CFTC staff on market innovations that may influence policy development. 
 
In fact, through its engagement with—and study of—innovative technologies, 
LabCFTC was recently able to recommend new virtual currency surveillance tools to our 
Enforcement division.  Our Enforcement team has been able to avail itself of this new 
technology and is now able to enhance certain surveillance and enforcement activities.  
This important development helps underscore the value of LabCFTC, and its effort to 
ensure that we are prepared to be a 21st century digital regulator. 
 
In addition to LabCFTC’s domestic activities, the Commission continues to 
proactively work with international regulators on FinTech applications to coordinate 
approaches and to share best practices.  In February of this year the CFTC and the UK’s 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) entered into an arrangement to collaborate and 
support innovative firms through each other’s FinTech initiatives – LabCFTC and FCA 
Innovate.  This is the first FinTech innovation arrangement for the CFTC with a non-U.S. 
counterpart.  We believe that by collaborating with the best-in-class FCA FinTech team, 
the CFTC can contribute to the growing awareness of the critical role of regulators in 
21st century digital markets. 
 
CYBER SECURITY   
 
Cyber security is critically important to protecting infrastructure and financial 
markets around the world.  In fact, it may well be the most important single issue facing 
our markets today in terms of market integrity and financial stability. 
 
As market leaders and regulators, we must take every step possible to thwart 
cyber-attacks that have become a continuous threat to U.S. financial markets.  
Responding to this threat must take priority requiring more of our resources in FY 2019.  
Our understanding of the cyber threat must develop in pace with the constant evolution 
5 
of the threat itself.  As we learn, we must engage in discussions with the DCOs about 
their cyber defenses and threat resiliency and recovery.  It is through the oversight and 
examination of systems safeguards that the Commission helps to ensure that DCOs are 
prioritizing cyber security activities.  With this budget request, the CFTC will be able to 
better undertake its duties to oversee cyber defense capabilities in the markets we 
regulate. 
 
The same vulnerabilities hold true in the case of futures commission merchants 
where customer accounts hold records and information that requires protection.  We as 
an agency will work hard to ensure that regulated entities live up to their responsibility 
to ensure their IT systems are adequately protected from attacks and customers are 
protected.   
 
As an agency, the Commission is faced with growing pressure to protect 
terabytes of data and maintain compliance with the Federal Information Security 
Modernization Act and Office of Management and Budget mandates.  Protecting our 
information comes with a price.  Some of the requested funding will enable us to 
enhance our internal cyber security including implementing additional cyber attack 
sensors and defenses to further protect the market data we collect. 
 
OVERSIGHT OF VIRTUAL CURRENCIES  
 
In FY 2018, certain exchanges self-certified several new contracts for futures 
products for virtual currencies.  These innovations impact the regulatory landscape and 
with this budget request, the Commission will invest more in new technologies and tools 
that support important surveillance and enforcement efforts. 
 
Under the CEA, Commission regulations, and related guidance, exchanges have 
the responsibility to ensure that their Bitcoin futures products and their cash-settlement 
process are not readily susceptible to manipulation, and DCOs have the responsibility of 
risk management to ensure that the products are sufficiently margined.  The CFTC has 
the authority to ensure compliance with both.  In addition, the CFTC has legal authority 
over virtual currency derivatives in support of anti-fraud and manipulation including 
enforcement authority in the underlying markets. 
 
Recently, CFTC staff issued an advisory6 giving registered exchanges and 
clearinghouses guidance for listing virtual currency derivative products.  The guidance 
will help ensure that market participants follow appropriate governance processes with 
respect to the launch of these products.  It clarifies CFTC staff’s priorities and 
expectations in its review of new virtual currency derivatives to be listed on a 
designated contract market or swap execution facility, or to be cleared by a DCO.  The 
advisory should help exchanges and clearinghouses effectively and efficiently discharge 
their statutory and self-regulatory responsibilities, while keeping pace with the unique 
challenges of emerging virtual currency derivatives.

The CFTC has been in close communication with the SEC with respect to policy 
and jurisdictional considerations, and in connection with our recent enforcement cases. 
We have also been working with the U.S. Treasury and the Financial Stability Oversight 
Council.  In addition, we have been in communication with our foreign counterparts 
through bilateral discussions and through international bodies like the International 
Organization of Securities Commissions. 
 
ECONOMIC MODELING AND ECONOMETRIC CAPABILITIES 
The budget request, if met, would boost the CFTC’s ability to monitor systemic 
risk in the derivatives markets by increasing both its analytical expertise and its 
capacity to process and study the voluminous data provided by market participants 
since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act.  These investments will allow for the expansion 
of sophisticated quantitative and econometric analyses that are necessary for risk 
modeling, stress tests, and other stability-related evaluations, especially with respect to 
central counterparty clearinghouses.  These analyses will, in addition, enhance the 
quality of CFTC policy development, rulemaking and cost-benefit considerations. 
 
AGENCY REFORM AND THE KISS PROJECT 
 
Since becoming Chairman, I have made efforts to normalize operations and 
practices, and found opportunities to reinvest and maximize current resources.  That 
means a return to greater care and precision in rule drafting; more thorough econometric 
analysis; and a reduced docket of new rules and regulations to be absorbed by market 
participants.   
 
The KISS initiative launched last March included a review of rules and processes, 
and the invitation for public comment to collect ideas on how the CFTC can be a more 
effective regulator.  The effort has produced a tiered list of significant actions that will 
lessen regulatory burdens.7  Recently, the agency unanimously approved an amendment 
replacing the complex and confusing lettering for defined terms with a simple 
alphabetical list.8  The replacement will remove unnecessary complexity from our rules 
and should help make regulatory compliance less burdensome.   
 
Internally, we have embraced the Administration’s Reform Plan concept and have 
implemented in-depth organizational reviews to ensure that the agency is staffed to 
provide the most effective services to the American taxpayer.  This ongoing effort has 
already borne results.  We are now leveraging knowledge gained from enforcement actions 
and surveillance efforts to enable the provision of more efficient and timely consumer

education materials to the public.  The Primer on Virtual Currency, Bitcoin webpage, and 
podcasts are just a few of the initiatives resulting from these efforts. 
 
SWAPS REFORM 
 
We now have more than four years of U.S. experience with the current CFTC 
regulatory framework for swaps and have learned from its varied strengths and 
shortcomings.  Four years provides a significant sample size to evaluate the effects of these 
reforms and their implementation.  Based on a careful analysis of that data and experience, 
we are in position to address flaws, recalibrate imprecision and optimize measures in the 
CFTC’s initial implementation of swaps market reform. 
 
At the end of April, I released a White Paper on swaps reform called “Swaps 
Regulation Version 2.0.”  The White Paper was co-authored with Bruce Tuckman, the 
CFTC’s Chief Economist.  This White Paper analyzes the range of academic research, market 
activity, and regulatory experience with the CFTC’s current implementation of swaps 
reform.  It explores and considers a range of improvements to the current reform 
implementation that is pro-reform, aligned to legislative intent, and better balances 
systemic risk mitigation with healthy swaps market activity in support of broad-based 
economic growth. 
 
INCREASED EXAMINATIONS OF CLEARINGHOUSES  
 
The Commission expects the number of derivatives clearing organizations 
(DCOs) to continue to increase in FY 2019, with many expanding their business to other 
products and other jurisdictions around the world.  As the number of DCOs increase, the 
complexity of the oversight program will increase.  It is imperative that the Commission 
strengthen its examination capability to enable it to keep pace with the growth in the 
amount of swaps cleared by DCOs pursuant to global regulatory reform implementation.  
As the size and scope of DCOs have increased, so too has the complexity of DCO’s risk 
management programs and liquidity risk management procedures.  In addition, 
increased funding will enable the Commission to enhance its financial analysis tools 
used to aggregate data and evaluate risk across all DCOs. 
 
ENFORCEMENT  
 
The day after the White House announced its intention to nominate me as CFTC 
Chairman, I spoke to hundreds of industry executives at the annual Futures Industry 
Association Conference.  I issued a warning to those who may seek to cheat or 
manipulate America’s derivatives markets.  I said, “[t]here will be no pause, let up or 
reduction in our duty to enforce the law and punish wrongdoing in our derivatives 
markets.  The American people are counting on us.” 9  Through robust enforcement of

our laws and regulation, we will continue to send a clear signal to the marketplace about 
our seriousness in punishing bad behavior and compensating victims. 
 
In the past several months the CFTC has filed a series of civil enforcement actions 
against perpetrators of fraud and market abuse involving virtual currency.  These 
actions and others to follow confirm that the CFTC, working closely with the SEC and 
other fellow financial enforcement agencies, as well as with criminal enforcement 
agencies, will aggressively prosecute those who engage in fraud and manipulation of U.S. 
markets for virtual currency. 
 
In the fiscal year that ended September 30, 2017, the CFTC brought numerous 
significant actions to root out manipulation and spoofing and to protect retail investors 
from fraud.  The CFTC also pursued significant and complex litigation, including cases 
charging manipulation, spoofing, and unlawful use of customer funds. 
 
As of this morning, the Commission has filed 13 manipulative conduct cases in 
2018 - the most manipulation cases the CFTC has ever filed in a single year, which was 
last year (12 cases).   
 
But it is not just about the numbers; it is about making our markets safer and 
removing bad actors from the marketplace.  We believe that to adequately deter future 
misconduct, we must prosecute not just the companies responsible, but also the 
individuals involved in the wrongdoing.  We also believe that, to maximize deterrence, 
we must work with our criminal law enforcement partners to ensure that wrongdoers 
face not just civil liability, but also the prospect of criminal prosecution and time in jail. 
 
In January 2018, the CFTC filed manipulation and spoofing cases against six 
individuals in coordination with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation, which brought criminal charges against the same individuals.  This 
constitutes the largest coordinated prosecution with the criminal authorities in the 
history of the CFTC.  These prosecutions were equally significant for DOJ: in a press 
statement, the Assistant Attorney General characterized it as “the largest futures market 
criminal enforcement action in Department history.”10 
 
I also pledged last year that the agency would look to benefit from cooperation with 
civil and criminal capabilities of other federal and state regulators and enforcement 
agencies.  We have been making good on that pledge.  Two weeks ago, I signed an 
important agreement, marking a milestone in the area of U.S. federal and state financial 
fraud detection and prosecution. That was a memorandum of understanding (MOU)

between the CFTC and individual state securities commissions will focus our collective 
resources to better uphold the law.11 
This MOU establishes protocols and procedures, for the access, use, and 
confidentiality of information and treatment of non-public information in the course of law 
enforcement.  It creates a framework for cooperation that will result in:  
o  Leveraging state and federal resources to support enforcement actions;  
o  Enhancing the impact of enforcement efforts and their deterrent effect;  
o  Encouraging the development of consistent and clear governmental 
responses to violations of the Commodity Exchange Act;  
o  Preventing the duplication of efforts by multiple authorities; and  
o  Facilitating vital exchanges of information and communications between the 
Commission and State Securities Administrators. 
 
Complementing its enforcement efforts, the CFTC has also strengthened its 
Whistleblower Program, and provided whistleblowers additional incentives to report 
wrongdoing to the CFTC.  In May 2017, to further protect whistleblowers, the CFTC added 
protections prohibiting employers from retaliating against whistleblowers and from taking 
steps that would impede would-be whistleblowers from communicating with the CFTC 
about possible misconduct.  In the near future, the CFTC also anticipates issuing its largest 
ever whistleblower awards.  These incentives are working.  In FY 2017, the Commission 
received a record number of whistleblower reports — nearly twice as many as in any other 
year, and FY 2018 is on track to receive nearly twice as many as in FY 2017. 
 
The Commission takes its enforcement efforts very seriously and prides itself on 
being a premier Federal civil enforcement agency dedicated to deterring and preventing 
manipulation and other disruptions of market integrity. 
 
Full funding of our budget request will allow us to continue to carry out our mission 
in the area of enforcement. 
RULE HARMONIZATION 
Soon after Chairman Clayton was sworn in as SEC Chairman, we began discussing 
ways to ensure that our respective agencies are working together in areas where our 
regulatory interests are complimentary or overlapping.  Now, almost eight years after the 
Dodd-Frank Act officially required the CFTC and SEC to “consult and coordinate … for the 
purposes of assuring regulatory consistency,”12 I am pleased to say that both agencies are 
undertaking an active and cooperative review of our Dodd-Frank regulations.  With the 
helpful assistance of Commissioner Quintenz, CFTC staff has been actively engaging with 
                                                           
11 CFTC, NASAA Sign Agreement for Greater Information Sharing Between Federal Commodities Regulator and 
State Securities Regulators

2010).  
10 
our SEC counterparts – and jointly with outside stakeholders – to identify areas ripe for 
further alignment.  Our agencies are also working to finalize an updated information-
sharing agreement that will help us further our collaborative efforts in the swaps and 
FinTech age.  I believe that Congress and the American people expect regulators to 
communicate and coordinate closely on issues where our regulatory interests are 
complementary or overlapping.  I am optimistic this review process will lead to regulatory 
changes that will enhance our oversight efforts while reducing unnecessary complexities 
and lessening costs for both regulators and our shared market participants. 
FOREIGN COMPETITION 
 
As you may know, in the first quarter of this year, the Shanghai International Energy 
Exchange launched a yuan-denominated crude oil contract allowing non-Chinese market 
participants to trade for the first time in Chinese commodity markets. Early in the second 
quarter, China opened a yuan-denominated iron ore contract to international traders.  
There is also talk of China allowing international market participants to trade Chinese 
futures contracts in fuel oil, copper and even soybeans. 
 
China is the world’s largest consumer of oil and fuel and a major global purchaser of 
iron ore for its world leading steel production.  The opening up of China’s domestic futures 
markets to international participation is part of a long term strategy by the Chinese 
government to expand China’s influence over the pricing of key industrial commodities. 
 
The development of Chinese commodity futures markets as viable regional price 
benchmarks for key industrial commodities has competitive implications for the United 
States.  We cannot be complacent about the historical primacy of our derivatives markets.  
Our best response for U.S. commodity market participants and, indeed, for global markets, 
is to ensure that derivatives markets in the United States are unrivaled in their openness, 
orderliness, and liquidity. This requires, of course, that the regulation of U.S. markets 
continue to be of the highest quality. 
 
To achieve this regulatory objective, U.S. derivatives markets must have an 
adequately funded regulator.  The CFTC must have suitable resources to continue to serve 
its mission to foster open, transparent, competitive, and financially sound U.S. derivatives 
markets that remain the envy of the world.  Full funding of the CFTC’s budget request will 
allow it to fulfill its mission to serve this vital national interest. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Members of the Subcommittee, we meet one day after the anniversary of the 
“miracle at Dunkirk,” the rescue of the British and French forces trapped and then 
improbably evacuated in 1940.  That may be the single most important event of the 
Second World War, enabling Europe to hold on until America entered the war. 
 
Like many of you, I was struck by the recent movie about Winston Churchill, 
“Darkest Hour.”  Faced with the threat of catastrophe, Churchill told the nation, “We 
11 
shall not fail or falter; we shall not weaken or tire… Give us the tools, and we will finish 
the job.”  When those tools came (and they did come), they were American tools that got 
the job done. 
 
We need the tools to do our job of protecting the markets that Americans rely on 
each day.  With the proper balance of sound policy, regulatory oversight, and hard work, 
America’s deep, liquid, and sensibly regulated derivatives markets will allow us to meet the 
challenges of the future and ensure a healthy U.S. economy where our citizens can flourish.  
Thank you.

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 
Statement by Betsy DeVos 
Secretary of Education 
on the 
U.S. Department of Education Fiscal Year 2019 Budget Request 
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the President’s Fiscal Year 2019 Budget 
Request for the Department of Education. 
This Department’s Budget focuses on improving educational opportunities and outcomes 
for all students while also returning power to those closest to them. 
Ultimately, this Budget sharpens and hones the focus of our mission: serving students by 
meeting their needs. When this Department was created, it was charged with prohibiting Federal 
control of education.1 I take that charge seriously. Accordingly, President Trump is committed to 
reducing the Federal footprint in education, and that is reflected in this Budget. 
I won’t miss an opportunity to point out that past Federal education reform efforts have 
not worked as hoped. Too many of our children are still unprepared to lead successful careers 
and fulfilling lives, despite billions of dollars injected into the system with the goal of improving 
the outcome.  
The United States spends more per pupil than nearly every other developed country, 
many of which perform better than our Nation on the international stage. Yet there are many 
who, despite the evidence to the contrary, continue to push “more funding” as the answer to 
every challenge. Student success should be measured by the outcomes – by what they achieve. It

93/pdf/STATUTE-93-Pg668.pdf

should not be measured by the number of inputs. That’s why this Budget refocuses taxpayer 
dollars more effectively to benefit students. 
The President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget would reduce overall funding for 
Department programs by $3.7 billion or 5.6 percent from FY 2017 enacted levels. 
The Budget was initially prepared prior to enactment of a 2-year cap deal, which raises 
the FY 2019 caps significantly above the previous cap levels. To account for the resulting higher 
non-defense spending levels in the most fiscally responsible manner, the Administration 
submitted an addendum to its 2019 Budget that includes nearly $3 billion in additional funding 
for a limited set of Administration priorities under the new, higher cap levels. The FY 2019 
Budget request is $7.6 billion or 10.8 percent below the FY 2018 enacted appropriation. 
This addendum restores valuable investments in students, including Impact Aid Basic 
Support Payments, TRIO, school choice, and Federal Work-Study, while eliminating a proposed 
rescission of Pell Grant balances. 
This Budget seeks to support and empower families and expand postsecondary pathways, 
helping ensure students lead successful careers and fulfilling lives. 
First, our request would provide significant new resources dedicated to helping achieve 
the President’s goal of giving every student the freedom to attend a school that best meets his or 
her unique needs. 
The Budget provides funding for this purpose through a new Opportunity Grants program 
that would expand the number of students who have the opportunity to attend a school of their 
choice. Under this new program, States could apply for funding to provide scholarships to 
students from low-income families that could be used to transfer to a different school, and local 
educational agencies participating in the Department’s weighted student-centered funding pilot 
2 
 
could request funds to build on the flexibility provided by establishing or expanding open 
enrollment programs. 
In addition, the Budget requests support for charter schools by providing an increase of 
$100 million—for a total of $500 million—and continues support for magnet schools. We also 
are proposing to expand the Direct Student Services reservation in section 1003A of the ESEA to 
allow States to reserve up to 5 percent of their Title I allocations to further expand educational 
choice, including helping disadvantaged students attending a school identified for improvement 
to transfer to a higher-performing school. 
Second, the Administration’s request recognizes the importance of maintaining strong 
support for students with disabilities. Our request intended to maintain funding for programs 
authorized under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), including essential 
preschool and K-12 formula grant programs that provide basic support to schools and programs 
that support research, demonstrations, technical assistance and dissemination, and personnel 
preparation and development.     
Third, our request creates more pathways to prepare workers to fill existing and newly 
created jobs, as well as jobs of the future. It includes proposals that would promote multiple 
pathways to successful careers while minimizing costs to students and families. The 
Administration believes students need to have a full host of options, including technical schools, 
community colleges, and apprenticeships.  
Students should be able to pursue a variety of pathways to successful careers. To that 
end, funding should follow the student, as they do in the Pell Grant program. The Budget 
requests expansion of the use of Pell Grants for high-quality, short-term programs. In addition, it 
invests in career and technical education, and streamlines student loan repayment. 
3 
 
These proposals also support congressional efforts to reauthorize the Higher Education 
Act to address student debt and higher education costs while reducing the complexity of student 
financial aid. 
Fourth, our request supports STEM education to help better equip America’s young 
people with the relevant knowledge and skills that will enable them to secure high-paying, stable 
jobs throughout their careers. Consistent with the Presidential Memorandum on STEM 
education, our request includes $200 million in new funding to support STEM education while 
continuing to fund almost $330 million in discretionary grants for STEM projects. 
Fifth, we look forward to working with Congress on promoting a safe and healthy culture 
in our schools. Our commitment to every student’s success is one we must renew every day, but 
first we must ensure our children are safe at school. The tragedy at Santa Fe High School in 
Texas was only the most recent, devastating reminder that our Nation must come together to 
address the underlying issues that create a culture of violence. 
This Administration is committed to keeping our Nation’s students and teachers safe at 
school. I’ve directed my Department to do everything within the law to encourage states and 
districts to take advantage of flexibilities in spending the $1.1 billion in new funding available 
beginning July 1 under the flexible Title IV-A grant program. Naturally, the primary 
responsibility for the physical security of schools rests with states and local communities. 
Schools must have the resources they need to improve safety infrastructure, hire more 
counselors, and host more programs and activities aimed at violence prevention. We owe the 
victims of school violence nothing less. 
Our request also supports a new round of School Climate Transformation Grants that will 
help States support effective implementation of school-based opioid abuse prevention strategies 
4 
 
by addressing mental health and other needs of students affected by the epidemic. This funding 
would also support technical assistance centers that develop and provide opioid abuse prevention 
resources that would be publicly available to all schools and postsecondary institutions. 
Finally, our request reflects a number of reform proposals aimed at streamlining the 
Department’s internal organization and improving the Department’s services to States, districts, 
postsecondary institutions, and the public. We recommend, for instance, a number of 
consolidations, including proposals for the Federal TRIO programs and the HEA Title III and 
Title V programs supporting Minority-Serving Institutions, making them formula grants so that 
States may use the funds more effectively. The Budget eliminates, streamlines, or reduces 
funding for many discretionary programs that do not address national needs, duplicate other 
programs, are ineffective, or are more appropriately supported with State, local, or private funds 
— reducing taxpayer costs by $7.6 billion. 
The Budget reflects our commitment to spending taxpayer dollars wisely and efficiently. 
The Federal Government does not – and cannot – know the unique needs of every individual 
student. Parents and teachers know their students best and know how their needs should be 
addressed. 
  With this Budget we can continue to return power to those who walk side-by-side with 
students every day. 
Thank you for this opportunity to testify. I will be happy to respond to any questions you 
may have.

Statement of 
 
James F. Bridenstine 
Administrator 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
 
before the 
 
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies 
Committee on Appropriations 
United States Senate 
 
 
Overview 
 
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I am very pleased to appear before you today, in my 
first opportunity to testify before Congress as NASA Administrator, to discuss NASA's FY 2019 budget 
request of $19.9 billion.  This budget, along with the FY 2018 NASA appropriation included in the 
recently enacted FY 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act, places NASA at the forefront of a global 
effort to advance humanity’s future in space, and expands on our Nation’s great capacity for exploration 
and innovation.   
 
Pursuant to National Space Policy Directive-1, the request provides the FY 2019 resources NASA 
requires for its role in “an innovative and sustainable program of exploration with commercial and 
international partners to enable human expansion across the solar system and to bring back to Earth new 
knowledge and opportunities.”  The request provides the resources NASA needs to lead a sustainable 
campaign of exploration, returning humans to the Moon for long-term exploration and utilization 
followed by human missions to Mars and other destinations. 
 
With the FY 2019 request, NASA is proposing an Exploration Campaign funded at $10.5 billion in  
FY 2019 and $52 billion over five years.  The Campaign is an Agency-wide integrated research and 
development program that focuses interconnected exploration objectives.  Within the Exploration 
Campaign, NASA will pursue a bold new lunar exploration program by employing expertise and 
resources across the Agency in support of: a science and technology initiative; a small commercial lander 
initiative; a development activity for commercial mid-to-large landers to address both science and human 
exploration objectives, and a Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway (or “Gateway”).  The effort is built to 
enable early successes with seamless collaboration across the Agency, and foster both commercial and 
international partnerships towards progressive capability development and leadership. 
 
The International Space Station (ISS) is a cornerstone of our integrated approach to exploration.  NASA 
will use the full potential of the Station to demonstrate critical technologies, learn about human health in 
space, and focus commercial energies on the growing low Earth orbit (LEO) economy.  Starting this year, 
we will accelerate the process of transitioning to commercial approaches to ensure a long-term human 
presence in LEO by the end of 2024 as NASA leads a coalition of international and commercial partners 
to the Moon and then Mars and beyond.  We propose to end direct U.S. financial support for the ISS in 
2 
 
2025, after which NASA would rely on commercial partners for our LEO research and technology 
demonstration needs. 
 
Deep space exploration will require a heavy-lift capability and a crew vehicle designed for the rigors of 
long-duration flights and high-speed reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere.  NASA will test these 
capabilities with the uncrewed launch of the new Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion crew vehicle on 
an initial mission around the Moon in FY 2020.  In 2023, we will use these systems to launch humans 
into lunar orbit – the first human mission beyond LEO since 1972.   
 
To establish a presence beyond LEO in the strategic region around the Moon, NASA will develop the 
Gateway. The Gateway will be a place to live, learn and work around the Moon and will provide 
opportunities to support missions to the surface.  The FY 2019 request supports NASA’s plan to launch 
the first element of the Gateway – its power and propulsion module – in 2022 and will do so by launching 
the element through a competitive commercial launch contract in an effort to both accelerate the 
establishment of the Gateway and enable and further advance commercial partnerships in deep space.   
 
NASA will draw on the interests and capabilities of our industry and international partners as we develop 
progressively complex robotic missions to the surface of the Moon with scientific and exploration 
objectives in advance of human return.  In collaboration with our robust scientific activity across the 
NASA portfolio, these new lunar robotic missions will stretch the capabilities of industry and 
international partners, while returning science and knowledge we can use for human missions. 
 
The FY 2019 request proposes a new Exploration Research and Technology budget line incorporating 
current Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) and some Human Exploration and Operations 
Mission Directorate (HEOMD) programs into an integrated technology investment line focused on 
exploration.  These technology investments will enable new robotic and human exploration capabilities 
and missions, and they will contribute to economic development and growth by enabling innovative 
systems and services supporting the emerging space economy.  
 
At the end of the five years proposed in the budget request for this Exploration Campaign, NASA plans to 
have achieved uncrewed and crewed test launches of the SLS and Orion system; launched two of the 
initial elements of the Gateway (to be complete with two additional launches by 2025); supported 
numerous commercial lunar robotic landings and developed lunar landing capabilities to support future 
NASA mission needs; developed key technologies needed to make exploration more capable and cost-
effective; and established a pathway to enable a seamless transition from direct NASA financial support 
of the ISS in 2025.  
 
The FY 2019 request supports and expands science missions across the solar system while integrating 
science into the exploration campaign and leveraging NASA’s extensive lunar science experience and 
data.  As the Mars Curiosity rover continues to make dazzling discoveries, work continues on a sister 
Mars lander for launch in 2020.  The budget provides for continued work on a potential Mars sample 
return mission, a Europa Clipper mission, and a constellation of operating planetary science missions.  
The request effectively triples funding for detecting and learning to respond to hazardous near-Earth 
objects (NEOs), funding a first-of-kind mission to deliberately alter the orbit of a near-Earth object.  In 
Earth Science, the budget supports the priorities of the science and applications communities with a 
focused, balanced program including funding for Landsat-9 and a Sustainable Land Imaging program.  
The request supports the study of our nearest star with the launch later this year of the Parker Solar Probe, 
a mission that will endure high temperatures while travelling through the Sun’s atmosphere to make the 
closest-ever observations of the Sun and, indeed, of any star.  In Astrophysics, the James Webb Space 
Telescope will go to the opposite extremes--with detectors operating just a few tens of degrees above 
absolute zero, the telescope will look out over vast distances and back into the early universe.   
 
 
3 
 
 
The FY 2019 request supports NASA’s continuing research on new aeronautics technologies, including 
commercial supersonic flight, unmanned aviation systems, and the next generation of aircraft.  NASA’s 
Low-Boom Flight Demonstrator, an experimental supersonic airplane will make its first flight in 2021.  
This “X-plane” could open a new market for U.S. companies to build faster commercial airliners, creating 
jobs and cutting cross-country flight times in half. 
 
The request proposes to terminate the Office of Education and its portfolio of domestic assistance awards 
(principally grants and cooperative agreements), redirecting those funds to NASA’s core mission of 
exploration.  NASA will continue to support other education activities, such as internships and 
fellowships funded by the mission directorates. 
 
NASA’s FY 2019 request supports the Agency’s efforts to renew and sustain facilities crucial to mission 
success while divesting of unneeded infrastructure.  The request maintains vital support for independent 
technical and safety oversight of NASA missions and operations.     
 
 
Human Exploration and Operations 
 
The FY 2019 request proposes an integrated, Agency-wide Exploration Campaign.  The Campaign will 
be executed with the goals of establishing an innovative and sustainable program of exploration in concert 
with our commercial and international partners, to spur a vibrant commercial activity in LEO, and to 
enable human expansion across the solar system, bringing new knowledge and opportunities back to 
Earth.  The United States will lead the return of humans to the Moon for long-term exploration and 
utilization, followed by human missions to Mars and other destinations.  The request provides the 
necessary resources in FY 2019 to support development as planned of the SLS rocket and Orion crew 
vehicle, as well as the other critical technologies and research needed to support a robust exploration 
program.  The budget creates new opportunities for collaboration with industry on ISS and supports 
public-private partnerships for exploration systems that will extend human presence into the solar system.  
The budget supports our plan to deliver to lunar orbit in 2022 a power and propulsion element as the 
foundation of the Gateway. 
 
The FY 2019 request includes a new account structure for human exploration and operations and space 
technology programs to improve alignment of programs and funding with NASA’s new strategic space 
exploration objectives.  This new structure includes LEO and Spaceflight Operations; Deep Space 
Exploration Systems; and Exploration Research and Technology accounts, and realigns some program 
content.  
 
Consistent with the new budget structure and in order to focus Agency activity on exploration, NASA 
also plans to reorganize the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) and 
Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD).  NASA will assess restructuring options (and hybrid 
options that may be developed), and prepare for implementation at the start of the FY 2019 budget year.   
 
The FY 2019 request includes $10.5 billion for the Exploration Campaign, with $4.6 billion for Deep 
Space Exploration Systems, and $1.0 billion for Exploration Research and Technology.  The FY 2019 
request also includes $4.5 billion for Low-Earth Orbit and Spaceflight Operations, including the 
International Space Station (ISS) and Space Transportation – both commercial crew system development 
and ongoing crew and cargo transportation services that resupply the ISS, as well as $44.8 million for the 
Exploration Campaign Construction of Facilities and $268 million for Moon and Mars exploration 
activities funded in the Science Mission Directorate.  
 
 
 
4 
 
The ISS will continue to serve as the Nation’s core long-duration human spaceflight asset through 2024 – 
which will mark nearly 25 years of continuous human occupancy.  However, NASA must also look 
beyond its current programs in order to secure the nation's future in LEO.  Starting in FY 2019, NASA 
proposes a new program designed to foster the emerging commercial LEO space industry.  This program, 
starting with a $150 million investment in FY 2019, will support commercial partners to encourage 
development of capabilities that the private sector and NASA can utilize in LEO.  The budget proposes to 
end direct U.S. government funding for the ISS in 2025, after which NASA would rely on these 
commercial partners for our LEO research and technology demonstration requirements.  This decision 
does not necessarily imply that the platform itself will be deorbited at that time – it is possible that 
industry could continue to operate certain elements or capabilities of the ISS as part of a future 
commercial platform.  NASA will encourage the emergence of an environment in LEO where NASA is 
one of many customers of a non-Governmental human spaceflight enterprise.  On May 17, NASA issued 
a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) for LEO Commercialization to inform NASA’s strategy for 
enabling the commercialization of human spaceflight in LEO and meeting NASA’s long-term LEO needs.  
The NRA solicits industry concepts, business plans and viability for habitable platforms, whether using 
the ISS or free-flying, that would enable a commercial marketkplace in LEO where NASA is one of many 
customers.  The NRA also seeks industry input on the role of government and evolution of ISS in the 
roadmap to commercialization of LEO.  NASA anticipates awarding multiple four-month, fixed price 
contracts, up to $1 million per award. 
 
Maintaining the ISS requires a fleet of launch vehicles to sustain a constant supply line of both crew and 
cargo.  Under the original Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contracts, our two commercial cargo 
partners, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) and Orbital ATK, are providing cargo deliveries to 
the ISS.  Using the space launch vehicles developed in partnership with NASA, SpaceX and Orbital ATK 
have also helped to bring some of the commercial satellite launch market back to the United States and 
have reduced commercial launch costs.  Under new CRS-2 contracts, SpaceX, Orbital ATK, and Sierra 
Nevada Corporation will deliver critical science, research, and technology demonstrations to the ISS over 
five years from 2020 through 2024.  Working with our commercial crew partners, SpaceX and the Boeing 
Company, NASA plans to return crew launch capability to American soil in 2018.  The FY 2019 request 
provides critical resources in this exciting and challenging period as we work with our partners to launch 
the first new U.S. human spaceflight capability in a generation. 
 
Under the auspices of the ISS National Laboratory, managed by the Center for the Advancement of 
Science In Space (CASIS), NASA and CASIS continue to expand research on the ISS sponsored by 
pharmaceutical, technology, consumer product, and other industries, as well as by other Government 
agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.  Through 
CASIS’ efforts, the ISS National Lab has reached full capacity for allocated crew time and upmass and 
downmass.  
 
As we move out beyond LEO, we will employ new deep space systems, including the heavy-lift SLS, 
Orion crew vehicle, the Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) that support them, commercial launch 
vehicles, lunar landers, and new deep space habitation capabilities to be developed through public-private 
partnerships and international partnerships. 
 
NASA plans to launch an initial, uncrewed deep space mission, Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1), in FY 
2020.  The mission will combine the new heavy-lift SLS with an uncrewed version of the Orion 
spacecraft on a mission to lunar orbit.  A crewed mission, EM-2, will follow in 2023.  The FY 2019 
budget fully funds the Agency baseline commitment schedule for EM-2 and the Orion spacecraft and 
enables NASA to begin work on post EM-2 missions.  Missions launched on the SLS in the 2020s will 
establish the capability to operate safely and productively in deep space.   
 
 
 
5 
 
SLS, Orion, and EGS are the critical capabilities for maintaining and extending U.S. human spaceflight 
leadership beyond LEO to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.  In FY 2018, SLS Core Stage integration and 
outfitting (including installation of the four RS-25 engines) will continue at Michoud Assembly Facility.  
There will be a series of EM-1 flight hardware deliveries to EGS at Kennedy Space Center (KSC).  SLS 
will continue a series of EM-1 Design Certification Reviews, conduct the Critical Design Review (CDR) 
for the next mission, EM-2, and begin fabrication of components for EM-3 and beyond. In FY 2018, 
Orion will continue qualification testing of systems for EM-2.  NASA is accelerating the ascent abort-2 
test (AA-2) into 2019, ahead of EM-1.  Structural work is already underway on Orion EM-2 flight 
hardware production.  For EM-1, the European Service Module is scheduled to be delivered to the 
Operations and Checkout Building at KSC for integration with the Crew Module.  Later this year, EGS 
will complete the system verification and validation phase and begin the operations and integration phase 
in preparation for multi-element verification and validation for the Mobile Launcher, Pad, and Vehicle 
Assembly Building.  These are the early steps on a journey that leads American astronauts into deep 
space, permanently.   
 
We also will begin to build the in-space infrastructure for long-term exploration and development of the 
Moon by delivering to lunar orbit a power and propulsion element as the foundation of the Gateway.  The 
Gateway to the Moon and beyond will give us a strategic presence in cislunar space that will drive our 
activity with commercial and international partners and help us further explore the Moon and its resources 
and leverage that experience toward human missions to Mars.  In-space power and propulsion and deep 
space habitation are central to future human exploration.  Development and deployment of these 
capabilities will be a focus of the early-to-mid 2020s, leading to crewed missions beyond the Earth-Moon 
system, including to the Mars system. 
 
NASA is also working on the second phase of the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships 
(NextSTEP), an effort to stimulate deep-space capability development across the aerospace industry.  
Through these initial public-private partnerships, NextSTEP partners will provide advanced concept 
studies, technology development projects, and significant measurements in key areas, including habitat 
concepts, environmental control and life support systems, advanced in-space propulsion, and small 
spacecraft to conduct missions related to strategic knowledge gaps.  NASA intends to perform integrated 
ground testing using habitation capabilities developed by the NextSTEP partners in 2018.  
 
As part of the Agency’s overall strategy to conduct deep space exploration, NASA is supporting the 
development of commercial lunar exploration.  A new cross-Agency campaign will combine science and 
exploration objectives in Advanced Cislunar and Surface Capabilities.  The campaign will focus on 
engaging non-traditional U.S. industry partners and sectors in the space program and using innovative 
approaches to combine lunar robotics, a cislunar presence, and lunar landing capabilities, involving 
commercial and international participation.  For example, the purpose of the Lunar Cargo Transportation 
and Landing by Soft Touchdown (CATALYST) initiative is to encourage the development of U.S. 
private-sector robotic lunar landers capable of successfully delivering payloads to the lunar surface using 
U.S. commercial launch capabilities.  Commercial robotic lunar lander capabilities could address 
emerging demand by private customers who wish to conduct activities on the Moon, even while 
providing cost-effective transportation services for NASA’s science and exploration missions, thereby 
benefitting the larger scientific and academic communities.  As part of the Exploration Campaign, we will 
initiate a series of robotic lunar missions in partnership with industry as early as 2019, eventually leading 
to a continual human presence on and around the Moon.  On April 27, the NASA Science Mission 
Directorate issued a draft Request for Proposals for Commercial Lunar Payload Services to acquire end-
to-end commercial payload services between the Earth and the lunar surface for the Science, Human 
Exploration and Operations, and the Space Technology Mission Directorates.  The contractor will provide 
all activities necessary to safely integrate, accommodate, transport, and operate NASA payloads using 
contractor-provided assets, including launch vehicles, lunar lander spacecraft, lunar surface systems, 
 
 
6 
 
Earth re-entry vehicles, and associated resources. I met with industry representatives at the Commercial 
Lunar Payload Services Industry Day on May 8 and was excited by the growing partnership between 
NASA and commercial companies. NASA’s expanding Moon strategy seeks to harness the innovation of 
American space companies to build new lunar landers.  This solicitation for payload delivery services is a 
sign of NASA’s ongoing confidence in the ability of U.S. industry to meet the needs for delivery services 
in space.  These early deliveries to the lunar surface will support stronger scientific and exploration 
mission activities for NASA, and empower commercial industry to show the Agency what they have to 
offer. 
 
The budget request provides for critical infrastructure indispensable to the Nation’s access and use of 
space, including those provided under Space Communications and Navigation, the Launch Services 
Program, Rocket Propulsion Testing, and Human Space Flight Operations. 
 
New research, technologies, and capabilities lay the groundwork that enhances and enables deep space 
exploration.  Exploration Research and Technology will consolidate the technology development program 
content previously funded by Space Technology and Advanced Exploration Systems, integrating and 
refocusing these activities toward Deep Space Exploration.  This will enable NASA’s outstanding 
workforce to focus on innovative ways to further humankind’s exploration from conception to testing to 
spaceflight.  The Human Research Program (HRP) will continue to conduct cutting-edge research on the 
effects of spaceflight on the human body, including experiments on the ISS in microgravity.  HRP will 
support the development of Deep Space Exploration habitat concepts to ensure crew health and 
performance risks are adequately addressed. 
 
NASA’s FY 2019 request includes $1.0 billion for Exploration Research and Technology to conduct 
research to address needs for human and robotic space exploration and to foster commercial expansion in 
LEO, cislunar space, and beyond.  Technology drives exploration by spanning the Technology Readiness 
Level spectrum, including investments in early-stage concepts and prototypes.  Exploration Research and 
Technology key areas of focus will include: 
  Advanced environmental control and life support systems; 
  In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU); 
  Power and propulsion technologies for exploration; 
  Advanced communications, navigation, and avionics; 
  In-space manufacturing and on-orbit assembly;  
  Advanced materials; 
  Entry, Descent, and Landing; 
  Autonomous operations; and 
  Research to enable humans to safely and effectively operate in various space environments. 
 
Exploration Research and Technology will work with the Science Mission Directorate where appropriate 
on exploration-related technology and research that also has relevance to achieving science goals.  In  
FY 2019, NASA will build on its initial investment in In-Space Robotic Manufacturing and Assembly, 
continuing a public-private partnership approach to flight-demonstrate new technologies used to build 
large structures in a space environment.  In addition, technology development in satellite servicing will be 
aligned to support on-orbit assembly and manufacturing capabilities in collaboration with industry. 
 
In FY 2019, the HRP will continue to implement the ISS flight research plan crucial to mitigating crew 
health and performance risk for exploration.  HRP will complete ground testing of an advanced 
exploration exercise system in preparation for ISS deployment as part of exploration system maturation 
plans.  HRP will also continue to work with Deep Space Exploration’s Habitation development to define 
and evaluate deep space exploration system habitats.  
 
 
7 
 
 
Upon completion of hardware building, system integration, and test in FY 2018, the Laser 
Communications Relay Demonstration project will deliver the completed mission payload to support a 
FY 2019 launch.  The outcome of this effort will prove optical communications technology in an 
operational setting, providing data rates up to 100 times faster than today’s radio-frequency-based 
communication systems. 
 
In mid-2018, the Green Propellant Infusion Mission spacecraft and the Deep Space Atomic Clock 
instrument will both be delivered to orbit as part of the U.S. Air Force Space Test Program-2 mission 
aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy booster.  In FY 2019, both missions will complete their technology 
demonstrations.  The Green Propellant Infusion Mission demonstrates a propulsion system using a 
propellant that is less toxic and has approximately 40 percent higher performance by volume than 
hydrazine, and which will reduce spacecraft processing costs.  The Deep Space Atomic Clock 
demonstrates navigational accuracy improvements (with 50 times more accuracy than today’s best 
navigation clocks) for deep space and improved gravity science measurements. 
 
In late 2018, the Solar Electric Propulsion project will complete ground testing of the engineering 
development units for the magnetically-shielded Hall effect thrusters and begin fabrication of the flight 
units for demonstration.  As part of ongoing work under the NextSTEP-1 awards, NASA plans to conduct 
vacuum chamber tests of high-power electric propulsion systems operating for 100 continuous hours.  
 
NASA will provide a number of technologies for the Mars 2020 mission including:  Terrain Relative 
Navigation; Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment; the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer; and the Entry, 
Descent and Landing Instrumentation, with deliveries between Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 to support the 
mission need dates.   
 
NASA continues to partner with researchers across academia, industry, and within the Agency to explore 
transformative technologies and approaches.  Upcoming early stage innovation activities will investigate 
areas such as breakthrough propulsion, challenges in deep space human habitation, space-optimized 
energy systems, radiation protection, and materials.  These areas are part of a comprehensive approach to 
efficiently support innovative discovery, progress toward important goals, and the development of 
exciting new capabilities.  
 
NASA will continue to engage with the emerging small spacecraft industry, including through the 
CubeSat Launch Initiative.  In 2019, Lockheed Martin will complete LunIR, which will test an infrared 
sensor through a Moon flyby, and Morehead State University will deliver Lunar IceCube to NASA to 
make infrared measurements of lunar volatiles.  NASA will also launch its CubeSat Proximity Operations 
Demonstration, possibly as soon as August of this year, which will demonstrate rendezvous, proximity 
operations and docking using two 3-unit CubeSats. 
 
 
Science 
 
NASA uses the unique vantage points of space, airborne, and ground-based assets, as well as teams of 
scientists, engineers, and technologists to expand our knowledge of the Earth, our Sun and solar system, 
and the universe.  NASA measurements and research advance critical understanding, inform decision-
making, and improve the quality of life for citizens in the United States and humankind around the globe.  
NASA’s FY 2019 budget requests $5.9 billion for NASA’s Science program, including $2.2 billion for 
Planetary Science, $1.2 billion for Astrophysics, $691 million for Heliophysics, and $1.8 billion for Earth 
Science.  The budget ensures that NASA continues to play an important role in safeguarding life on Earth:  
funding a robust Earth Science program, a dedicated Planetary Defense program for NEO detection and 
 
 
8 
 
mitigation, and expanding research to improve predictions and forecasting of space weather.  It enables 
NASA to develop and operate space missions that search for life and illuminate the secrets of the 
universe. 
 
The budget integrates science and human exploration goals, including the eventual return of humans to 
the Moon.  Just this past year, scientists used data from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to 
identify areas in lunar craters that are cold enough to have frost present on the surface – ice that could 
provide crucial resources for exploration while also containing valuable information about the chemical 
makeup of the early solar system.  Establishing a new Agency-wide Lunar Discovery and Exploration 
program and leveraging NASA’s extensive lunar science experience and data, this budget jump-starts 
commercial partnerships, innovative approaches for building and launching next-generation precision 
science instruments, and the development of small rovers that will reach the Moon’s surface via 
commercial landers.  
 
The request supports a vigorous Planetary Defense Program.  The Near-Earth Object (NEO) Observations 
project will continue to fund ground-based NEO discovery, tracking, and characterization efforts, while 
laying the foundation for future space-based NEO detection missions.  The Double Asteroid Redirection 
Test (DART) will demonstrate asteroid deflection technology, and use the kinetic impactor technique to 
change the orbit of a small moon circling the asteroid Didymos, which will be about seven million miles 
from Earth at its closest approach in 2022.  
 
Maintaining a balanced science program and achieving high-priority science and applications objectives 
in a cost-effective manner requires that NASA be committed to – and execute – a full range of responsible 
and transparent program management practices, policies, and approaches.  To this end, the Science 
Mission Directorate is engaging in innovative partnerships with commercial and international partners 
and promoting the use of small, less expensive satellites.  Given its significant cost and competing 
priorities within NASA, the budget proposes termination of the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope 
(WFIRST).  Remaining WFIRST funding is redirected towards other priorities of the astrophysics 
community, including competed astrophysics missions and research.     
 
NASA’s Planetary Science program develops and operates missions that explore our solar system and 
search for life elsewhere, helping to answer fundamental questions about our place in the universe.  
NASA’s Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) lander 
launched on May 5, and will land on Mars on November 26 – joining a series of NASA rovers, landers, 
and orbiters already at the Red Planet.  InSight’s advanced payload will provide unique information on 
the interior structure of Mars, providing glimpses into the processes that shaped the rocky planets of the 
inner solar system.  The budget also enables essential progress to be made on the Mars 2020 rover and 
planning for a potential Mars Sample Return mission incorporating commercial and international 
partnerships– a top priority identified by the scientific community in the most recent planetary decadal 
survey.  In addition, we received radio signals indicating that the first-ever CubeSats headed to deep space 
are alive and well. Launched along with InSight, Mars Cube One, or MarCO, is a pair of briefcase-sized 
spacecraft that will test out miniature spacecraft technology along the way to Mars. 
 
In the coming year, NASA’s Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith 
Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission will arrive at the asteroid Bennu, providing unique data that will shed 
light on the early history of the solar system.  OSIRIS-REx measurements of the composition of the 
potentially hazardous Bennu will also inform the design of future missions to mitigate asteroid impacts on 
Earth, an effort aligned with and supporting NASA’s new Planetary Defense program.  During 2018, 
NASA will continue development of the cutting-edge Europa Clipper mission to fly by Jupiter’s ocean 
moon, and will announce the next scientifically and technologically innovative New Frontiers mission:  
either a comet sample return or a drone to explore Saturn’s largest moon, Titan.

NASA’s Astrophysics program investigates the creation and evolution of the universe and the formation 
of planetary systems.  It examines how environments hospitable for life develop, and contributes to the 
search for the signature of life on other worlds.  The program operates the Hubble, Chandra, Spitzer, 
Fermi, Kepler, and Swift space telescopes, flies the airborne Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared 
Astronomy (SOFIA), and conducts balloon and suborbital rocket campaigns.  NASA’s impressive 
observatories will be joined by the James Webb Space Telescope.  Webb will be larger and more 
powerful than any previous space telescope.  It will be capable of examining the first stars and galaxies 
that formed, viewing the atmospheres of nearby planets outside our solar system, and informing our 
understanding of the evolution of our own solar system.  As we have informed the Committee, based on 
recent information, NASA has undertaken an external independent assessment of the schedule and cost of 
the Webb mission. 
 
Two new astrophysics missions were launched to the ISS in 2017 – the Neutron Star Interior Composition 
Explorer (NICER) in June and the Cosmic Ray Energetics and Mass (CREAM) experiment in August.  
NICER is the first NASA mission dedicated to pulsars – the densest observable objects in the universe, 
and CREAM monitors the cosmic rays that constantly shower the Earth.  The Transiting Exoplanet 
Survey Satellite (TESS), launched on April 18, is NASA’s next planet-hunting mission, searching for 
planets orbiting nearby stars.  In August 2017, NASA selected six astrophysics Explorer Program 
proposals for concept studies.  The proposed missions will collect unprecedented measurements of 
gamma-ray and X-ray emissions from galaxy clusters and neutron star systems, infrared emissions from 
galaxies in the early universe, and atmospheres of exoplanets.  In January 2019, NASA will select at least 
two of these proposals for flight. 
 
NASA’s Heliophysics program studies how the Sun affects the Earth and objects around it, how it 
influences other planets in the solar system, and how our star affects the very nature of space itself.  
Improved understanding of the Sun and information about the space weather phenomena it produces is 
used to provide warnings and better protect lives and essential – but vulnerable – systems on Earth, as 
well to safeguard astronauts, satellites, and robotic missions traveling through the solar system.  The 
budget supports efficient, continued operation and analysis of data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory 
(SDO), the joint European Space Agency (ESA)-NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), 
and the Solar and Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO).  Together, they constantly monitor the 
Sun, revealing coronal mass ejections and releases of solar energetic particles, while also advancing 
scientific understanding of our star’s fundamental dynamics.  Focusing closer to Earth, the 
Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission uses four small spacecraft flying in formation to gather 
information on Earth’s magnetic environment, changing our understanding of how that environment 
protects our planet. 
 
Heliophysics is preparing the launch of several innovative missions.  The Global-scale Observations of 
the Limb and Disk (GOLD) instrument was launched aboard a commercial communications satellite in 
January 2018, and the Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) spacecraft launches as early as June 
2018.  Together, they will provide the most comprehensive observations of the ionosphere – a region of 
charged particles in Earth’s upper atmosphere – ever achieved.  NASA and the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are exploring a potential partnership to use a single launch vehicle 
for the Interstellar MApping Probe (IMAP) (the highest priority in the Heliophysics decadal survey) and a 
NOAA space weather monitoring payload.  The partnership would provide NOAA access to the L1 
Lagrange point for future space weather monitoring.  The Space Environment Testbed 1 mission, a 
technology demonstration mission developed in partnership with the United States Air Force, is 
scheduled for launch in 2018, and three heliophysics CubeSats are being prepared for launch as part of 
NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative.  Perhaps most exciting is the upcoming launch of the Parker Solar 
 
 
10 
 
Probe, scheduled for August 2018.  This historic mission will be the first to travel through the Sun’s 
atmosphere, providing humanity with the closest-ever observations of a star. 
 
NASA’s Joint Agency Satellite Program brings NASA’s best practices to bear to support our interagency 
customer NOAA in the development of critical weather satellites for the Nation.  Geostationary 
Operational Environment Satellite-R (GOES-R, now GOES-16) transitioned to NOAA operations in June 
2017, and Joint Polar Satellite System-1 (JPSS-1, now NOAA-20) successfully launched in November 
2017. 
 
NASA’s Earth Science program makes revolutionary observations of our planet’s land, oceans, and 
atmosphere from the vantage point of space; combines measurements of many different quantities to 
understand and accurately model the Earth’s complex system of interacting processes; and provides 
practical benefits by transforming the measurements and understanding into focused information products 
that are used broadly to improve the quality of life for all humans.  
 
From December 2016 through December 2017, NASA launched two Earth-observing technology 
demonstration CubeSats – ICECube and Microwave Radiometer Technology Acceleration (MiRaTa); the 
Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation of eight small satellites to measure 
rapidly evolving tropical storms and hurricanes using reflected Global Positioning System (GPS) signals 
from the ocean; and three key Earth observation instruments now mounted externally on the ISS (a 
Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS); Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment-III (SAGE-III) to measure 
atmospheric ozone and aerosol profiles; and Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor-1 (TSIS-1) to 
precisely monitor solar radiation reaching the Earth).   
 
In August and September 2017, data products from NASA Earth-observing research satellites were used 
to support real-time decision-making and response efforts by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, other operational agencies, and first responders on the ground in the affected areas during the 
catastrophic landfalls of hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.  Precise, broad-coverage observations from 
NASA’s Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory enabled forecasters to understand 
and track the storms, and to generate accurate flood predictions. A suite of NASA satellite missions, 
including the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, assisted with flood mapping and recovery 
planning.  
 
NASA’s Earth Science program is pioneering innovative partnerships and mission strategies to achieve 
science goals rapidly and cost-effectively.  The budget accelerates NASA’s pilot data buys and 
evaluations of data products from commercial, on-orbit small-satellite constellations; NASA will have 
Blanket Purchase Agreements with at least four private-sector small-satellite data providers in place by 
Spring 2018.  The low-cost, competitively-selected ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer 
Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) instrument to measure agricultural water use in the United 
States and vegetation stress around the globe, and to identify drought warning conditions, will launch to 
the ISS in mid-2018.  Two major competitively selected payloads – Tropospheric Emissions:  Monitoring 
of Pollution (TEMPO) to measure North American air quality, and Geostationary Carbon Cycle 
Observatory (GeoCarb) to measure natural carbon flux processes in the western hemisphere – are being 
developed for flight as hosted payloads on commercial communications satellites in this budget. 
 
In January 2018, the National Academies released the 2017-2027 Earth Science Decadal Survey, 
“Thriving on Our Changing Planet.”  The decadal survey recognized the value of NASA’s Earth Science 
Program and identified a suite of high-priority science and observation objectives for NASA’s Earth 
Science Division. 
 
 
 
11 
 
Launching in 2018, two important decadal-survey-recommended missions will expand the long-term 
collection of key Earth observations.  Making precise measurements of gravity from two spacecraft, the 
GRACE Follow-On mission (a partnership with German research and space agencies, scheduled for 
launch on May 19) will provide global information on ice sheet and oceanic mass balances, underground 
water storage changes in aquifers, and regional drought conditions.  The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation 
Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), the follow-on to NASA’s ICESat and IceBridge missions, will launch in Fall 2018 
to map and monitor land ice topography and glacier flow, sea ice thickness, and the heights of the 
vegetation canopy at low- and mid-latitudes across the globe.  NASA remains on track to launch Landsat-
9 in December2020 to continue the critical land imaging series begun with our United States Geological 
Survey (USGS) partners in 1972.  Consistent with the FY 2018 budget, the FY 2019 budget proposes to 
terminate Plankton Aerosol Cloud ocean Ecosystem (PACE), OCO-3, DSCOVR Earth-viewing 
instruments, and CLARREO Pathfinder.  
 
NASA’s decadal-survey-endorsed Earth-observing satellite missions, along with the research, 
applications development, and Earth-focused technology maturation programs enabled by this budget, 
advance our understanding of the fundamental nature of our planet and improve everyday life on Earth for 
our fellow citizens. 
 
 
Aeronautics 
 
NASA’s Aeronautics Research program advances U.S. global leadership by developing and transferring 
key enabling technologies to make aviation safer, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly.  
With a request of $634 million for Aeronautics, the FY 2019 budget invests in the most critical concepts 
and technologies required to support continued global leadership in civil aviation.   
 
NASA recently awarded a competitive contract for detailed aircraft design, build, and validation of the 
Low Boom Flight Demonstrator (LBFD) X-Plane that will demonstrate quiet overland supersonic flight 
and enable U.S. industry to open a new market.  In FY 2019, NASA will ensure the LBFD X-plane is on 
track for first flight by FY 2021.  NASA also will continue to develop and validate community response 
test methodologies which will be employed during the subsequent LBFD flight campaign.  Data 
generated from flights of this demonstrator will feed directly into national and international regulatory 
decision making processes and timelines, enabling a rule change that will allow civil supersonic flight 
over land.  NASA will also continue to advance new subsonic aircraft technologies that will dramatically 
reduce fuel consumption, noise, and emissions through a combination of numerical analyses, ground tests, 
and flight experiments.  
 
NASA’s request for Aeronautics will invest in developing revolutionary tools and technologies ranging 
from hybrid and all-electric aircraft, autonomy, advanced composite materials and structures, data mining, 
verification and validation of complex systems, and revolutionary vertical lift vehicles, to enabling further 
advances for transformative vehicle and propulsion concepts that will address a broad array of our 
aviation industry’s needs.  In partnership with industry, NASA will complete the Advanced Composites 
project, delivering a variety of computational tools and guidance that will significantly reduce the time 
needed to develop and certify new composite structures for aerospace applications.   
 
NASA will advance electric propulsion systems by flight testing an advanced configuration of the X-57 
Maxwell aircraft, a general-aviation-scale aircraft to test highly integrated distributed electric propulsion 
technology.  This demonstration will address the integration of electrical and power distribution 
components, critical to development of standards and certification methodologies required to enable 
widespread use of this technology.  NASA also will advance the state of the art of key technologies 
needed to realize practical larger-scale hybrid electric propulsion systems for the future.  
 
 
12 
 
 
NASA will demonstrate new air traffic management (ATM) tools that integrate aircraft arrival, departure, 
and airport surface operations to reduce flight delays and increase air traffic capacity and safety, 
supporting realization of the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA’s) full vision for the Next 
Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). Even with limited operational trials at the Charlotte 
Douglas International Airport, technologies being developed by the ATM Technology Demonstration-2 
Project is already showing significant savings in fuel burns and delays during taxi operations. NASA will 
accelerate development and complete the transfer to FAA of key weather-related technologies for 
efficient enroute operations.  NASA will explore new, innovative solutions for proactively mitigating the 
risks of using new vehicle technologies, leveraging the recently published National Research Council 
study on In-Time Aviation Safety Management as well as partnerships with the FAA and aviation 
industry.  In FY 2019, NASA will demonstrate and validate tools which can be used for safety assessment 
of ATM and avionics systems, and transfer them to the FAA and the avionics industry. 
 
NASA will advance the realization of routine access of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the 
National Airspace System (NAS) for civil use by completing flight testing of detect and avoid (DAA) and 
communications technologies, and providing the data to standards development committees and the FAA 
to support UAS rule making.  Additionally, NASA will help support safe, low-altitude operations of small 
UAS through development and demonstration of the UAS Traffic Management concept (UTM), in high-
density urban areas.  This comprehensive demonstration of the UTM concept in the most challenging 
operational environment will set the stage for transition to and implementation by the FAA and industry.   
 
NASA’s FY 2019 request increases funding for hypersonic fundamental research which will enable 
development of tools and methods to more efficiently design future hypersonic vehicles. 
 
Across all of these research areas, NASA investments will nurture U.S. university leadership in 
innovation that will foster and train the future workforce, and leverage non-aerospace technology 
advancements.  Specifically, NASA will continue to see benefits from the University Leadership 
Initiative in which university-led research teams independently analyze the technical barriers inherent in 
achieving the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate strategic outcomes, and who have proposed 
multi-disciplinary technical challenges, along with supporting activities to address those barriers.   
 
 
Education 
 
NASA’s FY 2019 budget proposes the termination of NASA’s Office of Education and its portfolio of 
domestic assistance awards (grants and cooperative agreements), and instead prioritizes funding toward 
supporting an innovative and inspirational program of exploration.  While the FY 2019 budget no longer 
supports these programs, a common vision, mission, and focus areas will drive NASA’s future endeavors 
in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and public engagement.  Through its 
mission directorates, NASA will focus on:  creating unique opportunities for students to contribute to 
NASA’s work in exploration and discovery; building a diverse future STEM workforce by engaging 
students in authentic learning experiences with NASA’s people, content, and facilities; and strengthening 
understanding by enabling powerful connections to NASA’s mission and work.  A small team at NASA 
Headquarters will be accountable for the strategic direction and coordination of the Agency’s STEM 
engagement efforts. 
. 
NASA’s mission successes will continue to inspire the next generation to pursue science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics studies, join us on our journey of discovery, and become the diverse 
workforce we will need for tomorrow’s critical aerospace careers.  We will use every opportunity to 
 
 
13 
 
engage learners in our work and to encourage educators, students, and the public to continue making their 
own discoveries. 
 
 
Mission Support 
 
NASA’s mission support programs directly enable the Agency’s portfolio of missions in aeronautics, 
technology development and space exploration.  The FY 2019 request prioritizes the capabilities, 
operations and equipment to safely operate and maintain NASA Centers and facilities, along with the 
independent technical authority required to reduce risk to life and program objectives for all NASA 
missions.  With installations in 14 states, NASA collectively manages $39 billion in assets with an 
inventory of over 5,000 buildings and structures.  Our focus is on renewing and sustaining what is crucial 
to mission success and divesting of unneeded, costly infrastructure to lower the cost of operations.  In the 
transformation of information technology (IT) services, we are enhancing agency IT portfolio 
management and strengthening NASA’s cybersecurity capabilities to safeguard critical systems and data. 
 
Over the last several years, NASA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has made significant 
progress in updating IT security policies, processes, and procedures to support the ongoing enhancement 
and automation of information system monitoring and reporting.   
 
In FY 2019, OCIO will continue working toward improving NASA’s compliance with the Federal 
Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and the Federal Information Security 
Modernization Act (FISMA).  Additionally, NASA OCIO will continue to implement improved 
management practices and efficiencies recommended by an internal IT Business Services Assessment.  
For example, NASA is continuing to evolve from a highly decentralized IT environment controlled by the 
Centers and Agency programs and projects to an enterprise IT environment that is more centrally 
managed and overseen by the Agency Chief Information Officer.  This important transition, along with 
other internal governance and infrastructure changes, is contributing to a stronger cybersecurity posture at 
NASA.  While there is no perfect, one-size-fits-all tool to predict, counter and mitigate the wide range of 
attacks experienced across the Federal Government, new cybersecurity management tools will continue to 
allow NASA and other Federal agencies to have better insight into their networks, providing improved 
pro-active monitoring and mitigation of threats before they cause significant harm. 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
The President’s FY 2019 budget request enables NASA to develop and operate technologies and systems 
for the human exploration of deep space and encourages the creation of a thriving commercial space 
economy in LEO and beyond; ensures robust programs of robotic missions to monitor the Sun and Earth, 
explore the planets of our solar system, and observe the universe beyond; and supports continuing 
advances to make aviation safer, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly.  
 
Mr. Chairman, I would be pleased to respond to your questions and those of other Members of the

STATEMENT OF THE INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE 
 
Good morning Chairman Murkowski and members of the Subcommittee.  I am Rear Admiral 
(RADM) Michael D. Weahkee, Acting Director of the Indian Health Service (IHS).  Thank you 
for your support and for inviting me to speak with you this morning about the President’s Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2019 Budget Request for the IHS.  This budget supports and advances our mission to 
raise the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of American Indians and Alaska Natives to 
the highest level. 
 
The IHS, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible 
for providing federal health services to approximately 2.2 million American Indians and Alaska 
Natives from 573 federally recognized tribes in 37 states.  The IHS system consists of 12 Area 
offices, which oversee 168 Service Units that provide care at the local level.  Health services are 
provided through more than 850 facilities managed directly by the IHS, by tribes and tribal 
organizations under authorities of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act 
(ISDEAA), 41 Urban Indian health organizations, and through services purchased from private 
providers. 
 
Our budget plays a critical role in providing for a healthier future for American Indian and 
Alaska Native people.  Likewise, it helps us maintain the progress we have made over the years.  
The President’s FY 2019 Budget proposes $5.4 billion in total discretionary budget authority for 
IHS, which is $413 million above the FY 2018 Annualized Continuing Resolution, which was 
the comparison level at the time the budget request was developed.  It also proposes Program 
Level funding of $6.6 billion, which is $263 million above the FY 2018 Annualized Continuing 
Resolution.  
 
Prioritizing Clinical Health Care Services 
 
The IHS provides comprehensive health care, including but not limited to primary medical 
services, dental care, behavioral health services, community health services, and public health 
services such as environmental health and sanitation facilities.  The budget reflects the 
Administration’s strong commitment to Indian Country.  Specifically, the budget protects direct 
clinical health care investments and increases IHS’s discretionary budget authority by 
eight percent.  In order to prioritize direct clinical health care services and the staffing of newly-
constructed health care facilities, the budget proposes discontinuation of the Health Education 
Program and Community Representatives Program. 
 
The budget requests an increased level of funding to address accreditation issues in the IHS 
system and improve quality of care.  An additional $29 million is requested over the FY 2018 
Annualized Continuing Resolution level for a total of $58 million in funding to assist IHS-
operated hospitals that are at risk or out of compliance with the Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services (CMS) Conditions of Participation.  These funds will be used to address CMS 
findings and may be used to sustain operations of any affected service unit. 
 
The budget increases Purchased/Referred Care program funding that is essential for ensuring 
access to care by our patients by providing $955 million, which is $32 million above the 
  2
FY 2018 Annualized Continuing Resolution.  This program provides critical health care services 
through contracts with hospitals and other health care providers to purchase specialized or 
critical care when IHS and tribally-managed facilities are unable to provide the services directly.  
In addition, it supports high-cost medical care for catastrophic injuries and specialized care. 
 
Alcohol and Substance Abuse, Mental Health Disorders, and Suicide 
 
The IHS remains committed to addressing behavioral health challenges, including high rates of 
alcohol and substance abuse, mental health disorders, and suicide in native communities. The 
proposed budget for these services is $340 million, which is $30 million above the FY 2018 
Annualized Continuing Resolution.  Further, the budget provides $10 billion in new resources 
across HHS to combat the opioid epidemic and address serious mental illness.  As part of this 
effort, the budget includes an initial allocation of $150 million for IHS to provide multi-year 
grants based on need for opioid abuse prevention, treatment, and recovery support in Indian 
Country. 
 
Special Diabetes Program for Indians 
 
The Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) provides grants for evidence-based diabetes 
treatment and prevention services across Indian Country.  These funds have been instrumental in 
improving access to diabetes treatment and prevention services for American Indians and Alaska 
Natives.  Since 1997: 
  97 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives have access to diabetes clinical 
teams, a 67 percent absolute percentage increase. 
  95 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives have access to culturally tailored 
diabetes education programs, a 59 percent absolute percentage increase. 
 
These efforts have had an impact.  Diabetes-related health outcomes have improved significantly 
in Indian communities since the inception of the SDPI.  Within our communities, the longtime 
trend of increasing rates of diabetes ended in 2011.  The diabetes program has proven successful 
and has contributed to a decline in new cases of kidney failure due to diabetes of 54 percent 
among Native adults from 1996 to 2013.  In addition, there has been an eight percent reduction 
in the average blood sugar level of American Indians and Alaska Natives with diagnosed 
diabetes between 1997 and 2015.  Improved blood sugar control reduces complications from 
diabetes. 
 
The SDPI grant program provides funding for diabetes treatment and prevention to 301 IHS, 
tribal, and Urban Indian health programs.  To ensure sustained and additional improvements for 
the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives, the FY 2019 Budget continues funding for 
this essential program at $150 million and shifts funding from mandatory to discretionary.  Your 
continued support of these funds is saving lives, improving quality of life, and reducing the cost 
of care across Indian Country.

Health Insurance Reimbursements 
 
The budget assumes $1.2 billion in estimated health insurance reimbursements from third party 
collections.  The collection of health insurance reimbursements for the provision of care to 
patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, the Veterans Health Administration, and private 
insurance allows IHS and tribally-managed programs to meet accreditation and compliance 
standards.  It also allows IHS to expand the provision of health care services by funding staff 
positions, purchasing new medical equipment, and maintaining and improving health care 
facilities.  
 
Access to Quality Health Care Services through Improved Infrastructure 
 
The budget proposes $159 million for staffing of newly constructed health care facilities.  This 
funding will support staffing and operating costs for three Joint Venture Construction Program 
(JVCP) projects: Muskogee (Creek) Nation Health Center, the Cherokee Nation Regional Health 
Center in Oklahoma, and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Primary Care in Alaska.  Through JVCP 
agreements, IHS has partnered with the tribes to provide funds for staffing and facility operations 
while the tribes have invested in the design, construction, and equipment costs associated with 
the new facilities.  These funds will allow the new facilities to expand access to health care. 
 
These funds also provide staffing for new or expanded IHS constructed facilities, including 
Hau'pal (Red Tail Hawk) Health Center in Arizona, the Fort Yuma Health Center Replacement, 
and the Northern California Youth Regional Treatment Center in California. 
 
The Health Care Facilities Construction budget includes funding to continue construction of two 
facilities on the priority list: the Alamo Health Center in New Mexico and the Dilkon Alternative 
Rural Health Center in Arizona.  A total of $80 million is requested, $38 million below the 
FY 2018 Annualized Continuing Resolution. 
 
Supporting Indian Self-Determination 
 
The budget supports self-determination by continuing the separate indefinite appropriation 
account for contract support costs (CSC) through FY 2019.  Authorized and required by the 
ISDEAA, CSC funding supports certain operational costs of tribes and tribal organizations 
administering health care service programs under self-determination contracts and self-
governance compacts.  The budget includes an estimate of $822 million to fully fund CSC, 
which is $22 million above the FY 2018 Annualized Continuing Resolution estimate.  
Maintaining the flexible funding authority of an indefinite appropriation allows the IHS to 
guarantee full funding of CSC, as required by the law, while protecting services funding for 
direct services tribes. 
 
Quality of Care 
 
We are working aggressively to address quality of care issues across our system.  In spite of 
ongoing challenges involving recruitment and retention of providers, aging infrastructure, and 
rural health facilities, we are able to report progress.   
  4
At the Pine Ridge Hospital, CMS notified us that its survey on February 13-15 found the hospital 
in compliance with the Condition of Participation for Emergency Services.  Since that time, the 
IHS has self-identified additional deficiencies that will require time for remediation.  We have 
also made several significant leadership changes.  Following remediation activities, a full 
certification survey will be conducted by CMS to ensure compliance.     
 
At Rosebud Hospital, after satisfying the requirements of the Systems Improvement Agreement 
with CMS in September 2017, the hospital is preparing for Joint Commission accreditation this 
summer.  Our application for survey was submitted to the Joint Commission in January, and we 
look forward to their review. 
 
The IHS Omaha-Winnebago Hospital is also in a transitional phase as discussions with local 
Tribes occur related to tribal assumption of facility operations as early as this summer.  We are 
actively working with Tribal leaders to discuss the status of the hospital and ensure maximum 
success as they exercise their self-determination rights for operation of the hospital. 
 
In the Navajo Area, we are addressing concerns at Gallup Indian Medical Center.  Specifically, 
the concerns derive from a Joint Commission unannounced survey in November 2017 that also 
triggered a CMS survey in December 2017.  The surveys found the hospital Emergency 
Department out of compliance with the Joint Commission standards and CMS Conditions of 
Participation.  We moved quickly to address these issues, and the hospital remedied the findings.  
Efforts to restore accreditation of all services surveyed by the Joint Commission continue.  The 
facility also shifted under CMS’s survey authority for Medicare Program compliance and just 
received a full CMS survey. 
 
We developed the Quality Framework with tribal input, and brought together people and 
expertise from across the Department of Health and Human Services to focus efforts on 
improving the quality of care and patient safety.  The Quality Framework has been a blueprint 
for system level improvements of processes and infrastructure to improve quality and safety 
throughout the agency.  We have achieved remarkable progress in the areas of oversight and 
management of quality, modernizing credentialing and privileging policy and processes (aided 
by new, system-wide software), accreditation master contracts for hospitals and ambulatory 
health centers, development of a standardized patient experience survey, and the establishment of 
primary care patient wait time standards.  Following a year of implementation of the Quality 
Framework, IHS is moving toward sustainment of the gains and improvements with the 
development of a five-year strategic plan to enhance quality in all aspects of agency operations.   
 
I especially want to thank the Congress for the funding that has been provided for accreditation 
emergencies.  These funds have been critical to giving IHS the flexibility to address quality 
issues at impacted facilities and to offset lost third-party revenue, which is critical to the 
operating tempo of our facilities.  The requested $58 million will be used to build on the 
improvements we have made to date.  IHS does not have another reserve of funding to meet any 
significant emergency or emergent issues, and our existing reserves are simply not designed to 
meet a challenge of this magnitude.

Despite all of the challenges, we are firmly committed to improving quality, safety, and access to 
health care for American Indians and Alaska Natives, in collaboration with our partners in HHS, 
across Indian country, and Congress.  We appreciate all your efforts in helping us provide the 
best possible health care services to the people we serve to ensure a healthier future for all 
American Indians and Alaska Natives. 
 
Thank you and I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

Statement of  
      Steven T. Mnuchin 
Secretary 
United States Department of the Treasury 
  before the   
Committee on Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Financial Services & General Government 
United States Senate 
May 22, 2018 
     
Chairman Lankford, Ranking Member Coons, and members of the 
subcommittee, it is good to be here with you today to discuss the President’s 
Budget and the priorities of the Treasury Department. 
I would like to begin by thanking you for your support in the fiscal year 
(FY) 2018 omnibus for tax reform implementation and Treasury’s Office of 
Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI).  The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act is the most 
significant tax reform legislation since 1986.  The resources appropriated will 
allow the IRS to update its systems to implement the new law and provide much 
needed guidance to taxpayers and businesses.  The continued support for TFI’s 
initiatives is critical as we continue our maximum pressure campaign on North 
Korea and support efforts to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.  Additionally, 
funds for TFI are helping to advance the work of the Terrorist Financing Targeting 
Center (TFTC).  The TFTC is a collaborative, multilateral effort with Saudi Arabia 
and the Gulf Cooperation Council to fight terrorism, counter Iran’s malign 
influence, and isolate the Assad regime. 
Turning to the President’s FY 2019 budget, the Administration’s request 
reflects the priorities of protecting and strengthening America’s financial system 
and national security.  We have requested increased resources for TFI and the 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.  Treasury is working aggressively to 
combat terrorist groups, transnational criminal enterprises, proliferators of 
1

weapons of mass destruction, human rights abusers, and other malign actors.  
Treasury will continue efforts to achieve a change in behavior by the North Korean 
regime and fully fund the TFTC in Saudi Arabia.  These funds will also be used to 
implement the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, 
including funding for our Russia and Iran programs, and to target illicit financial 
networks.     
This budget also provides for Treasury-wide cybersecurity protections.  As I 
have previously noted, protecting both Treasury and the global financial system 
from cyber attacks is critical to our nation’s financial stability.  These attacks not 
only have the potential to affect financial markets and the broader economy, they 
also implicate our national security.  In particular, I want to highlight the 
Cybersecurity Enhancement Account.  This initiative makes proactive and strategic 
investments in enterprise-wide cybersecurity capabilities.  These capabilities will 
ensure that Treasury is better prepared to defend against cyber attacks and respond 
appropriately when they occur.   
Finally, as Chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United 
States (CFIUS), I would like to highlight the ongoing collaboration between the 
Administration and members of this body to modernize the CFIUS review process.  
We are working together to protect technological advantages that are critical to our 
national security, while continuing to promote investment and economic growth. 
The policies articulated in the President’s Budget will foster economic 
growth, set our country on a sound fiscal path in the long term, and carry out the 
Administration’s commitment to protect the national security of the United States. 
Thank you very much.

AIR FORCE POSTURE STATEMENT 
FISCAL YEAR 2019 PRESIDENT’S BUDGET REQUEST 
STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT  
The United States now faces a more competitive and dangerous international security 
environment than we have seen in generations.   
Great power competition has reemerged as the central challenge to U.S. prosperity and 
security.  China is rapidly modernizing its military and seeks regional preeminence.  Russia aims 
to restore its national prestige and has shown its willingness to use military force and coercion 
in Europe and the Middle East.  North Korea uses the threat of nuclear weapons to secure the 
survival of the regime.  Iran has been a source of instability in the Middle East through the 
sponsorship of terrorism and exploitation of internal conflict in the region.  Violent extremist 
organizations rooted in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia create instability and 
threaten the U.S. homeland and our allies and partners.  
With global trends and intensifying pressure from major challengers, our relative advantage in 
air and space is eroding in a number of critical areas.  The projected mismatch between 
demand and available resources has widened.  Any American weakness emboldens competitors 
to subvert the rules-based international order and challenge the alliance and partnership 
network that underpins it. 
In accordance with the National Defense Strategy, the Air Force must build a more lethal and 
ready force, strengthen alliances and partnerships, and deliver greater, more affordable 
performance.  The Air Force requires the right size and mix of agile capabilities to compete, 
deter, and win in this environment, brought to bear by Airmen steeped in the business of joint 
and combined warfare.     
AIR AND SPACE POWER IN DEMAND  
Air and space power is indispensable to every joint force operation.  The Air Force’s first 
responsibility is to integrate air and space capabilities across the domains—delivering 
unmatched global advantage as an equal member of the joint team.  We must be ready to 
design and lead joint and combined operations in support of national objectives.   
We have five core missions:  
AIR AND SPACE SUPERIORITY … freedom from attack and freedom to attack.  Air and space 
superiority gives our military and coalition forces the freedom to operate.  Accelerating the 
campaign to defeat ISIS, Airmen conducted more than 172,000 sorties and 98,000 precision air 
strikes last year—over 70% of the total in the campaign—to support Iraqi and partner forces in 
Syria and Iraq.  In the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, the Air Force executed a sustained air 
interdiction campaign of over 4,000 sorties to support Afghan partners, targeting Taliban so-
called safe zones, command and control nodes, illicit revenue-generating ventures, and

Air Force Posture 
 
logistical networks.  In space, the Air Force operates 6 constellations and 12 satellite systems 
vital to national security that provide communications, command and control, missile warning, 
nuclear detonation detection, weather, and GPS for the world.  In 2017, the Air Force 
supported 28 space launches from our facilities at Vandenberg and Cape Canaveral, a 40% 
increase from 2016.  We are planning 45 launches in 2018, sending both national security 
payloads and an increasing number of commercial payloads into orbit. 
GLOBAL STRIKE … any target, any time.  Airmen maintain the continuous alert of our missile 
forces.  Last year, Airmen conducted 16,425 intercontinental ballistic missile alert tours and 248 
missile convoys across 3 missile wings and 5 states.  Our bombers flew 580 missions in the Indo-
Pacific, strengthening security and stability in the region and reassuring our partners.  
Reinforcing NATO’s eastern flank, American bombers flew 70 assurance and deterrence 
missions.   
RAPID GLOBAL MOBILITY … delivery on demand.  In 2017, Airmen transported nearly 1 million 
personnel, the equivalent of moving the population of Montana, and delivered over 738 million 
pounds of warfighting equipment and humanitarian supplies, the weight of 82 U.S. Capitol 
Domes.  Our tanker force extended joint power projection at intercontinental distances by 
passing more than 1 billion pounds of fuel in-flight, which could fill the Rose Bowl to the top, 
while aeromedical evacuation Airmen airlifted more than 5,000 patients to safety.  Closer to 
home, Airmen delivered 13,600 short tons of relief supplies following the string of record-
setting hurricanes, and helped combat multiple wild fires in the western United States.   
INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE (ISR) … global eyes and ears on 
adversaries.  Last year, the Air Force was tasked with nearly 25,000 ISR missions, collected 
340,000 hours of full motion video, and produced 2.55 million intelligence products—which 
averages almost 5 products every minute that close intelligence gaps and support target 
analysis and development.  Persistent ISR closely tied to precision weapons from the ground 
and air has been a linchpin element in the destruction of ISIS.    
COMMAND AND CONTROL … right info, right person, right time.  Last year, our E4-B National 
Airborne Operations Center—the survivable mobile command center—conducted 53 alert 
tours and provided travel support to the Secretary of Defense.  Our E-8C Joint Surveillance 
Target Attack Radar System flew over 5,000 hours, enabling a range of support for Combatant 
Commanders from command and control in the ISIS campaign to the interdiction of over 12,500 
kilograms of illicit drugs before they entered our Nation’s borders.  The E-3 Airborne Warning 
and Control System was integral to coordinating search and rescue efforts during the 2017 
hurricane season.  
Increasingly, we are conducting these missions with allies and partners.  The Air Force engaged 
in more than 85 exercises with international partners last year, including five focused on high-
end combat.  We furthered the international role of the F-35, training with partners in both 
Europe and South Korea, and began delivery of F-35s to Israel, Norway, and Italy.  We 
concluded 42 International Arms Cooperation agreements worth $2.95 billion, including a cost-
sharing agreement that launched the ninth Wideband Global SATCOM satellite which enables 
   
Page 8
   
 
 
Air Force Posture 
 
international partners access to shared high-capacity global communications.  In 2017, Foreign 
Military Sales expanded nearly three-fold from the year prior to $22.7 billion.  These sales 
strengthen the United States' position as the security cooperation partner of choice, and 
expand interoperable airpower. 
STRATEGIC DIRECTION 
The Air Force budget request of $156.3 billion for Fiscal Year 2019 builds on the progress made 
in 2018 to restore the readiness of the force, increase lethality, and cost-effectively modernize.  
Sustaining these efforts requires predictable budgets at the requested funding levels. 
In alignment with the National Defense Strategy, this budget prioritizes long-term competition 
with China and Russia.   
This budget moves the Air Force in the direction of multi-domain operations.  Future wars will 
be won by those who observe, orient, decide, and act faster than adversaries in an integrated 
way across domains—land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace.   
The squadron remains the foundational fighting unit of the Air Force.  The Air Force currently 
has 301 front line operational squadrons1 to execute our core missions, supported by squadrons 
that directly enable the fight and provide reachback capability.  Based on the new National 
Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, and Nuclear Posture Review, the Air Force is in the 
process of determining how many squadrons we need to deliver the combat capability required 
to execute the new defense strategy.    
CONTINUING EFFORTS 
Some elements of this budget continue programs and strategies that are well established: 
READINESS:  Restoring readiness to win any fight, any time remains a primary objective.  The 
budget funds 1.5 million flying hours—1.2 million executable peacetime training flying hours 
and 300,000 flying hours supporting overseas contingency operations—at a cost of $8.7 billion.  
We propose to buy 54,443 preferred munitions to reverse previous declining inventories at a 
cost of $1.8 billion.  This budget also funds training ranges, simulators, instructors, and key 
infrastructure required to improve the quality of our training in alignment with the National 
Defense Strategy prioritization of peer competition. 
PEOPLE:  The FY19 budget proposal represents an increase in the size of the Air Force by 4,700 
Airmen. 2  Our five-year plan calls for achievable, steady growth to approximately 339,000 active 
duty Airmen while we simultaneously review existing manning across the active duty, guard, 
and reserve components.  In addition, this budget submission funds important support to 
Airmen and families with a 2.6% military pay raise, increased housing and subsistence 
                                                           
1 Fighters, bombers, airlift, intelligence/surveillance/reconnaissance, command and control, special 
operations, space, cyber, missile, and personnel recovery squadrons are counted here. 
2 Total Force number including active duty, guard, and reserve.

Air Force Posture 
 
allowances, and family support programs.  We will invest in purposeful development of Airmen 
to strengthen our joint warfighting excellence—integrating education, training, and experience 
for our leaders and teams.  
NUCLEAR DETERRENCE:  Our budget proposal supports the Defense Department’s principal 
priority to maintain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent that safeguards the 
homeland, assures allies, and deters adversaries.  The budget improves our nuclear command, 
control, and communication systems as directed in the Nuclear Posture Review.  It initiates 
development of B-52 replacement engines, continues development of the Long Range Stand Off 
missile, and continues development of the replacement for the Minuteman III intercontinental 
ballistic missile.    
MODERNIZATION:  The budget funds our priority modernization initiatives with the purchase of 
48 F-35 fighters, 15 KC-46 tankers, and continued development of the B-21 bomber.  This year, 
we will decide the new T-X advanced trainer aircraft and the replacement for the UH-1 
helicopter.  Critical to mission success is continued investment in our classified portfolio, which 
will be briefed in a closed session. 
CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY 
Some elements of this budget reflect a change to confront the reemergence of great power 
competition:  
SPACE SUPERIORITY:  The FY19 budget represents a 33% increase from last year in the research, 
development, test, and experimentation budget for Air Force Space to meet the threat from 
China and Russia.  We will build more jam-resistant GPS satellites, improve missile warning, 
improve space situational awareness, and increase our ability to defend our Nation’s most vital 
assets on orbit.  We are taking advantage of changes in legislative authorities to return program 
decision authorities back to the Air Force, including 14 of the 19 Major Defense Acquisition 
Programs within the space portfolio.  Using tools such as the Defense Acquisition Workforce 
Development Fund, we are investing in our people, ensuring they have the right skills and 
training to succeed. 
MULTI-DOMAIN COMMAND AND CONTROL:  Technological advances are changing the character 
of warfare.  The budget proposes to change the way we execute battlefield management 
command and control in the multi-domain environment.  We propose to modernize 7 E-3 
Airborne Warning and Control aircraft (AWACS) and keep the current E-8C Joint Surveillance 
Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) operational through the mid-2020s, as we develop and 
transition to an advanced battle management system.  This approach will integrate space, air, 
and ground based sensors on manned and unmanned platforms and satellites to meet more 
combatant commander requirements in both contested and non-contested environments.   
AIR SUPERIORITY:  Central to lethality is our ability to gain and maintain air superiority when and 
where needed against potential adversaries in 2030 and beyond.  Over the next five years, we 
will develop an integrated family of systems that can establish and maintain air superiority in a 
   
Page 10
   
 
 
Air Force Posture 
 
contested environment.  The FY19 budget includes $11.0 billion as part of a $63.8 billion effort 
over the five-year plan.  This will be a multi-domain effort with a renewed emphasis on 
electronic warfare, networked capabilities, and control of the electromagnetic spectrum.  
LIGHT ATTACK:  Retaining irregular warfare as a core competency at a lower cost, and 
strengthening our alliances are key elements of our National Defense Strategy.   The Air Force 
proposes to continue the light attack experiment, developing concepts of operation and further 
defining requirements in preparation for fielding a force of U.S. light attack aircraft during this 
five-year plan.  We are focusing on rapid fielding and rapid procurement strategies that leverage 
existing capabilities with little or no development.  Designed to be coalition at the core, we will 
invite and lead allies and partners to train in the U.S., buy common equipment for their own 
affordable light attack squadrons, and build those international squadrons on a network that 
shares information.   
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY:  The Air Force launched a review of our science and technology 
strategy that will be complete later this year.  This budget increases emphasis on basic and 
applied research to drive long-term innovation and dominance in air and space power. 
BUDGET PRIORITIES  
IMPROVING WARFIGHTING READINESS:  Readiness is first and foremost about having enough 
trained people.  We continue to address the aircrew shortage through a multi-pronged 
approach.  This budget boosts pipeline capacity, expands pilot training and addresses 
experience shortfalls, continues incentive pay and bonuses, improves administrative support at 
the squadron level, and funds flying hours to executable levels.  It also addresses gaps in space, 
nuclear, cyber, and intelligence career fields, and supports Battlefield Airmen, our air-to-ground 
integration force.   
The budget proposal funds aircraft depot maintenance, parts, logistics support, and invests $2.8 
billion in operational training infrastructure needed for relevant, realistic training for the multi-
domain environment.  It fully funds preferred munitions to industry capacity.  This includes 
Hellfire missiles, Joint Direct Attack Munition bombs, the Small Diameter Bomb, and the 
Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System. 
The Air Force recruits Airmen, but we retain families.  To improve family support, the budget 
funds expanded childcare hours, increases off-base child care support, and funds more respite 
care and support coordinators for special needs families.  We are improving the assignment 
system so families can better plan for future assignments, sustaining our morale and resilience 
programs, and implementing initiatives that support unit cohesion in our squadrons. 
The Air Force is also significantly changing the way we collect operational tempo metrics.  Prior 
methods underreport how much time Airmen are away.  By now accounting for temporary 
duties away from home station for training exercises or mission-related requirements in 
addition to deployment time, we more accurately capture the true impact of service demands 
on Airmen, families, and home units. 
   
Page 11
   
 
 
Air Force Posture 
 
SAFE, SECURE, AND EFFECTIVE NUCLEAR DETERRENT:   Deterrence works if our adversaries know 
that we can hold at risk things they value.  We must concurrently modernize the entire nuclear 
triad and the command and control systems that enable its effectiveness.  The Air Force 
stewards two legs of the triad and operates 75% of the Defense Department’s nuclear 
command, control, and communication (NC3) capabilities.   
Modernizing the air-based leg of the nuclear triad, the budget continues development of the 
replacement air-launched cruise missile, which is 25 years past its design life and faces 
improving adversary air defense systems.  This weapon will equip the B-52, B-2, and 
forthcoming B-21 bombers to maintain flexible and effective stand-off capability that can 
penetrate and survive the most challenging environments.  
This budget continues to update the B-52 bomber fleet and funds development of replacement 
engines.  With adequate sustainment and modernization, including new engines, the B-52 will 
remain a key part of the bomber enterprise well into the future.  Additionally, the budget 
proposal begins to replace our Vietnam-era UH-1N helicopter. 
The budget moves forward modernization of the ground-based leg of the nuclear triad.  The 
Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program will replace the retiring Minuteman III, which has 
remained viable four decades past its design life through a series of costly service life 
extensions, but cannot be extended further beyond 2030.    
Today’s nuclear command, control, and communications system was last comprehensively 
updated almost three decades ago.  The budget targets investments to modernize the 
integrated land, air, and space-based systems to ensure secure, survivable connectivity with the 
President and national command leadership. 
COST-EFFECTIVE MODERNIZATION:  Underfunded in modernization for over a decade, the Air 
Force must manage a bow wave in modernization over the next ten years. 
The budget proposes to upgrade F-16 and F-15 C/D aircraft to retain affordable capacity.  We 
propose to buy 48 F-35A aircraft in FY19 and 258 F-35A aircraft over the next five years.  The   
F-35A fighter brings unparalleled global precision attack capability.  The Air Force will integrate 
the F-35 with fourth-generation aircraft as well as space and unmanned aircraft, to maintain air 
superiority in highly contested environments. 
Tanker recapitalization remains a top acquisition priority.  The multi-role KC-46 is capable of 
refueling joint and coalition aircraft with both boom and drogue in the same sortie, and 
augments the airlift fleet with improved cargo, passenger, and aeromedical evacuation 
capabilities.  This budget proposes to buy 15 more KC-46 tankers in FY19.    
Our budget proposal continues to develop the B-21 bomber as a key component to the joint 
portfolio of conventional and nuclear deep-strike capabilities.  The B-21 will be able to deliver 
both gravity bombs and the Long Range Stand Off missile, ensuring options for our Nation’s 
leaders to hold targets at risk around the world.

Air Force Posture 
 
MOVING FASTER TO DEFENDABLE SPACE:  The FY19 budget accelerates our efforts to deter, 
defend, and prevail against anyone who seeks to deny our ability to freely operate in space.  
The budget recognizes that adversaries are developing the ability to deny our free use of space 
and includes capabilities to confront that threat.  The development of these capabilities will 
continue over the future years defense plan and beyond. 
Foregoing the continued buy of today’s Space Based Infrared System satellites 7 and 8, the Air 
Force will develop the next-generation Overhead Persistent Infrared system.  This system will 
detect and report on current, emerging, and anticipated threats, and will be designed for 
survivability.   
The budget adds resilience features and user protection to the Advanced Extremely High 
Frequency and Wideband Global Satellite Communications systems, and continues to fund 
development of next-generation protected satellite communications services for both strategic 
and operational military users.  We continue to explore more affordable and innovative ways to 
acquire satellite communications services with investment in both commercial industry and 
international partner capabilities. 
The budget proposal increases funding for anti-jam, anti-spoof, and anti-tamper military GPS 
development and integration into multiple joint platforms, and continues to grow Space 
Situational Awareness and Space Control capabilities to enhance our ability to identify, 
characterize, and attribute threatening actions.  The budget also funds a Weather Satellite 
Follow-on program using rapid acquisition authorities. 
Building upon the foundational architecture for space warfighting, we will deliver highly 
responsive capabilities to connect tactical and operational systems to strategic-level decision 
makers.  The recent stand-up of the National Space Defense Center supports this mission.  The 
budget also funds the Standard Space Trainer that provides realistic, live, virtual, constructive 
training to prepare our Space Mission Force Airmen to prevail in a contested space domain. 
NETWORKED BATTLE MANAGEMENT:  Integrating capabilities that span all domains of warfare 
will be required for success in future combat.  With the other Services, we are shifting from a 
model of interdependence to one of integration, which includes better integrated 
communications systems, development of tailorable units, and policies in key areas that enable 
adaptability and innovation.  Concurrently, we will advance our command and control systems 
to reflect the changing character of warfare. 
The Air Force capability that delivers persistent battle management command and control and 
ground moving target indications to joint warfighters is in high global demand that far exceeds 
supply.  We currently conduct battlefield command and control from JSTARS, AWACS, 
Combined Air Operations Centers, Tactical Operations Centers, and mobile Control and 
Reporting Centers, and monitor many targets on the ground from JSTARS, Global Hawk, and 
other unmanned aerial systems.  We had planned to recapitalize our aging fleet of E-8C JSTARS 
on a newer aircraft, however, we believe that system will not be viable in future contested 
environments and the recapitalization plan brought no additional capability or capacity to meet 
   
Page 13
   
 
 
Air Force Posture 
 
future demands despite over $15 billion in total lifecycle costs.  In developing an alternative 
approach that will meet more warfighter needs, we propose to keep the current E-8C JSTARS 
operational through mid-2020s and replace the recapitalization program as we transition to an 
advanced battle management system for the future.  This approach, as directed in the National 
Defense Strategy, will network sensors from space, air, land, and sea, and fuse information to 
create a more comprehensive picture to support the joint fight, even in a contested 
environment.  
STRENGTHENING ALLIANCES:  The National Defense Strategy emphasizes the importance of 
alliances and partnerships. The FY19 budget reinforces the Air Force commitment to our allies 
and international partners through programs such as the European Deterrence Initiative and 
Indo-Pacific security initiatives.  
REFORMING THE DEPARTMENT 
While this budget proposes additional resources for the Air Force, we have to gain full value 
from every taxpayer dollar we spend.  We will drive innovation, reinforce budget discipline and 
affordability, and deliver performance with the funds entrusted to us.  
ZERO-BASED REVIEW:  For the first time in more than two decades, we are conducting a zero-
based review of all Air Force programs, budget accounts, and manpower authorizations to 
prepare for FY20 and the future years defense plan.  We will examine the relevance of every 
requirement and program to align with the new defense strategy.  Everything we do is “on the 
table” during this review. 
HEADQUARTERS AIR FORCE STAFF REVIEW:  Simultaneously, we are reviewing the structure and 
manning of the Headquarters Air Force staff.   We are the smallest and most integrated of the 
service staffs and intend to stay that way.  We will ensure each position is used efficiently and 
effectively to support the warfighter. 
ACQUISITION:  Enabled by the FY16 and FY17 National Defense Authorization Acts, we are 
streamlining Air Force acquisition.  We have milestone decision authority for more programs 
and we are pushing authority to run programs down to lower levels and using new techniques 
to innovate, including rapid prototyping and experimentation.  We appreciate Congress’ 
continued support of the Acquisition Workforce Development fund and expedited hiring 
authorities to attract, recruit, hire, develop, and retain a high-quality workforce.   
STREAMLINING:  We are systematically reviewing, reducing, and clarifying onerous internal 
instructions, additional duties, and computer-based training.  There are over 1,300 Air Force 
instructions that levy 85,000 requirements on our wings and squadrons.  Every one of them will 
be reviewed, rescinded, or rewritten over a 24 month period.  We will significantly reduce the 
number of Air Force publications and ensure the remaining ones are concise, current, and 
relevant.  We have already rescinded over 100 Air Force Instructions.  While this review reduces 
stifling bureaucracy and associated cost, the more important impact is on our ability to fight.  
This supports the culture of centralized intent and decentralized execution we need for 
   
Page 14
   
 
 
Air Force Posture 
 
competent and entrusted Airmen to make decisions in future highly contested environments, 
where we cannot expect continuous centralized control. 
AIR FORCE WARFIGHTING INTEGRATION CAPABILITY (AFWIC):  The Air Force is implementing 
changes to program development that will better integrate the budget across the force and 
allow for more rapid change to meet emerging threats.  This will improve force design analysis 
to support national defense priorities and improve our ability to engage in multi-domain 
operations.   
REVITALIZING SQUADRONS:  Squadrons are the warfighting core of our Air Force.  We organize, 
train, and equip to deploy from the squadron up.  By revitalizing our squadrons, we are 
reinforcing cohesive, ready, and agile fighting forces to defend our Nation's interests in the 
complex security environment.  We depend on exceptional leaders to lead the world’s most 
powerful Air Force and joint teams.  We will develop future leaders, address cultural shifts to 
embrace 21st century talent management, and unlock the true potential of our Airmen.

May 17, 2018   
Good morning, Chairman Blunt, Ranking Member Murray, and distinguished Members 
of the Subcommittee.  I am Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., and I have served as the Director of 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2009.  It is an honor to appear before you today. 
Before I discuss NIH’s diverse investments in biomedical research and some of the 
exciting scientific opportunities on the horizon, I want to thank this Subcommittee for your 
sustained commitment to NIH to ensure that our nation remains the global leader in biomedical 
research and advances in human health. 
I want to personally express gratitude to this Subcommittee and its leadership for its 
support in crafting and passing the FY 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Bill.  The FY 2018 
Omnibus provides an incredible increase of $3 billion for NIH, including funding for opioid- and 
pain-related research, Alzheimer’s disease, antimicrobial resistance, and development of a 
universal influenza vaccine.  NIH has immediately set to work to invest those additional 
resources into groundbreaking research. 
As the nation’s premier biomedical research agency, NIH’s mission is to seek 
fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and to apply that 
knowledge to enhance human health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.  As some of 
you have witnessed first-hand on your visits to NIH, our leadership and employees carry out our 
mission with passion and commitment.  This extends equally to the hundreds of thousands of 
individuals whose research and training we support, located in every State of this great country, 
and where 81 percent of our budget is distributed. 
The FY 2019 Budget provides $34.8 billion for NIH to fund the highest priority 
scientific discoveries while also maintaining fiscal stewardship of Federal resources.  This 
Budget will consolidate research functions across the Department, optimize available 
1 
 
grant dollars to fund research, invest in NIH’s buildings and facilities, and support NIH 
priority areas including combatting the opioid epidemic, advancing Precision Medicine, 
and investing in translational research. 
The FY 2019 Budget consolidates HHS research programs into three new institutes 
within the NIH.  The Budget provides $380 million for the activities of the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), consolidated into the National Institute for 
Research on Safety and Quality.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH), including the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Program 
(EEOCIPA), currently administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
and the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research 
(NIDILRR), currently administered by the Administration for Community Living, are also 
proposed for consolidation into the NIH. 
America’s continuing leadership in conducting biomedical research requires 
infrastructure and facilities that are safe, compliant with all laws and regulations, and 
conducive to cutting edge research and research support.  NIH owns 281 facilities, including 
a research hospital, laboratories, and offices.  NIH’s Backlog of Maintenance and Repair 
exceeds $1.8 billion.  NIH is currently working with the National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering and Medicine to identify NIH facilities and infrastructure most in need of 
repair.  We look forward to providing that report to the Committee as soon as it is final. 
  The FY 2019 Budget makes much needed investments in NIH’s facilities.  The 
Budget proposes $200 million to support multiple biomedical research infrastructure 
priorities.  The FY 2019 Budget will allow NIH to continue to repair and upgrade 
deteriorated infrastructure.  In a recent analysis requested by this Committee, the condition 
2 
 
of NIH laboratories ranks near the lowest in the federal government due to the high 
likelihood of floods, power outages, and mechanical failures.  Items on the backlog list 
include: install steam and chilled water distribution systems; conduct structural repairs to 
older buildings; upgrade plumbing systems; repair elevators; upgrade heating, ventilating, 
and air conditioning systems; replace deteriorated electrical systems, and more.  In addition, 
due to the age and use of NIH facilities, NIH must invest funds in removing contaminants 
and hazardous waste before construction or capital repairs can begin in most of its buildings.  
The Budget will allow NIH to track what contaminants are being cleared from each of our 
buildings, which will ultimately help NIH do a better job of anticipating the cost and time 
required to begin new projects in existing buildings.  
Truly exciting, world class science is taking place.  I would like to provide just a few 
examples of the depth and breadth of the amazing research the FY 2019 Budget supports 
across the Institutes and Centers of NIH. 
Over the past 15 years, communities across our Nation have been devastated by 
increasing prescription and illicit opioid misuse, addiction, and overdose.  This Committee 
made a historic investment of $500 million in our work in FY 2018, and the FY 2019 Budget 
builds on that with an investment of $850 million to support a range of activities to advance 
research on pain and addiction.  NIH has and will continue to support cutting-edge research 
on pain, opioid misuse, addiction, and overdose.  Drug addiction is a complex neurological 
condition, driven by many biological, environmental, social, and developmental factors.  
Continued research will be key to understanding the crisis and informing future efforts.  Pain 
is an equally complex condition affecting millions of Americans.  NIH will: explore new 
formulations for overdose reversal medications capable of combatting powerful synthetic 
3 
 
opioids; search for new options for treating addiction and maintaining sobriety; continue to 
research how best to treat babies born in withdrawal through our ACT NOW trial; develop 
biomarkers to objectively measure pain; build a clinical trial network for pain research; and 
attempt to find non-addictive and non-pharmacological approaches to chronic pain.  Thanks 
to your support, all hands are on deck at NIH for this public health crisis. 
Another exciting area of continued investment in FY 2019, building on this 
Committee’s long-standing support, is Precision Medicine.  On May 6th, NIH officially 
launched the national roll-out of the All of Us Research Program.  This program will partner 
with one million or more people across the United States to provide the most diverse 
biomedical data resource of its kind and gain unprecedented insights into the biological, 
environmental and behavioral influences of disease.  The FY 2019 Budget, including 
resources from the 21st Century Cures Act, supports the ramp up of the program. After pilot 
testing system and forming partnerships with community organizations across the country, 
national enrollment is about to begin.  All of Us will not focus on only one specific 
disease.  Rather, it will be a national data resource to inform many research studies on a 
wide variety of health conditions. The data provided by one million participants will provide 
opportunities for researchers—including academics and citizen scientists—who want to 
understand how and why different people experience certain diseases and conditions while 
others do not, and why many people respond differently to treatments and prevention 
methods that will help accelerate medical breakthroughs.

NIH is the largest funder of basic biomedical research in the United States, providing a 
critical research foundation for both the public and private sector.  Building on that solid 
foundation of basic research, NIH also supports translational research that turns observations in 
the laboratory, clinic, and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals 
and the public, whether those interventions be diagnostics, therapeutics, medical procedures, or 
behavioral changes.  For example, Congress created the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) at 
the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) to advance the development 
of high-need cures and to reduce significant barriers between research discovery and clinical 
trials.  For example, CAN currently supports NCATS’ Tissue Chip for Drug Screening program, 
which was designed to revolutionize the process for predicting drug safety.  Researchers 
developing miniaturized platforms that could support miniature models of living organs — such 
as the lung, liver, and heart — that could be integrated into connected organ systems.  New 
Tissue Chip initiatives were funded in FY 2017 and this support will continue into FY 2019.  
CAN uses flexible research awards using the special authorization called other transaction 
authority to attract non-traditional government partners, and to expand, modify, and, if needed, 
discontinue activities to meet program needs.  The FY 2019 Budget will allow NCATS, through 
CAN, to continue to invest in high-risk, high reward initiatives designed to address significant 
scientific and technical challenges that hinder translational research.   
One of my personal priorities is developing the next generation of talented biomedical 
researchers.  Last year, I shared with the Committee NIH’s plans to build on our support for 
early-stage investigators through a new initiative known as the Next Generation Researchers 
Initiative.  The FY 2019 Budget includes a dedicated fund of $100 million in the Office of the 
5 
 
Director to incentivize additional Institute and Center support for these researchers.  NIH remains 
committed to the development, support, and retention of our next generation of investigators.   
We have never witnessed a time of greater promise for advances  in medicine than 
right now.  Your support has been critical, and will continue to be.  Thank you again for 
inviting NIH to testify today. We look forward to answering your questions.

STATEMENT OF  
CHAIRMAN AJIT PAI  
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION  
 
HEARING ON THE FISCAL YEAR 2019 FUNDING REQUEST AND BUDGET 
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS AND THE FEDERAL 
TRADE COMMISSION 
 
BEFORE THE  
SUBCOMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT  
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS  
U.S. SENATE 
 
MAY 17, 2018 
 
Chairman Lankford, Ranking Member Coons, and members of the Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government (FSGG), thank you for inviting 
me here to present the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 
Budget Request.  The Commission’s submission provides a spending level of $333,118,000, 
derived from regulatory fees for regular FCC operations, and an auction spending cap of 
$112,734,000.  At this stage, however, we note the need for an upward adjustment to the auction 
spending cap to enable the Commission to meet the FY 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act 
(Omnibus) requirement to establish new programs related to the post-incentive auction transition.   
The Commission’s fiscally responsible request will provide the resources necessary to 
advance the FCC’s critical strategic goals: (1) closing the digital divide; (2) promoting 
innovation; (3) protecting consumers and public safety; and (4) reforming the FCC’s processes.   
In particular, the FCC will continue to focus on expanding high-speed broadband access 
throughout the United States and bringing what I call “digital opportunity” to every American.  
We will continue to remove regulatory obstacles that unnecessarily slow down broadband 
deployment and make it more expensive.  And we will continue to modernize our Universal 
Service Fund (USF) programs so that we get the most broadband bang for the buck.  With 
respect to USF, we are moving forward this July with the nearly $2 billion Connect America 
Fund Phase II reverse auction to expand fixed broadband service to unserved regions, and are 
targeting 2019 for the $4.5 billion Mobility Fund Phase II reverse auction that will deliver 4G 
LTE access to many more Americans. 
As you are aware, the Commission received an appropriation of $322,035,000 in the 
Omnibus.  This number represented a reduction of approximately 5% from our FY 2017 
appropriation, minus the directed funding for our headquarters relocation.  To put our budget in 
perspective, in real, inflation-adjusted terms, the FCC’s appropriation has declined by over 17% 
since FY 2009.  
These reductions have required the Commission to operate more efficiently.  Since I 
became Chairman in January 2017, we have done just that, initiating management improvements 
to cut costs and accomplishing more with less money.  For example, we have saved a significant 
amount of money by closing a warehouse where we processed our mail, and instead contracting 
with a vendor that performs this task for many government agencies.  We also are reducing our 
workforce in FY 2018 to comply with OMB Memo 17-22, the Comprehensive Plan for 
Reforming the Federal Government and Reducing the Federal Civilian Workforce.  We value our 
workforce and recognize the importance of employee morale to the Commission’s operations, so 
we are combining regular attrition with voluntary personnel actions to achieve these levels.  By 
the end of FY 2018, we project that the Commission’s full-time equivalent (FTE) count will have 
declined over 10% in two years.  In light of this, our FY 2019 budget request proposes to freeze 
our FTE count rather than reduce it again—because further reductions in staffing would 
compromise the Commission’s ability to accomplish its mission. 
The need to stabilize our FTE count is especially important given the many additional 
responsibilities Congress assigned the FCC in the FY 2018 Omnibus.  The FCC-related sections 
of the Omnibus and accompanying Explanatory Statement require the Commission to revise its 
application and regulatory fee schedules, amend its Caller ID spoofing rules, complete a 
proceeding on 911 call location accuracy, use the Connect2Health tool to create a map that 
overlays opioid drug abuse with the degree of broadband access in an area, and coordinate with 
NTIA in its use of $7.5 million in infrastructure funds for broadband mapping.  We also have a 
broad range of reporting requirements on several Commission objectives, including rural call 
completion, veterans’ broadband access, broadband coverage in Indian Country, modernizing the 
high-cost Universal Service Fund program, and information technology (IT) modernization 
efforts.  And under the MOBILE NOW section of the Omnibus, we are required to move forward 
with freeing up additional low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum for 5G services, along with new 
spectrum for unlicensed use.  Timely meeting these obligations requires us to maintain and 
enhance the human resources we currently have. 
As part of our efforts to improve the Commission’s workforce, we are following through 
with establishing an Honors Engineering Program this year to recruit recent engineering 
graduates.  As the technologies that we regulate become more complex, it is important for us to 
bolster the ranks of engineers at the Commission.  Sophisticated technical analysis is at least as 
important as the legal analysis that supports our decisions.  In the past, we have not replenished 
our engineering resources.  Now, we will, with a program that will stand alongside our Honors 
Attorney Program. 
Additionally, a thorough review of our staffing and organization led us to determine that 
we must strengthen the role of economics and data analysis at the Commission so that our 
decisions are driven by evidence and produce benefits that outweigh their costs.  Accordingly, 
the Commission is in the process of creating the Office of Economics and Analytics to 
coordinate the contributions of economists and data professionals throughout the FCC.  Right 
now, attorneys have a seat at the policymaking table through the Office of General Counsel and 
engineers have a seat through the Office of Engineering and Technology.  The Office of 
Economics and Analytics will give economists their rightful seat, too. 
To maximize the benefits of improved organization and recruitment, we need to provide 
our workforce with the information technology tools necessary to effectuate our mission.  The 
Omnibus Explanatory Statement’s IT reporting requirement and the reauthorization language 
elevating the FCC’s Chief Information Officer’s status highlight Congress’ desire to ensure that 
the FCC has the resources necessary to modernize its IT systems and applications.  I recognize 
that this issue has been of interest to this Subcommittee and that Senator Moran has been at the 
2 
 
forefront of legislative efforts to ensure that agencies devote enough resources to IT 
modernization efforts.   
We likewise consider our IT upgrades to be an essential operations improvement.  Many 
of our systems and applications are quite old, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep 
them operational.  But by moving away from outdated legacy systems and applications toward 
cloud-based solutions, we will save money, improve resiliency, reduce cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities, and enhance the services we provide to those we regulate and the American 
people.  The Commission’s budget request of $8,535,200 for one-time IT investments—a request 
which was developed in close coordination with the Commission’s Acting Chief Information 
Officer—shows our commitment to your directives while at the same time representing a modest 
investment that should pay dividends in the long run.   
The IT investments also are the main reason why we are requesting a slight bump up in 
appropriations for our regular operations in FY 2019, from $322,035,000 to $333,118,000.  
Importantly, this FY 2019 spending level is identical to the amount authorized in Division P of 
the FY 2018 Omnibus. 
Our auctions program, which has been so successful in driving economic growth while 
directing billions of dollars into the Treasury, is projected in the FY 2019 request to increase 
spending slightly to $112,734,000 from the FY 2018 level of $111,150,000.  The current fiscal 
year saw a 5% drop from the FY 2017 high of $117 million.  The upcoming fiscal year will be a 
busy one on the auctions front.  For example, we intend to hold at least two high-band spectrum 
auctions—one for the 28 GHz band and another for the 24 GHz band.  Conducting these auctions 
successfully and promptly will be critical to American leadership in 5G, the next generation of 
wireless technology.  At a minimum, in FY 2019 we also will be engaged in preparations to 
auction additional high-band spectrum as well as mid-band spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band. 
With the auction funds we are requesting, we will also continue the critical work of 
facilitating the post-Incentive Auction repack.  The Financial Services and General Government 
section of the Omnibus provided up to one billion dollars in funding to complete the repacking 
process, in increments of $600,000,000 and $400,000,000 in FY 2018 and FY 2019, 
respectively.  Thank you for this critical funding.  First and foremost, the funds will be used by 
the Commission’s Incentive Auction Task Force to reimburse the relocation costs of full-power 
television stations.  Second, the appropriated funds will be used to provide funding for low-
power television stations, TV translators, and FM radio stations that incur costs resulting from 
the repack, as well as money for consumer outreach related to the repack.   
Just last month, the funds you appropriated allowed the Commission to increase the 
allocations available to full-power television broadcasters so that they have access to up to 
92.5% of their estimated costs.  This further allocation permits broadcasters to execute their post-
auction construction, prevents undue financial burdens, and minimizes the likelihood that we will 
need to claw back funds moving forward.  Importantly, noncommercial stations associated with 
state college systems that faced problems with local anti-deficiency statutes should now be able 
to maintain their licenses and have the funds on hand to finance the repack. 
The FY 2018 Omnibus provisions related to the incentive auction repack will add 
significantly to our workload during FY 2019.  We are now tasked with developing a rulemaking 
and overseeing the distribution of funds for three new programs, at least two of which—
LPTV/translator repacking costs and repack-associated FM radio station costs—will involve 
3 
 
significant data analysis, new information technology assets, and staffing.  We have evaluated 
the costs and recognize that the auction cap will need to be adjusted upward, but I believe that 
Congress has given us a clear directive to follow through with these programs.  Given the 
complexity of developing the prior analysis for the full-power stations and the sheer number of 
stations likely to seek funding under these new programs, we know that this effort will be 
resource-intensive.  We look forward to working with your staff to provide them with all 
essential information related to these costs. 
Finally, it is important to note that despite our planning and hard work in developing a 
budget, sometimes unforeseen problems and disasters can render the best budget difficult to 
manage.  For example, when hurricanes wreaked havoc last year on the people of Puerto Rico, 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, Texas, and Florida, we deployed staff to the field and I personally 
travelled to Puerto Rico twice.  We also took a wide variety of actions to assist with recovery and 
restoration efforts, from accelerating telecommunications carriers’ universal service funding to 
approving experimental licenses for broadband access, and we continue to work toward the 
complete restoration of communications services.   
We are using every tool in our toolbox to help people on the ground and get 
communications networks up and running as soon as possible.  Last week, the Commission 
approved my proposal to provide additional funding through a Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund 
(Bringing Puerto Rico Together Fund) and a Connect USVI Fund.  Each fund will provide 
additional short-term assistance for restoring communications networks in the aftermath of 
Hurricanes Irma and Maria and longer-term support for expanding broadband access throughout 
the islands.   
Although our agency did not receive disaster funds, our staff devoted all available 
resources to help deal with these catastrophes.  That dedication reflects how I see our agency: 
nimble, focused, and imbued with a can-do attitude when it comes to new challenges within our 
mandate.  It might be dealing with hurricane recovery on one day, illegal robocalls the next, and 
a false missile alert in Hawaii the day after that.  We do not have an easy mission, and sometimes 
we will disagree on the methods for seeing it through.  But I’m proud of the staff at the 
Commission for its commitment to serving the American people and promoting the public 
interest.

Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the FCC’s budget proposal.  I will be pleased to 
answer any questions that you may have.

Written Statement of Ronald L. Batory, Administrator 
Federal Railroad Administration 
U.S. Department of Transportation 
 
Before the Senate Committee on Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies 
May 16, 2018 
 
 
Chairman Collins, Ranking Member Reed, and Members of the Subcommittee:  
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today to discuss rail safety.  I come to my position as 
Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) with 45 years of experience in the 
railroad industry, rising to become the President and Chief Operating Officer of a significant 
freight rail carrier in the United States.  Throughout my career, I have been focused on continually 
improving safety performance, and I bring this same perspective to my current position with FRA. 
The mission of FRA is to enable the safe, reliable, and efficient movement of people and goods 
for a strong America, now and in the future.  Under the leadership of Secretary Elaine L. Chao, 
the FRA is executing this mission by: enforcing safety regulations; promoting non-regulatory 
safety improvement initiatives; managing Federal investments in rail infrastructure and service; 
facilitating regional rail planning; and nurturing research and development efforts to advance 
innovative technologies and best practices.  As we approach critical deadlines for railroads’ 
implementation of positive train control (PTC) systems, FRA remains committed to working with 
the railroads to ensure implementation of this important rail-safety technology in a timely manner. 
 
Positive Train Control Implementation 
Railroads’ implementation of PTC systems is at the top of our agenda.  PTC systems represent the 
most fundamental change in rail safety technology since the introduction of Automatic Train 
Control in the 1920s.  PTC is a processor-based and communication-based train control system 
designed to prevent certain train accidents.  Specifically, a fully implemented PTC system should 
prevent train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, the movement of trains through a switch 
left in the wrong position, and incursions into established work zones.  PTC accomplishes this by 
automatically controlling train speeds and movements if an operator fails to take appropriate 
action.

As mandated by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (RSIA), each Class I railroad and entity 
providing regularly scheduled, intercity or commuter rail passenger service must implement a PTC 
system on certain main lines over which 5 million or more gross tons of annual traffic are 
transported.  Specifically, railroads must implement PTC on main lines over which poison or toxic-
by-inhalation hazardous materials (PIH/TIH) are transported, and main lines over which intercity 
or commuter rail service is regularly provided.  Under RSIA, railroads were originally required to 
complete implementation by December 31, 2015.  Approximately two months before that deadline, 
the House and Senate overwhelmingly passed, and the President signed, the Positive Train Control 
Enforcement and Implementation Act of 2015 (PTCEI Act), extending the deadline for full PTC 
system implementation to at least December 31, 2018.  
 
In the PTCEI Act, Congress permits a railroad to request FRA’s approval of an “alternative 
schedule” with a deadline extending beyond December 31, 2018, but no later than December 31, 
2020, for PTC system implementation.  The law requires FRA to approve a railroad’s alternative 
schedule with a deadline no later than December 31, 2020, if a railroad submits a written request 
to FRA that demonstrates it has met the statutory criteria to qualify for such an alternative schedule.  
Currently, 41 railroads are required by statute to implement PTC systems: all 7 Class I freight 
railroads;  30  commuter  and  intercity  passenger  railroads,  including  the  National  Railroad 
Passenger Corporation (Amtrak); and 4 short line and terminal railroads.  The technology is being 
implemented on approximately 60,000 miles of the 140,000-mile railroad network.  
 
While railroads are making progress, most will need to request an alternative schedule.  Under the 
direction of Secretary Chao, FRA is taking a proactive approach to help railroads acquire, install, 
test, and fully implement certified PTC systems as soon as possible.  On December 27, 2017, one 
year ahead of the deadline, Secretary Chao sent letters to all railroads subject to the statutory 
mandate to implement PTC systems, stressing the urgency of safely implementing PTC systems 
and meeting the statutory deadline.  At the direction of Secretary Chao, FRA senior leadership met 
individually with executives from each of the 41 railroads in January and February of this year.  
Railroads have generally been candid in detailing the challenges and obstacles confronting their 
properties.    During  the  meetings,  we  sought  to  objectively  evaluate  each  railroad’s  PTC 
 
2 
 
 
deployment status, and learn what remaining steps each railroad needs to take to meet the deadline 
or satisfy the statutory criteria necessary to qualify for an alternative schedule.   
During these meetings, the railroads commonly conveyed the following ongoing challenges: 
•  There is a limited number of PTC system vendors and suppliers, all of which are 
significantly resource-constrained and serving all 41 railroads and their tenant railroads; 
•  As reliability and stability of PTC systems is still immature, railroads are experiencing 
significant technical issues with both PTC system hardware and PTC system software 
that often take considerable time to diagnose and resolve, impacting current operations; 
•  Host railroads noted that many tenant railroads that operate on main lines requiring PTC 
system implementation have made variable, and often unknown, progress equipping 
locomotives with operational PTC technology, while some tenant railroads report that 
their host railroads are not providing opportunity for testing;  
•  Railroads have only recently begun testing PTC systems for interoperability;  
•  Many commuter railroads stated that negotiating legal agreements with certain vendors 
and suppliers often took time to complete, given various insurance, liability, and State 
law issues; and 
•  Railroads noted concern about FRA’s approval review and approval cycle, given the 
surge in submissions requiring FRA approval in 2018-2019.   
 
Last month, FRA sent letters to fifteen railroads that we consider to be at risk of both missing the 
statutory  implementation  deadline,  and  failing  to  qualify  for  an  alternative  schedule.  This 
assessment was based on railroads’ self-reported progress as of December 31, 2017 (Quarterly 
PTC Progress Reports for Quarter 4 of 2017).  Based on the information provided, these railroads 
had installed less than 80 percent of their PTC system hardware as of December 31, 2017.  
 
Railroads’ self-reported Quarterly PTC Progress Reports for Quarter 1 of 2018 were due to FRA 
on April 30, 2018.  During the week of May 7, 2018, FRA released a status update with 
infographics depicting railroads’ self-reported PTC implementation progress for the first quarter 
of 2018.  Based on railroads’ self-reported progress during the first quarter, FRA is in the process 
of determining which railroads FRA still considers at risk of failing to meet the statutory criteria 
necessary to qualify for an alternative schedule. Based on FRA’s preliminary review, FRA believes 
 
3 
 
 
that approximately twelve of the fifteen railroads that were at risk as of December 31, 2017, remain 
at risk, as of March 31, 2018 representing a 20% improvement.       
 
By law, it is the railroads’ responsibility to implement PTC systems, but FRA is facilitating 
railroad and supplier collaboration to hasten, and urge, implementation.  We have also met 
individually with PTC system component suppliers to learn more about their capacity to meet the 
high demand of railroads to achieve timely implementation.  As noted in our most recent status 
update, as of March 31, 2018, PTC systems are in operation on approximately 60 percent of the 
freight railroads’ route miles that are required to be governed by a PTC system.  Passenger 
railroads have made less progress, with PTC systems in operation on 25 percent of required route 
miles.  Fourteen railroads report they have completed installation of all hardware necessary for 
PTC system implementation and another thirteen report they have installed over 80 percent of the 
required hardware.  In addition, as of March 31, 2018, all but two railroads report having acquired 
sufficient radio spectrum for their PTC system needs.   
 
Grant Funding and Financial Assistance 
The safety improvements PTC technology is designed to provide come with significant costs, both 
in terms of immediate acquisition and increased operations and maintenance costs.  Industry 
estimates PTC acquisition will exceed $14 billion, and maintenance will cost 10 to 20 percent of 
annual capital costs.  Since 2008, FRA has awarded approximately $735 million in grant funding 
to support railroads’ implementation of PTC systems.  FRA also supported the Federal Transit 
Administration (FTA) with its evaluation and selection of approximately $197 million in grant 
fund awards to 17 commuter and intercity passenger railroads and state and local governments for 
installation of PTC systems, which were announced on May 31, 2017.  The sources of the 
approximately $932 million in FRA and FTA grant funding are:  
•  $475 million from FRA’s High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Grant Program;  
•  $197 million in Section 3028 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST 
Act) funding;  
•  $120 million in annual capital grant funding to Amtrak (as of March 2018);   
•  $86 million from FRA’s Railroad Safety Technology Grant Program;  
•  $52 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act grant funding to Amtrak; and  
 
4 
 
 
•  $2 million in Research and Development grants. 
Additionally, in May 2015, FRA issued a $967.1 million loan to Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority for Long Island Rail Road’s and Metro-North Railroad’s implementation of PTC 
systems.  And on December 8, 2017, the Build America Bureau closed on a $162 million 
Transportation and Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act loan and a $220 million Railroad 
Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing loan to be issued to the Massachusetts Bay 
Transportation Authority for PTC system implementation.  
 
Furthermore, the FAST Act authorized three new competitive rail development grant programs-
two capital grant programs and one operating grant program; the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure 
and Safety Improvements (CRISI), Federal-State Partnership for the State of Good Repair, and 
Restoration and Enhancement. For Fiscal Years 2017 and 2018, Congress appropriated an 
additional $961 million in funding with an emphasis on assisting PTC implementation.  
 
•  $661 million for CRISI for capital projects, regional and corridor planning, environmental 
analyses, research, workforce development, and training to improve the safety, efficiency, 
and reliability of passenger and freight rail systems; of which, $250 million is set aside for 
PTC implementation; 
•  $275 million for Federal-State Partnership for State of Good Repair for capital projects on 
public- or Amtrak-owned infrastructure, equipment, and facilities to replace existing assets 
in-kind or with assets that increase capacity or service, maintain service while existing 
assets are brought into a state of good repair, or bring existing assets into a state of good 
repair; and 
•  $25 million for Restoration and Enhancement Grants for operating assistance for up to 3 
years per route to initiate, restore, or enhance intercity passenger rail transportation.  
 
In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Congress specifically made commuter railroads 
eligible  applicants  for  the  $250  million  set-aside  in  the  CRISI  program  for  PTC  system 
implementation.  As such, commuter railroads will be able to join short line railroads and public 
agencies  seeking  CRISI  financial  assistance  to  implement  PTC  systems.    FRA  is  working 
expeditiously to make this important funding for the grant programs available to prospective 
 
5 
 
 
grantees, with a primary focus on helping railroads implement PTC systems. In sum, thanks to the 
funding provided by this committee, the Department has made available over $2.5 billion in grants 
and loans since 2008. This amounts to nearly 20% of industry estimates for PTC implementation 
costs. 
Enforcement of the PTC Implementation Mandate 
As we move closer to the end of 2018, there are important questions about FRA’s enforcement 
policy.  FRA is authorized to assess monetary civil penalties against any railroad that fails to 
implement a PTC system by the applicable statutory deadline (either December 31, 2018, or, if a 
railroad has an approved alternative schedule, the applicable date not later than December 31, 
2020).  FRA is developing an enforcement strategy consistent with governing statutes to address 
any instances of railroad non-compliance with the statutory deadlines.   
 
FRA’s civil penalty schedule recommends, as guidance, a $16,000 civil penalty for a failure to 
timely complete PTC implementation on a track segment where it is required.  For any violation 
of a Federal rail safety statute, regulation, or order, however, the statutory minimum civil penalty 
FRA may assess is $853, and the ordinary statutory maximum is $27,904.  FRA may assess a civil 
penalty for each day the non-compliance continues, but FRA may elect to take enforcement action 
on a one-time basis or each month, quarter, year, or other interval of time during which the non-
compliance continues.  FRA is currently considering all options, within the framework established 
by law, to determine what type of enforcement action will be most effective and appropriate under 
the circumstances.  Our goal must be to ensure any enforcement action compels a railroad to fully 
implement its PTC system as efficiently and safely as possible.  
 
Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Safety and Trespass Prevention 
The other frequently persistent safety challenge for FRA is collisions, injuries and fatalities at 
highway-rail grade crossings, and the prevalence of trespassing on railroad rights-of-way.  Nearly 
96 percent of all rail-related fatalities are attributable to these two types of events.  While 
significant progress has been made, in 2017, there were over 2,100 collisions between highway 
users and trains, resulting in 273 deaths and 813 injuries.  Another 560 persons were killed as a 
result of being hit by trains while trespassing on railroad property. 
 
 
6 
 
 
To further address this issue, in addition to traditional brand awareness campaigns such as 
Operation Life Saver (OLI), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and FRA have 
partnered together to enact a national public education campaign (Stop. Trains Can’t.), targeted 
towards rail grade crossing safety.  This high-visibility campaign is now in its third year, and 
underscores the importance of obeying railroad crossing signs and warning devices, as well as 
crossing train tracks only at designated locations.   
 
Conclusion 
Since  this  Administration  took  office,  railroads  have  made  progress  with  their  PTC 
implementation.  From Quarter 1 of 2017 to Quarter 1 of 2018, railroads increased the total amount 
of installed PTC system hardware from 77% to 93%.  Notably, intercity passenger and commuter 
railroads increased their total PTC system hardware by 20% from Quarter 1 of 2017 to Quarter 1 
of  2018,  with  freight  railroads  increasing  hardware  installation  by  16%  during  that  same 
period.  Hardware installation is an initial, yet critical, phase of implementing a PTC system.    
 
Additionally, from Quarter 1 of 2017 to Quarter 1 of 2018, railroads acquired 23% of the 
spectrum necessary for PTC system implementation, increasing to 93% acquired.  At the onset of 
this Administration, PTC systems were in operation on approximately 18% of the freight 
railroads’ route miles required to be governed by a PTC system, and this increased to 60% as of 
March 31, 2018.  Intercity passenger and commuter railroads also increased, albeit at a much 
slower rate with PTC systems in operation on approximately 24% of the required route miles as 
of March 31, 2017, and increasing to 25% of the required route miles as of March 31, 2018. 
 
This progress is a testament to Secretary Chao’s commitment to ensuring our nation’s railroads 
are safe.  Additionally, it is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the men and women 
serving at FRA.  Although first charged with the PTC mandate in October of 2008, the progress 
exhibited over the last few years shows that many railroads have prioritized PTC implementation 
and adhered to Secretary Chao’s safety admonition. 
 
Moving forward, FRA will continue to support and facilitate railroads’ implementation of PTC 
technology  by  utilizing  the  tools  afforded  by  Congress  and  providing  extensive  technical 
 
7 
 
 
assistance  and  guidance  to  railroads  and  suppliers.    We  remain  vigilant  in  harnessing  and 
leveraging all the personnel, financial, and other resources available to help expedite railroads’ 
implementation efforts.  FRA holds an unwavering commitment to the safe and effective operation 
of railroads across the country.  We appreciate the Subcommittee’s support for our critical 
programs, and we welcome your continued partnership to advance rail safety and service.  I look 
forward to your questions.

CHRISTOPHER WRAY 
DIRECTOR 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 
STATEMENT BEFORE THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE,  
SUBCOMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE  
AND RELATED AGENCIES 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 
 
MAY 16, 2018 
 
  
Good afternoon Chairman Moran, Ranking Member Shaheen, and members of the 
Subcommittee. 
 
Thank you for allowing me to appear before you today.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI) especially thanks this Committee for its support of the men and women of the FBI in the 
Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Appropriation.  As the Committee is aware, FBI personnel are the 
lifeforce of the organization – they work tirelessly to combat some of the most complex and 
serious national security threats and crime problems challenging the Nation’s intelligence and 
law enforcement communities.  The funding you provided is imperative in allowing the FBI to 
retain these precious assets – our personnel – as well as address these considerable threats. 
 
Today, I appear before you on behalf of these men and women who tackle these threats and 
challenges every day.  I am extremely proud of their service and commitment to the FBI’s 
mission and to ensuring the safety and security of communities throughout our Nation.  On their 
behalf, I would like to express my appreciation for the support you have given them in the past, 
ask for your continued support in the future, and pledge to be the best possible stewards of the 
resources you provide.   
 
I would like to begin by providing a brief overview of the FBI’s FY 2019 budget request, and 
then follow with a short discussion of key threats and challenges that we face, both as a Nation 
and as an organization.   
 
FY 2019 Budget Request Overview 
 
The FY 2019 budget request proposes a total of $8.92 billion in direct budget authority to carry 
out the FBI’s national security, criminal law enforcement, and criminal justice services missions. 
The request includes a total of $8.87 billion for Salaries and Expenses, which will support 34,694 
positions (12,927 Special Agents, 3,055 Intelligence Analysts, and 18,712 professional staff), 
and $51.9 million for Construction.   
 
As a result of this budget being formulated before the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, it was built 
utilizing the prior year enacted level as a starting point. Accordingly, this request sustains prior 
1 
 
year personnel and operational funding, but provides no discrete program enhancements.  The 
request also includes a cancellation of $148 million from Criminal Justice Information Services 
(CJIS) automation fund available surcharge balances. 
 
When compared against the FY 2018 Omnibus enacted level, the FY 2019 request level 
represents a total decrease of $476 million, including a $318 million reduction in the FBI’s 
Construction account funding for one-time projects, and a $158 million reduction to the Salaries 
and Expenses account.  
 
 
Key Threats and Challenges 
 
This Committee has provided critical resources for the FBI to become what it is today – a threat-
focused, intelligence-driven organization. Our Nation continues to face a multitude of serious 
and evolving threats ranging from homegrown violent extremists to hostile foreign intelligence 
services and operatives; from sophisticated cyber-based attacks to internet facilitated sexual 
exploitation of children; from violent gangs and criminal organizations to public corruption and 
corporate fraud.  Keeping pace with these threats is a significant challenge for the FBI.  As an 
organization, we must be able to stay current with constantly changing and new technologies that 
make our jobs both easier and harder.  Our adversaries – terrorists, foreign intelligence services, 
and criminals – take advantage of modern technology, including the Internet and social media, to 
facilitate illegal activities, recruit followers, encourage terrorist attacks and other illicit actions, 
and to disperse information on building improvised explosive devices and other means to attack 
the U.S.  The breadth of these threats and challenges are as complex as any time in our history.  
And the consequences of not responding to and countering threats and challenges have never 
been greater.  
 
The support of this Committee in helping the FBI to do its part in facing and thwarting these 
threats and challenges is greatly appreciated.  That support is allowing us to establish strong 
capabilities and capacities for assessing threats, sharing intelligence, leveraging key 
technologies, and – in some respects, most importantly – hiring some of the best to serve as 
Special Agents, Intelligence Analysts, and professional staff.  We have built and are 
continuously enhancing a workforce that possesses the skills and knowledge to deal with the 
complex threats and challenges we face today – and tomorrow.  We are building a leadership 
cadre that views change and transformation as a positive tool for keeping the FBI focused on the 
key threats facing our Nation.   
 
Today’s FBI is a national security and law enforcement organization that uses, collects, and 
shares intelligence in everything we do. Each FBI employee understands that to defeat the key 
threats facing our nation, we must constantly strive to be more efficient and more effective. Just 
as our adversaries continue to evolve, so, too, must the FBI. We live in a time of acute and 
persistent terrorist and criminal threats to our national security, our economy, and our 
communities. These diverse threats underscore the complexity and breadth of the FBI’s mission: 
to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States. 
2 
 
 
National Security 
 
Counterterrorism 
 
Preventing terrorist attacks remains the FBI’s top priority.  The terrorist threat against the United 
States remains persistent and acute.    
  
From a threat perspective, we are concerned with three areas in particular: (1) those who are 
inspired by terrorist propaganda and feel empowered to act out in support; (2) those who are 
enabled to act after gaining inspiration from extremist propaganda and communicating with 
members of foreign terrorist organizations who provide guidance on operational planning or 
targets; and (3) those who are directed by members of foreign terrorist organizations to commit 
specific, directed acts in support of the group’s ideology or cause. Prospective terrorists can fall 
into any of the above categories or span the spectrum, but in the end the result is the same—
innocent men, women, and children killed and families, friends, and whole communities left to 
struggle in the aftermath. 
 
Currently, the FBI views the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and homegrown violent 
extremists as the main terrorism threats to the United States. ISIS is relentless and ruthless in its 
campaign of violence and has aggressively promoted its hateful message, attracting like-minded 
violent extremists. The threats posed by ISIS foreign terrorist fighters, including those recruited 
from the U.S., are extremely dynamic. These threats remain the highest priority and create the 
most serious challenges for the FBI, the U.S. intelligence community, and our foreign, federal, 
state, and local partners. We continue to identify individuals who seek to join the ranks of 
foreign fighters traveling in support of ISIS, as well as homegrown violent extremists who may 
aspire to attack the United States from within. In addition, in a manner consistent with the First 
Amendment, we are working to expose, refute, and combat terrorist propaganda and training 
available via the Internet and social media networks. Due to online recruitment and 
indoctrination, foreign terrorist organizations are no longer solely dependent on finding ways to 
get terrorist operatives into the United States to recruit and carry out acts. Terrorists in 
ungoverned spaces—both physical and cyber—readily disseminate propaganda and training 
materials to attract easily influenced individuals around the world to their cause. They encourage 
these individuals to travel, or they motivate them to act at home. This is a significant 
transformation from the terrorist threat our nation faced a decade ago. 
 
ISIS was able to construct a narrative that touched on many facets of life, from career 
opportunities to family life to a sense of community. Those messages were not tailored solely for 
those who are expressing signs of radicalization to violence—many who click through the 
Internet every day, receive social media push notifications, and participate in social networks 
have viewed ISIS propaganda. Ultimately, a lot of the individuals drawn to ISIS seek a sense of 
belonging. Echoing other terrorist groups, ISIS has advocated for lone offender attacks in 
Western countries. ISIS videos and propaganda have specifically advocated for attacks against 
3 
 
soldiers, law enforcement, and intelligence community personnel, but have branched out to 
include any civilian as a worthy target. 
 
The Internet is only one tool of many that terrorists use to recruit.  Many foreign terrorist 
organizations use various digital communication platforms to reach individuals they believe may 
be susceptible and sympathetic to violent extremist messages; however, no group has been as 
successful at drawing people into its perverse ideology as ISIS. ISIS has proven dangerously 
competent at employing such tools for its nefarious strategy. ISIS uses high-quality, traditional 
media platforms, as well as widespread social media campaigns to propagate its violent extremist 
ideology.  With the widespread use of social media, terrorists can spot, assess, recruit, and 
radicalize vulnerable persons of all ages in the United States either to travel or to conduct a 
homeland attack. Through the Internet, terrorists overseas now have access into our local 
communities to target and recruit our citizens and spread the message of radicalization to 
violence faster than we imagined just a few years ago. 
 
ISIS is not the only terrorist group of concern. Al Qaeda maintains its desire for large-scale 
attacks; however, continued counterterrorist pressure has degraded the group, and in the near 
term, al Qaeda is more likely to focus on supporting small-scale, readily achievable attacks 
against U.S. and allied interests in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region. Simultaneously, however, 
and especially over the last year, propaganda from al Qaeda leaders seeks to inspire individuals 
to conduct their own attacks in the United States and the West. 
 
In addition to foreign terrorist organizations, domestic violent extremist movements collectively 
pose a steady threat of violence and economic harm to the United States. Some trends within 
individual movements will shift as most drivers for domestic violent extremism, such as 
perceptions of government or law enforcement overreach, socio-political conditions, and 
reactions to legislative actions, remain constant. We are most concerned about lone offender 
attacks, primarily shootings, as they have served as the dominant mode for lethal domestic 
extremist violence. We anticipate that law enforcement, racial minorities, and the U.S. 
government will continue to be significant targets for many domestic violent extremist 
movements. 
 
As the threat to harm the United States and U.S. interests evolves, we must adapt and confront 
these challenges, relying heavily on the strength of our federal, state, local, and international 
partnerships. The FBI uses all lawful investigative techniques and methods to combat these 
terrorist threats to the United States. Along with our domestic and foreign partners, we are 
collecting and analyzing intelligence concerning the ongoing threat posed by foreign terrorist 
organizations and homegrown violent extremists. We continue to encourage information sharing, 
which is evidenced through our partnerships with many federal, state, local, and tribal agencies 
assigned to Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country. Be assured, the FBI continues to 
strive to work and share information more efficiently, and to pursue a variety of lawful methods 
to help stay ahead of these threats. 
 
4 
 
 
 
Counterintelligence 
 
The Nation faces a continuing threat, both traditional and asymmetric, from hostile foreign 
intelligence agencies.  Traditional espionage, often characterized by career foreign intelligence 
officers acting as diplomats or ordinary citizens, and asymmetric espionage, typically carried out 
by students, researchers, or businesspeople operating front companies, is prevalent.  Foreign 
intelligence services not only seek our Nation’s state and military secrets, but they also target 
commercial trade secrets, research and development, and intellectual property, as well as insider 
information from the Federal Government, U.S. corporations, and American universities. 
Foreign intelligence services continue to employ more creative and more sophisticated methods 
to steal innovative technology, critical research and development data, and intellectual property, 
in an effort to erode America’s economic leading edge.  These illicit activities pose a significant 
threat to national security and continue to be a priority and focus of the FBI. 
 
A particular focus of our counterintelligence efforts is aimed at the growing scope of the insider 
threat—that is, when trusted employees and contractors use their legitimate access to steal 
secrets for personal benefit or to benefit another company or country. This threat has been 
exacerbated in recent years as businesses have become more global and increasingly exposed to 
foreign intelligence organizations. 
 
To combat this threat, the FBI has undertaken several initiatives. We developed and deployed the 
Hybrid Threat Center (HTC) to support Department of Commerce Entity List investigations. The 
HTC is the first of its kind in the FBI; it has been well-received in the U.S. Intelligence 
Community and the private sector. 
 
Over the past year, we have strengthened collaboration, coordination, and interaction between 
our Counterintelligence and Cyber Divisions in an effort to more effectively identify, pursue, and 
defeat hostile intelligence services using cyber means to penetrate or disrupt U.S. government 
entities or economic interests. 
 
Finally, we have initiated a media campaign to increase awareness of the threat of economic 
espionage. As part of this initiative, we have made a threat awareness video available on our 
public website, which has been shown thousands of times to raise awareness and generate 
referrals from the private sector. 
 
 
Cyber Threats 
 
Virtually every national security threat and crime problem the FBI faces is cyber-based or 
facilitated.  We face sophisticated cyber threats from state-sponsored hackers, hackers for hire, 
organized cyber syndicates, and terrorists.  On a daily basis, cyber-based actors seek our state 
5 
 
secrets, our trade secrets, our technology, and our ideas—things of incredible value to all of us 
and of great importance to the conduct of our government business and our national security.  
They seek to strike our critical infrastructure and to harm our economy. 
 
 
As the committee is well aware, the frequency and impact of cyber-attacks on our Nation’s 
private sector and government networks have increased dramatically in the past decade and are 
expected to continue to grow.  We continue to see an increase in the scale and scope of reporting 
on malicious cyber activity that can be measured by the amount of corporate data stolen or 
deleted, personally identifiable information compromised, or remediation costs incurred by U.S. 
victims. Within the FBI, we are focused on the most dangerous malicious cyber activity: high-
level intrusions by state-sponsored hackers and global organized crime syndicates, as well as 
other technically sophisticated attacks.  FBI agents, analysts, and computer scientists are using 
technical capabilities and traditional investigative techniques—such as sources, court-authorized 
electronic surveillance, physical surveillance, and forensics—to fight the full range of cyber 
threats.  And we continue to actively coordinate with our private and public partners to pierce the 
veil of anonymity surrounding cyber based crimes. 
 
 
Botnets used by cyber criminals are have been responsible for billions of dollars in damages over 
the past several years. The widespread availability of malicious software (malware) that can 
create botnets allows individuals to leverage the combined bandwidth of thousands, if not 
millions, of compromised computers, servers, or network-ready devices to conduct attacks. 
Cyber threat actors have also increasingly conducted ransomware attacks against U.S. systems, 
encrypting data and rendering systems unusable— thereby victimizing individuals, businesses, 
and even public health providers. 
 
Cyber criminals often operate through online forums, selling illicit goods and services, including 
tools that can be used to facilitate cyber attacks. These criminals have also increased the 
sophistication of their schemes, which are more difficult to detect and more resilient. Cyber 
threats are also becoming increasingly difficult to investigate. For instance, many cyber actors 
are based abroad or obfuscate their identities by using foreign infrastructure, making 
coordination with international law enforcement partners essential. 
 
The FBI is engaged in myriad efforts to combat cyber threats, from improving threat 
identification and information sharing inside and outside of government to developing and 
retaining new talent, to examining the way we operate to disrupt and defeat these threats. We 
take all potential threats to public and private sector systems seriously and will continue to 
investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace. 
 
 
 
Going Dark 
6 
 
 
The rapid pace of advances in mobile and other communication technologies continue to present 
a significant challenge to conducting court-ordered electronic surveillance of criminals and 
terrorists.  There is a real and growing gap between law enforcement’s legal authority to access 
digital information and its technical ability to do so. The FBI refers to this growing challenge as 
“Going Dark,” and it affects the spectrum of our work.  
 
The benefits of our increasingly digital lives have been accompanied by new dangers, and we 
have seen how criminals and terrorists use advances in technology to their advantage. In the 
counterterrorism context, for instance, our agents and analysts are increasingly finding that 
communications and contacts between groups like ISIS and potential recruits occur in encrypted 
private messaging platforms. The use of encrypted platforms also presents serious challenges to 
law enforcement’s ability to identify, investigate, and disrupt threats that range from 
counterterrorism to child exploitation, gangs, drug traffickers and white-collar crimes. In 
addition, we are seeing more and more cases where we believe significant evidence resides on a 
phone, a tablet, or a laptop—evidence that may be the difference between an offender being 
convicted or acquitted. If we cannot access this evidence, it will have ongoing, significant effects 
on our ability to identify, stop, and prosecute these offenders.  
 
Where they can, our agents develop investigative workarounds on a case-by-case basis, including 
by using physical world techniques and examining non-content sources of digital information 
(such as metadata). As an organization, the FBI also invests in alternative methods of lawful 
engineered access. Ultimately, these efforts, while significant, have severe constraints. Non-
content information is often not sufficient to meet the rigorous constitutional burden to prove 
crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. Likewise, developing alternative technical methods is 
typically a time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process. Even when possible, such 
methods are difficult to scale across investigations, and may be perishable due to a short 
technical life cycle or as a consequence of disclosure through legal proceedings. 
 
We respect the right of Americans to engage in private communications, regardless of the 
medium or technology. The more we as a society rely on electronic devices to communicate and 
store information, the more likely it is that information once found in filing cabinets, letters, and 
photo albums will now be stored only in electronic form. Whether it is instant messages, texts, or 
old-fashioned letters, citizens have the right to communicate with one another in private, because 
the free flow of information is vital to a thriving democracy. Our aim is not to expand the 
government’s legal authority, but rather to ensure that we can obtain electronic information and 
evidence pursuant to the statutory authority that Congress already has provided to us to keep 
America safe. The benefits of our increasingly digital lives have been accompanied by new 
dangers, and we have seen how criminals and terrorists use advances in technology to their 
advantage. When changes in technology hinder law enforcement’s ability to exercise 
investigative tools and follow critical leads, those changes also hinder efforts to identify and stop 
criminals or terrorists. 
 
7 
 
Some observers have conceived of this challenge as a trade-off between privacy and security. In 
our view, the demanding requirements to obtain legal authority to access data—such as by 
applying to a neutral judge for a warrant or a wiretap—necessarily already account for both 
privacy and security. The FBI is actively engaged with relevant stakeholders, including 
companies providing technological services, to educate them on the effects of the Going Dark 
challenge on both public safety and the rule of law, and with the academic community and 
technologists to encourage their voluntary cooperation to work with us on developing technical 
solutions to this problem. 
 
 
Criminal Threats 
 
We face many criminal threats, from complex white-collar fraud in the financial, health care, and 
housing sectors to transnational and regional organized criminal enterprises to violent crime and 
public corruption. Criminal organizations—domestic and international—and individual criminal 
activity represent a significant threat to our security and safety in communities across the nation. 
A key tenet of protecting the Nation from those who wish to do us harm is the National Instant 
Criminal Background Check System, or NICS.  The goal of NICS is to ensure that guns don’t 
fall into the wrong hands, and also ensures the timely transfer of firearms to eligible gun 
buyers.  Mandated by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 and launched by the 
FBI on November 30, 1998, NICS is used by Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to instantly 
determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms.  NICS receives information 
from tens of thousands of FFLs and checks to ensure that applicants do not have a criminal 
record or aren't otherwise prohibited and therefore ineligible to purchase a firearm. In the first 
complete month of operation in 1998, a total of 892,840 firearm background checks were 
processed; in 2017, approximately 2.1 million checks were processed per month. 
 
While most checks are completed by electronic searches of the NICS database within minutes, a 
small number of checks require examiners to review records and resolve missing or 
incomplete information before an application can be approved or rejected.  Ensuring the timely 
processing of these inquiries is important to ensure law abiding citizens can exercise their right 
to purchase a firearm and to protect communities from prohibited and therefore ineligible 
individuals attempting to acquire a firearm. The FBI is currently processing a record number of 
checks, averaging over 2.3 million a month during the first three months of 2018.   
 
8 
 
Violent Crime 
 
Violent crimes and gang activities exact a high toll on individuals and communities. Many of 
today’s gangs are sophisticated and well organized and use violence to control neighborhoods, 
and boost their illegal money-making activities, which include robbery, drug and gun trafficking, 
fraud, extortion, and prostitution rings. These gangs do not limit their illegal activities to single 
jurisdictions or communities. The FBI is able to work across such lines, which is vital to the fight 
against violent crime in big cities and small towns across the nation. Every day, FBI special 
agents work in partnership with federal, state, local, and tribal officers and deputies on joint task 
forces and individual investigations. 
 
FBI joint task forces—Violent Crime Safe Streets, Violent Gang Safe Streets, and SafeTrails—
focus on identifying and targeting major groups operating as criminal enterprises. Much of the 
FBI criminal intelligence is derived from our state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners, 
who know their communities inside and out. Joint task forces benefit from FBI surveillance 
assets, and our sources track these gangs to identify emerging trends. Through these multi-
subject and multi-jurisdictional investigations, the FBI concentrates its efforts on high-level 
groups engaged in patterns of racketeering. This investigative model enables us to target senior 
gang leadership and to develop enterprise-based prosecutions. 
 
By way of example, the FBI has dedicated tremendous resources to combat the threat of violence 
posed by MS-13. The atypical nature of this gang has required a multi-pronged approach—we 
work through our task forces here in the U.S. while simultaneously gathering intelligence and 
aiding our international law enforcement partners. We do this through the FBI’s Transnational 
Anti-Gang Task Forces (TAGs). Established in El Salvador in 2007 through the FBI’s National 
Gang Task Force, Legal Attaché (Legat) San Salvador, and the United States Department of 
State, each TAG is a fully operational unit responsible for the investigation of MS-13 operating 
in the northern triangle of Central America and threatening the United States. This program 
combines the expertise, resources, and jurisdiction of participating agencies involved in 
investigating and countering transnational criminal gang activity in the United States and Central 
America. There are now TAGs in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Through these 
combined efforts, the FBI has achieved substantial success in countering the MS-13 threat across 
the United States and Central America. 
 
Despite these efforts, we still have work to do. The latest Uniform Crime Reporting statistics 
gathered from the Crime in the United States, 2016 show the number of violent crimes in the 
nation increased by 4.1 percent compared with the 2015 estimate, and although preliminary data 
for 2017 shows that violent crime overall is leveling off and murder may be on the decline, there 
are still jurisdictions that are struggling.  We also still have far to go before crime rates are back 
to the levels in 2014 and 2015.  We are committed to working with our federal, state, local, and 
tribal partners toward that end. 
 
9 
 
Transnational Organized Crime 
 
More than a decade ago, organized crime was characterized by hierarchical organizations, or 
families, that exerted influence over criminal activities in neighborhoods, cities, or states. But 
organized crime has changed dramatically. Today, international criminal enterprises run multi- 
national, multi-billion-dollar schemes from start to finish. Modern-day criminal enterprises are 
flat, fluid networks with global reach.  While still engaged in many of the “traditional” organized 
crime activities of loan-sharking, extortion, and murder, modern criminal enterprises are 
targeting stock market fraud and manipulation, cyber-facilitated bank fraud and embezzlement, 
identity theft, human trafficking , and other illegal activities.  Preventing and combating 
transnational organized crime demands a concentrated effort by the FBI and federal, state, local, 
tribal, and international partners.   
 
While the FBI continues to share intelligence about criminal groups with our partners and 
combines resources and expertise to gain a full understanding of each group, the threat of 
transnational crime remains a significant and growing threat to national and international security 
with implications for public safety, public health, democratic institutions and economic stability 
across the globe.   
 
Opioids 
 
Large amounts of high-quality, low cost heroin and illicit fentanyl are contributing to record 
numbers of overdose deaths and life-threatening addictions nationwide. Transnational criminal 
organizations (TCOs) are also introducing synthetic opioids to the U.S. market, including 
fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. To address this evolving threat, we are taking a multi-faceted 
approach and establishing many initiatives and units across our criminal program. 
 
One response to this threat is our Prescription Drug Initiative (PDI). The PDI was established in 
2016 in response to the substantial and increasing threat associated with prescription drug 
diversion, and in particular, the staggering national increase in opioid-related deaths. The 
objective of the PDI is to identify and target criminal enterprises and other groups engaged in 
prescription drug schemes; identify and prosecute, where appropriate, organizations with 
improper corporate policies related to prescription drugs; and identify and prosecute, where 
appropriate, organizations with improper prescribing and dispensing practices. The PDI 
prioritizes investigations which target “gatekeeper” positions, to include medical professionals 
and pharmacies that divert opioids outside the scope of their medical practice and/or distribute 
these medications with no legitimate medical purpose. Since its inception, the PDI has resulted in 
the conviction of numerous medical professionals and secured significant federal prison 
sentences, to include life terms for physicians who cause harm or death to the patients entrusted 
to their care. In August of 2017, PDI resources were enlisted to support the Attorney General’s 
Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit in 12 judicial districts significantly affected by the 
opioid crisis. 
 
10 
 
The Hi-Tech Organized Crime Unit (HTOCU) is another response to the growing opioid 
epidemic. This unit focuses on the trafficking of opioids via the Internet, specifically the Dark 
Net. HTOCU is leading a proactive effort to increase awareness, train personnel, and provide 
guidance to FBI field offices on how to successfully address this threat. As a result, numerous 
investigations and operations have been initiated and several online vendors who are facilitating 
the trafficking of opioids via the Internet, to include fentanyl, have been disrupted. 
Beyond these two programs, the FBI has dedicated additional resources to address this expansive 
threat. We have more than doubled our number of Transnational Organized Crime Task Forces, 
expanded the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Airport Initiative to 
focus on insider threats partnering with TCO actors, and created and led the Fentanyl Safety 
Working Group at FBI Headquarters, which has led to a new program to protect field agents and 
support employees with personal protective equipment (PPE) and opioid antagonists (i.e. 
naloxone) from the threat of fentanyl exposure. The FBI participated, along with other federal 
partners, in the creation of the Heroin Availability Reduction Plan (HARP), takes part in monthly 
HARP meetings hosted by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), and continues 
to provide training to our international law enforcement partners on successful identification, 
seizure, and neutralization of clandestine heroin/fentanyl laboratories. 
 
Crimes Against Children 
 
The FBI also has several programs in place to arrest child predators and to recover missing and 
endangered children. To this end, the FBI funds or participates in a variety of endeavors, 
including our Innocence Lost National Initiative, Innocent Images National Initiative, annual 
Operation Cross Country, Child Abduction Rapid Deployment Teams, Victim Services, 80 Child 
Exploitation Task Forces, 53 International Violent Crimes Against Children Task Force Officers, 
as well as numerous community outreach programs to educate parents and children about safety 
measures they can follow. 
 
 The FBI committed significant resources to Operation Pacifier, which targeted the 
administrators and users of “Playpen” – a members-only website on the Tor anonymity network 
run by a highly-sophisticated, global enterprise dedicated to the sexual exploitation of 
children.  To date, in the United States this operation has led to the arrest of over 348 individuals, 
the prosecution of 25 child pornography producers and 51 hands-on abusers, and the rescue or 
identification of 55 children.  This operation has also yielded the arrest of 548 individuals 
abroad, and the identification or rescue of 296 children abroad.  These successes only underscore 
how much work remains to address child exploitation on the Dark Net. 
 
Another such program is Operation Cross Country.  This nationwide law enforcement action 
focuses on underage victims of sex trafficking, completed its 11th iteration during the second 
week of October and recovered 84 minors. Over 400 agencies partnering with FBI field offices 
were instrumental in recovering child victims of all backgrounds and arresting sex traffickers, 
including sex customers. More than 100 victim specialists, in coordination with local law 
11 
 
enforcement victim advocates and non-governmental organizations, provided services to child 
and adult victims. 
 
Child Abduction Rapid Deployment Teams are ready response teams stationed across the 
country to quickly respond to abductions. Investigators bring to this issue the full array of 
forensic tools such as DNA analysis, trace evidence, impression evidence, and digital forensics. 
Through improved communications, law enforcement also has the ability to quickly share 
information with partners throughout the world, and these outreach programs play an integral 
role in prevention. 
 
 
Key Cross-Cutting Capabilities and Capacities 
 
I would like to briefly highlight some key cross-cutting capabilities and capacities that are 
critical to our efforts in each of the threat and crime problems described. 
 
Operational and Information Technology 
 
As criminal and terrorist threats become more diverse and dangerous, the role of technology 
becomes increasingly important to our efforts. We are using technology to improve the way we 
collect, analyze, and share information. We have seen significant improvement in capabilities 
and capacities over the past decade; but keeping pace with technology remains a key concern for 
the future. 
 
The FBI Laboratory is one of the largest and most comprehensive forensic laboratories in the 
world. Operating out of a state-of-the-art facility in Quantico, Virginia, laboratory personnel 
travel the world on assignment, using science and technology to protect the nation and support 
law enforcement, intelligence, military, and forensic science partners. The Lab’s many services 
include providing expert testimony, mapping crime scenes, and conducting forensic exams of 
physical and hazardous evidence. Lab personnel possess expertise in many areas of forensics 
supporting law enforcement and intelligence purposes, including explosives, trace evidence, 
documents, chemistry, cryptography, DNA, facial reconstruction, fingerprints, firearms, digital 
forensics and weapons of mass destruction (WMD). 
 
One example of the Lab’s key services and programs is the Combined DNA Index System 
(CODIS), software the FBI develops and administers, which allows 200 law enforcement 
laboratories throughout the United States to compare over 16 million DNA profiles. In the last 20 
years, CODIS has aided nearly 400,000 investigations, while maintaining its sterling reputation 
and the confidence of the American public. 
 
The Terrorist Explosives Device Analytical Center (TEDAC) is another example. Formally 
established in 2004, TEDAC serves as the single interagency organization that receives, fully 
analyzes, and exploits all priority terrorist improvised explosive devices (IEDs). TEDAC 
12 
 
coordinates the efforts of the entire government, including law enforcement, intelligence, and 
military entities, to gather and share intelligence about IEDs. These efforts help disarm and 
disrupt IEDs, link them to their makers, and prevent future attacks. For example, Laboratory 
Division personnel recently testified in New York in the successful prosecution of Muhanad 
Mahmoud Al Farekh after linking him to a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device prepared 
for an attack on the U.S. military base in Afghanistan. Although originally focused on devices 
from Iraq and Afghanistan, TEDAC now receives and analyzes devices from all over the world. 
 
Additionally, the Laboratory Division maintains a capability to provide forensic support for 
significant shooting investigations. The Laboratory Shooting Reconstruction Team provides 
support to FBI field offices by bringing together expertise from various Laboratory components 
to provide enhanced technical support to document complex shooting crime scenes. Services are 
scene- and situation-dependent and may include mapping of the shooting scene in two or three 
dimensions, scene documentation through photography, including aerial and oblique imagery, 
360-degree photography and videography, trajectory reconstruction, and the analysis of gunshot 
residue and shot patterns. Significant investigations supported by this team include the shootings 
at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California; the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, 
Florida; the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas, Nevada; and the shooting of 12 
police officers during a protest against police shootings in Dallas, Texas. 
 
FBI Special Agents and Intelligence Analysts need the best technological tools available to be 
responsive to the advanced and evolving threats that face our nation. Enterprise information 
technology must be designed so that it provides information to operational employees rather than 
forcing employees to conform to the tools available. IT equipment must be reliable and 
accessible, thus decreasing the time between information collection and dissemination. 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
In closing, the work being done by the FBI is immeasurable; however, we cannot afford to be 
complacent.  We must seek out new technologies and solutions for the problems that exist today 
as well as those that are on the horizon.  We must build toward the future so that we are prepared 
to deal with the threats we will face at home and abroad and understand how those threats may 
be connected. Towards that end, intelligence is gathered, consistent with our authorities, to help 
us understand and prioritize identified threats and to determine where there are gaps.  We then 
try to fill those gaps and continue to learn as much as we can about the threats we are addressing 
and those we may need to address.  We do this for national security and criminal threats, on both 
a national and local field office level.  We then compare the national and local perspectives to 
develop a threat prioritization ranking for each of the FBI’s 56 field offices.  By creating this 
ranking, we strive to actively pursue our highest threats where they are occurring.  This gives us 
a better assessment of what the dangers are, what’s being done about them, and what we should 
spend time and valuable resources on. 
13 
 
 
A key challenge inhibiting our ability to address current and future threats is the lack of a 
headquarters facility that fully fosters collaboration, intelligence sharing, and is dynamic, 
enabling Special Agents, Intelligence Analyst, and other Professional Staff to combat evolving 
threats as they arise. The current J. Edgar Hoover building is incompatible with what the United 
States expects of the FBI.  Our goal is to build a consolidated, secure, resilient intelligence 
community-worthy facility. But even more than that, what we need is a facility capable of 
meeting the increased demands of the Nation’s premier Intelligence and Law Enforcement 
organization for the future of the FBI. This building will address the way we will work for the 
next 50 or more years. 
 
Being expected to respond to a wide range of complex and ever-changing threats and crime 
problems is not new to the FBI.  Our success in meeting these challenges is, however, directly 
tied to the resources provided to the FBI.  The resources the Committee provides each year are 
critical for the FBI’s ability to address existing and emerging national security and criminal 
threats. 
 
Chairman Moran, Ranking Member Shaheen, and members of the Subcommittee, I would like to 
close by thanking you for this opportunity to discuss the FBI’s FY 2019 budget request and the 
key threats and challenges that we are facing, both as a nation and as an organization.  We are 
grateful for the leadership that you and this subcommittee have provided to the FBI. We would 
not possess the capabilities and capacities to deal with these threats and challenges today without 
your support.  Your willingness to invest in and support our workforce and our physical and 
technical infrastructure allow the men and women of the FBI to make a difference every day in 
communities large and small throughout our nation and around the world.  We thank you for that 
support. 
 
I look forward to answering any questions you may have.

“The Role of DHS in Stopping the Flow of Opioids & Other Dangerous Drugs”  
 
   
  
May 16, 2018 
Washington, D.C. 
 
 
Introduction  
Chairwoman Capito, Ranking Member Tester, and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, 
thank you for the opportunity to appear today to discuss the role of U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) in combating the flow of dangerous narcotics, including opioids, synthetic 
opioids such as fentanyl, and methamphetamine, into the United States. The opioid crisis is one of 
the most important, complex, and difficult challenges our Nation faces today, and was declared a 
National Emergency by President Donald Trump in October of last year.1 According to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioids – which include prescription opioids, 
heroin, and synthetic opioids – killed more than 42,000 people in the United States in 2016.2 The 
threats posed by methamphetamine have remained prevalent; the rate of drug overdose deaths 
involving methamphetamine more than doubled between 2010 and 2014.3 The CDC attributed 
7,663 overdose deaths in the United States to methamphetamine in 2016.4 
 
As America’s unified border agency, CBP plays a critical role in preventing illicit narcotics from 
reaching the American public while facilitating lawful travel and trade, protecting the United 
States from terrorist threats, and preventing the illegal entry of inadmissible persons and 
contraband. The President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget includes $16.7 billion in total 
discretionary and mandatory funding to help enable CBP to achieve our complex and vital mission 
with the right combination of talented and dedicated personnel, intelligence-driven and risk-based 
strategies, collaborative partnerships, tactical infrastructure, and advanced technology.  
 
The recently passed Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 supports CBP’s mission through 
investments in border infrastructure and technology, port security, and recruitment and retention 
efforts. We are eager to put this funding to work to improve our nation’s security. CBP’s multi-
layered, risk-based approach to interdict drugs at and in between our Ports of Entry (POEs)- 
including in the international mail and express consignment courier (ECC) environments- 
leverages targeting and intelligence-driven strategies that enhance the security of our borders and 
our country. This layered approach reduces our reliance on any single point or program and 
extends our zone of security outward, ensuring our physical border is not the first or last line of 
defense, but one of many. 
 
Narcotics Trends, Interdictions, and Challenges  
Along the more than 5,000 miles of border with Canada, over 1,900 miles of border with Mexico, 
and approximately 95,000 miles of shoreline, CBP is responsible for preventing the illegal entry 
of people and contraband at and between the POEs. Illicit drug interdictions in the border 
environment is both challenging and complex. Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs) and 
Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) continually adjust their operations to circumvent 
detection and interdiction by law enforcement, quickly taking advantage of technological and 
scientific advancements and improving fabrication and concealment techniques.

In FY 2018 to-date, the efforts of Office of Field Operations (OFO) and U.S. Border Patrol 
(USBP) personnel resulted in the seizure of more than 545,000 lbs. of narcotics including over 
38,000 lbs. of methamphetamine, over 35,000 lbs. of cocaine, and over 2,700 lbs. of heroin.5 CBP 
seizures of illicit fentanyl have significantly increased from approximately two lbs. seized in FY 
2013 to approximately 1,131 lbs. seized by OFO and USBP in FY 2017.6  
Approximately1,218lbs. of illicit fentanyl have already been seized in FY 2018.7 Fentanyl is the 
most frequently seized illicit synthetic opioid, but CBP has also encountered 18 fentanyl 
analogues.8 
 
DTOs seek to smuggle illicit narcotics, including methamphetamine and opioids, particularly 
heroin, across our land borders and into the United States at and between our POEs,9 and Mexican 
manufacturers and traffickers continue to be major suppliers of heroin and methamphetamine to 
the United States. The reach and influence of Mexican cartels, notably the Sinaloa, Gulf, and 
Jalisco New Generation Cartels, stretch across and beyond the Southwest border, operating 
through loose business ties with smaller organizations in communities across the United States.  
The threat of these cartels is dynamic; rival organizations are constantly vying for control, and as 
U.S. and Mexican anti-drug efforts disrupt criminal networks, new groups arise and form new 
alliances.  
 
At the Ports of Entry  
Smugglers use a wide variety of tactics and techniques to conceal drugs. CBP officers regularly 
find drugs concealed in body cavities, taped to bodies (body carriers), hidden inside vehicle seat 
cushions, gas tanks, dash boards, tires, packaged food, household and hygiene products, checked 
luggage, and construction materials on commercial trucks. For example, on March 24, 2018, CBP 
officers arrested an individual at Arizona’s San Luis POE after officers discovered more than 3.5 
lbs. of methamphetamine, worth nearly $11,000, wrapped around his torso. CBP officers seized 
the drugs and turned the arrested subject over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement – 
Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI).10 
 
Between October 1, 2010 and March 31, 2018, CBP conducted more than 84 million Non-
Intrusive Inspection (NII) examinations, resulting in more than 19,000 narcotics seizures and more 
than $79 million in currency seizures. On April 15, 2018, CBP officers at the Brownsville, TX 
POE used NII to inspect a personal vehicle, finding four packages of heroin with a total weight of 
12 lbs. and one package of methamphetamine weighing 1.3 lbs. The combined estimated street

8 These include: acetylfentanyl, butyrylfentanyl, β-hydroxythiofentanyl, α-methylacetylfentanyl, 
p_fluorobutyrylfentanyl, p-fluorofentanyl, pentanoylfentanyl (a.k.a. valerylfentanyl), 2-furanylfentanyl, p-
fluoroisobutyrylfentanyl, n-hexanoylfentanyl, carfentanil, benzodioxolefentanyl, acrylfentanyl, 2,2'-difluorofentanyl, 
methoxyacetylfentanyl, benzoylfentanyl, cyclopropylfentanyl, and hydrocinnamoylfentanyl. 
9 Heroin is also sometimes transported by couriers on commercial airlines. Heroin intercepted in the international 
commercial air travel environment is from South America, Southwest Asia, and Southeast Asia.

value of the narcotics from the seizure is approximately $348,000. CBP officers seized the 
narcotics along with the vehicle, arrested the driver and turned him over to the custody of ICE-
HSI for further investigation.11 
 
The FY 2018 Omnibus provided $224.6 million for NII systems and opioid detection equipment. 
The FY 2019 Budget request includes $44.2 million to build upon prior year investments and to 
recapitalize the current small scale and large-scale NII technology fleet. This funding will allow 
CBP to remain on track to ensure the NII fleet is operating within its service life by FY 2024, and 
will help CBP continue to use NII to safely, quickly, and effectively detect a wide range of 
contraband imported using a variety of conveyances, thereby facilitating lawful trade and travel.   
 
Constructing and improving CBP’s physical infrastructure also contributes to the safety of our 
Nation. CBP supports a vast and diverse real property portfolio, including more than 4,300 owned 
and leased buildings, over 28 million square feet of facility space and approximately 4,600 acres 
of land throughout the United States. The FY 2018 Omnibus provided $14.8 million to CBP for 
the critical furniture, fixtures, and equipment component of the General Services Administration’s 
(GSA) construction projects to modernize several land POEs. The FY 2019 President’s Budget 
includes an additional $14.8 million to enable modernization of land POEs along the northern and 
southern borders and to complete additional enhancement and expansion projects within the OFO 
portfolio. CBP is investing in modernizing our land POEs along the northern and southern borders 
to ensure that CBP’s physical infrastructure is operationally viable for frontline and mission 
support functions, including narcotics interdiction. Thanks to the funding provided in the FY 2018 
Omnibus, CBP is working with the GSA to ensure that our priority requirements at Columbus, 
San Ysidro and Calexico West ports of entry receive facilities enhancements and equipment 
essential to the unique mission of CBP. We look forward to working with GSA and Congress to 
ensure that our physical infrastructure meets CBP’s needs in FY 2019 and in the future.12  
 
International Mail and ECC Facilities   
While most illicit drug smuggling attempts occur at southwest land POEs, the smuggling of illicit 
narcotics in the international mail and ECC environment poses a significant threat. Illicit narcotics 
can be purchased from sellers through online transactions and then shipped via the United States 
Postal Service (USPS) or ECCs. DTOs and individual purchasers move drugs such as illicit 
fentanyl in small quantities, making detection and targeting a significant challenge. Follow-on 
investigations, which are conducted by ICE-HSI, are also challenging because these shippers are 
often not the hierarchically structured DTOs we encounter in other environments. 
 
To combat this threat CBP operates within nine major International Mail Facilities (IMF) 
inspecting international mail arriving from more than 180 countries, as well as 25 established ECC 
facilities located throughout the United States. CBP officers utilize experience, advanced 
targeting, and a variety of technologies including NII, chemical field testing equipment, wet 
chemical testing, and narcotics detection canines to target, detect, and presumptively identify 
illicit drugs at international mail and ECC facilities. For example, on November 23, 2017, CBP

officers in Memphis, TN, seized over six pounds of methamphetamine in an ECC shipment 
manifested as religious articles. ICE was notified and a controlled delivery was conducted that 
resulted in the apprehensions of two individuals. 
 
The majority of illicit fentanyl in the international mail and ECC environments is shipped in 
purities of over 90 percent, whereas the majority of fentanyl in the land border environment is 
seized in purities of less than 10 percent. It is important to note that the fentanyl seized on the 
Southern border in lower concentrations is often ready for sale to the end-user. The higher purity 
of fentanyl seized in the international mail and ECC environments is often intended to be mixed 
and repackaged by a distributor.13   
 
In FY 2017, CBP made 118 seizures of illicit fentanyl totaling approximately 240 lbs. in the ECC 
environment and 227 seizures totaling approximately 92 lbs. of illicit fentanyl in the international 
mail environment. CBP also made 65 seizures of fentanyl at land POEs totaling approximately 
853 lbs. In addition to illicit fentanyl, purchasers can access open source and dark web 
marketplaces for the tools needed to manufacture synthetic drugs. Fentanyl, powdered fentanyl, 
pill presses, and binding agents can all be purchased online and then shipped into the United 
States. In FY 2014, 24 seizures of pill presses and tablet machines were made by CBP officers. 
The number increased to 92 in FY 2017, and as of March 2018, CBP has seized 64 pill presses in 
FY 2018.  
 
CBP Resources and Capabilities to Detect, Target and Interdict Illicit Narcotics
 
CBP, with the support of Congress, has made significant investments and improvements in our 
 
drug detection and interdiction technology and targeting capabilities. The FY 2018 Omnibus 
provided an increase of $30.5 million in operations and support funding to improve opioid 
detection and laboratory services.  
 
The need to rapidly reduce the flow of opioids into the United States inspired an innovative 
approach to analyze and find potential solutions to the problem through both a CBP prize 
challenge done in conjunction with the DHS Science & Technology Directorate (S&T) and 
participating in the government-wide Illicit Drug Detection Integrated Project Team (IPT). This 
approach will touch on the broader need to analyze the full delivery chain, and this initial study 
will focus on operations at the IMFs to identify any non-materiel and/or materiel solution 
approaches to improve field capabilities within 12-18 months.  
 
CBP is also partnering with S&T to access emerging technologies and tools from start-ups and 
others. These resources, along with enhanced information sharing and partnerships, are critical 
components of CBP’s ability to identify and deter the entry of dangerous illicit drugs in all 
operational environments. CBP will continue to push for more efficient and effective ways to 
support our personnel and carry out our drug interdiction mission. 
 
                                                 
13 According to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), 2.2 lbs. (one kilogram) of pure fentanyl can make 
approximately 500,000 pills with a retail cost per pill between $10-$20. https://www.DEA.gov/druginfo/fentanyl-

Advance Information and Targeting 
At CBP’s National Targeting Center (NTC), advance data and access to law enforcement and 
intelligence records converge to facilitate the targeting of travelers and items of cargo that pose 
the highest risk to our security in all modes of inbound transportation. The NTC takes in large 
amounts of data and uses sophisticated targeting tools and subject matter expertise to analyze, 
assess, and segment risk at every stage in the cargo/shipment and travel life cycles. As the focal 
point of that strategy, the NTC leverages classified, law enforcement, commercial, and open-
source information in unique, proactive ways to identify high-risk travelers and shipments at the 
earliest possible point prior to arrival in the United States.   
 
The FY 2018 Omnibus provided a $58.2 million increase for intelligence and targeting capabilities 
and for expanded staffing at the NTC. The FY 2019 Budget proposes an increase of $26.9 million 
over the FY 2018 Budget request, or $41.7 million over the FY 2018 Omnibus. This increase will 
expand staffing through the hiring of 60 CBP officers 33 Intelligence Research Specialists, and 13 
support positions, as well as enhance NTC analytical modeling capabilities and provide for 
additional equipment. The NTC operates 24 hours a day with the mission of collaborating with 
federal, state, local, and international partners to effectively identify, target, screen, and interdict 
inbound and outbound passengers and cargo across all international modes of transportation that 
pose a threat to national security, public safety, agriculture, lawful trade, and safe travel. Effective 
targeting and interdiction prevents inadmissible high-risk passengers, cargo, and agriculture and 
bioterrorism threats from reaching U.S. POEs, extending our border security initiatives outward 
and making our borders not the first line of defense, but one of many.  
 
To bolster its targeting mission, the dedicated men and women of the NTC collaborate with 
critical partners on a daily basis including ICE-HSI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), members of the Intelligence Community, and the 
United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS). Investigative case data from our partners is fused 
with CBP targeting information to bolster investigations targeting illicit narcotics smuggling and 
trafficking organizations. Moreover, NTC works in close coordination with several pertinent task 
forces including the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, the High Intensity Drug 
Trafficking Areas, and the Joint Interagency Task Force-West, as well as the Department of 
Homeland Security’s (DHS) Joint Task Forces.  
 
Advanced Electronic Data 
CBP, with the support of Congress, has made significant investments in and improvements to our 
drug detection and interdiction technology and targeting capabilities in the international mail and 
ECC environments. CBP receives advance electronic data (AED) on over 40 percent of all 
international mail shipments with goods. An increasing number of foreign postal operators 
provide AED to USPS, which is then passed on to CBP to target high-risk shipments.  
 
CBP and USPS now have an operational AED targeting program at five of our main IMFs with 
plans for further expansion. USPS is responsible for locating the shipments and delivering them to 
CBP for examination. Thus far in FY 2018, CBP has interdicted 186 shipments of fentanyl at the 
John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) IMF, a participant in the AED pilot program. One 
hundred and twenty-five of those interdictions can be attributed to AED targeting.  
 
 
Page 5 of 9  
  
For example, on January 9, 2018, CBP officers assigned to the JFK IMF processed one seizure of 
benzoyl fentanyl that arrived in an e-packet mail parcel from China. The parcel was targeted in the 
Automated Targeting System (ATS) using AED. During the examination of the parcel, an 
unknown white powder was discovered. The parcel was referred for testing and was positively 
identified as benzoyl fentanyl. The benzoyl fentanyl was seized and, as a result, a joint law 
enforcement controlled delivery was conducted and a suspect was arrested and charged.  
 
CBP supports efforts to expand the ability of USPS to collect a customs fee to help offset the cost 
associated with facility upgrades, to develop new scanning technology, and to increase the 
availability of AED for international mail.  
 
Canines  
Canine operations are an invaluable component of CBP’s counternarcotic operations. The CBP 
Canine Training Program maintains the largest and most diverse law enforcement canine training 
program in the country. At our Nation’s POEs and at preclearance locations abroad, CBP officers 
utilize specially trained canines for the interdiction of narcotics, firearms, and undeclared 
currency, as well as in support of specialized programs aimed at combating terrorism and 
countering human trafficking. Concealed Human and Narcotic Detection Canines are trained to 
detect concealed humans and the odors of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, hashish, 
ecstasy, fentanyl and fentanyl analogs.   
 
The use of canines in the detection of narcotics is a team effort. CBP’s Laboratories and Scientific 
Services Directorate (LSSD) produces canine training aids and provides analytical support to the 
CBP Canine Training Program, including controlled substance purity determinations, pseudo 
training aid quality analyses, and research on delivery mechanisms that maximize safe vapor 
delivery during training exercises. Most recently, OFO’s National Canine Program, in 
coordination with LSSD, assessed the feasibility of safely and effectively adding fentanyl as a 
trained odor to deployed narcotic detection canine teams. On June 23, 2017, the Office of Training 
and Development’s CBP Canine Training Program successfully completed its first Fentanyl 
Detection Pilot Course.  This added the odor of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues to six OFO canine 
handler teams in the international mail and ECC environments. Beginning October 1, 2018, all 
new OFO canine handler teams graduating from the CBP Canine Training Program will have 
successfully completed a comprehensive CBP Canine Detection Team Certification to include the 
odor of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. Today, all OFO Concealed Human and Narcotic Detection 
canine teams across all of OFO’s operational environments have completed fentanyl training.   
 
During FY 2017, OFO canine teams were responsible for $26,813,863 in seized property, 
$1,905,925 in fines, $36,675,546 in seized currency, $29,674,839 in Financial Crimes 
Enforcement Network (FINCEN) actions, 197 firearms and 22,356 rounds of ammunition, 79 
concealed humans and 384,251 lbs. of narcotics. In FY 2018 to-date, OFO canine teams have been 
responsible for $7,322,522 seized property, $411,073 in fines, $7,951,376 in seized currency, 
$9,178,971 in FINCEN actions, 150 firearms, 5,418 rounds of ammunition, 105 concealed 
humans and 187,409 lbs. of narcotics.14

For example, on April 27, 2018 a CBP canine alerted officers to 70 lbs. of methamphetamine at 
Arizona’s San Luis POE within the quarter panels of a vehicle. Officers discovered more than 70 
lbs. of methamphetamine, worth almost $211,000, within the vehicle’s quarter panels. The vehicle 
and drugs were seized and the subject was arrested and turned over to ICE-HSI.15 
 
Workforce Protection 
CBP’s frontline operations, including drug interdiction activities, are extremely hands-on. The 
potential for contact with dangerous substances–including illicit synthetic opioids–is a very real 
health and safety risk to law enforcement personnel and canines. Fentanyl is approximately 50-100 
times more potent than morphine, and when in powder form at first glance, it is often mistaken for 
other drugs which appear as white powders, such as cocaine or heroin.   
 
Explicit instructions, including guidance to canine handlers, have been distributed to the field 
regarding the safe handling of fentanyl. In October 2015, CBP completed the first phase of a pilot 
program to train and equip CBP officers with naloxone, a drug for the treatment of opioid 
overdose. CBP officers at seven participating POEs16 received training on recognizing the signs 
and symptoms of opioid overdose, administering naloxone, and CPR. In February 2016, CBP 
expanded the pilot to an additional eight POEs, deploying 602 intranasal naloxone administration 
kits.17 To date, OFO has deployed over 1,100 two-dose boxes of naloxone to the field. Additional 
naloxone is being deployed to field offices upon request, as additional personnel are trained in its 
administration. The naloxone program has also expanded to LSSD and the USBP. CBP was the 
first Federal law enforcement agency to implement such a program. 
 
Growing CBP’s Workforce  
The people of CBP do the critical, sometimes dangerous work of keeping Americans safe. The FY 
2018 Omnibus provides $7.7 million to support the hiring of 328 new CBP officers, in addition to 
the 23 new officer positions requested in the FY 2018 Budget – a total increase of 351 CBP 
officers over the FY 2017 level. CBP officers are multi-disciplined and perform the full range of 
inspection, intelligence analysis, examination, and law enforcement activities relating to the 
arrival and departure of persons, conveyances, and merchandise at air, land, and sea POEs, 
including the interdiction of narcotics at POEs and in the international mail and ECC 
environments. 
 
CBP has faced challenges in the past to meet our hiring goals. However, we have taken decisive 
action, while recognizing that much work remains to be done to ensure we have enough officers 
and agents to meet our needs well into the future. In the last two years, more than 40 individual 
improvements to CBP’s hiring process have resulted in significant recruitment and hiring gains- 
despite record low unemployment around the United States and intense competition for highly-
qualified, mission-inspired people. With support from Congress, we are making investments in 
our capability and capacity to hire across all frontline positions. CBP is focusing on efforts to 
attract qualified candidates and expedite their progress through the CBP hiring process.

16 Phase 1 Naloxone Pilot Program POEs include El Paso, Laredo, Fort Lauderdale International Airport, John F. 
Kennedy International Airport, San Luis, San Ysidro, and Seattle/Blaine.  
17 Phase 2 Naloxone Pilot Program POEs include Miami Int’l/Miami Seaport, Boston, Buffalo, Detroit, Newark, 
Chicago, Houston Int’l/Houston Seaport, and Dallas.

CBP has embraced the use of social media, and is working to more effectively identify the best 
return on investment in digital media. CBP has introduced a mobile app for applicants in our 
hiring pipeline to keep them engaged during the process. CBP is also are going to introduce an 
“applicant care” component whereby a dedicated employee is assigned to an applicant to help 
them navigate the process. CBP is leveraging private sector expertise and experience in recruiting 
and human resources to provide additional capacity. 
 
CBP’s streamlined frontline hiring process has led to significant reductions in the average time-to-
hire. In the last 12 months close to 60 percent of new CBP officers on-boarded in 313 days or 
fewer, with more than 19 percent on-boarding within 192 days. While work remains to be done to 
improve the process, the current overall CBP officer average of 293 days to on-board is a 
significant improvement from the 469-day overall baseline established in January 2016. This 
streamlined process has helped us to grow our workforce by reducing the number of qualified 
candidates who drop out due to process fatigue or accepting more timely job offers elsewhere. 
CBP’s background investigation time is approximately 90 days for a Tier 5 level investigation, 
which is required for all of CBP’s law enforcement officer applicants and 90 percent of CBP 
applicants overall. This is considerably faster than the government average for the same level 
investigation. CBP is also recognized as having a best practice quality assurance program, which 
other agencies regularly visit CBP to learn about. 
 
In addition, to improve CBP officer staffing at certain locations, CBP utilizes group incentives 
such as recruitment incentives for several hard-to-fill locations, including Raymond, Montana; 
Jackman/Colburn, Maine; and many locations across Texas, Arizona, North Dakota, and southern 
California.  
 
As a result of these and other improvements, CBP’s FY 2017 hiring totals surpassed FY 2016 
totals, including increases of 21 percent for CBP officers. The total number of CBP officer 
applicants increased by 89 percent between FY 2015 and FY 2017, including a 45 percent 
increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017.  
 
Information Sharing and Operational Coordination 
Substantive and timely horizontal and vertical information sharing is critical to targeting and 
interdicting illicit drugs.  CBP works extensively with our Federal, state, local, tribal, and 
international partners and provides critical capabilities toward the whole-of-government approach 
to address drug trafficking and other transnational threats at POEs, in our IMFs and ECCs, and 
along the southwest border, northern border, and coastal approaches. Our targeting, detection and 
interdiction efforts are enhanced through special joint operations and task forces conducted under 
the auspices of multi-agency enforcement teams. These teams are composed of representatives 
from international and Federal law enforcement agencies who work together with state, local, and 
tribal agencies to target drug and transnational criminal activity, including investigations involving 
national security and organized crime.  
 
 
Page 8 of 9  
  
CBP hosts monthly briefings/teleconferences with Federal, state, and local partners regarding the 
current state of the border – the northern border and southwest border – to monitor emerging 
trends and threats and provide a cross-component, multi-agency venue for discussing trends and 
threats. The monthly briefings focus on drugs, weapons, and currency interdictions and alien 
apprehensions both at and between the POEs. These briefings/teleconferences currently include 
participants from: the Government of Canada, the Government of Mexico, DHS, ICE, U.S. Coast 
Guard (USCG), DEA, FBI, U.S. Northern Command; Joint Interagency Task Force-South, Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, Naval Investigative 
Command, State and Major Urban Area Fusion Centers, and other international, Federal, state, 
and local law enforcement as appropriate. 
 
Under DHS’ Unity of Effort initiative and with the establishment of three new DHS Joint Task 
Forces (JTF) CBP is enhancing our collaboration with other DHS components to leverage the 
unique resources, authorities, and capabilities of each agency to more effectively and efficiently 
execute our border security missions against DTOs and other threats and challenges. JTF 
operations also increase information sharing with Federal, state and local law enforcement 
agencies, improve border-wide criminal intelligence-led interdiction operations, and address 
transnational threats.   
 
Collaboration with our partners yields results. For example, the Chicago Field Office Tactical 
Analytical Unit initiated “Operation Mad Dog” in February 2017 to target international mail 
shipments suspected of containing illicit fentanyl and refer those shipments to our law 
enforcement partners across the country- including ICE-HSI and state, local, and tribal partners- 
for action. Targeted suspect shipments were intercepted and examined in IMFs based on 
information provided by our law enforcement partners and the NTC, as well as open-source 
information. Controlled deliveries have resulted in 37 arrests. Successes attributed to this 
Operation to-date also include the seizure of over 57 lbs. of fentanyl, firearms, cash and crypto-
currency, and the disruption of a major domestic dark web distributor of illicit fentanyl.   
 
CBP is a key partner in the implementation of the Office of National Drug Control Policy’s 
(ONDCP) Heroin Availability Reduction Plan (HARP). CBP also utilizes the Department of 
Justice’s Nationwide Deconfliction System operated by the DEA, conducting interagency 
deconfliction and coordination, and is working with the Heroin and Fentanyl Working Group at 
the DEA Special Operations Division, alongside ICE-HSI. 
 
Conclusion  
The FY 2019 President’s Budget recognizes the serious and evolving threats and dangers our 
Nation faces each day. With continued support from Congress, CBP, in coordination with our 
partners, will continue to refine and further enhance the effectiveness of our detection and 
interdiction capabilities to combat transnational threats and the entry of opioids, 
methamphetamine, and other illicit drugs into the United States.  
 
Chairwoman Capito, Ranking Member Tester, and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, 
thank you for the opportunity to testify today.  I look forward to your questions.

TESTIMONY OF 
E. SCOTT PRUITT 
 
ADMINISTRATOR 
U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 
 
BEFORE THE 
 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES 
U.S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
 
May 16, 2018 
 
Good  morning,  Chairman  Murkowski,  Ranking  Member  Udall,  and  members  of  the 
subcommittee.  I am joined by Holly Greaves, EPA’s Chief Financial Officer, and we are here today 
to  discuss  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency’s  (EPA)  proposed  FY  2019  budget,  which 
supports the goals and objectives in the FY 2018-FY 2022 EPA Strategic Plan.  
 
As the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, I am a firm believer in EPA’s 
mission to protect human health and the environment, and I am committed to helping provide 
future generations with a cleaner and healthier environment. We made great progress in year 
one. I laid out my vision for EPA’s continued progress in the Agency’s Strategic Plan. Under this 
Plan, our first goal is to “Deliver real results to provide Americans with clean air, land, and water, 
and ensure chemical safety.” This is the Agency’s Core Mission, and this budget enables progress 
on the most important priorities of this mission. The second goal of the Strategic Plan is to 
“Rebalance the power between Washington and the states to create tangible environmental 
results  for  the  American  people.”  Through  this  Cooperative  Federalism  approach,  we  will 
enhance shared accountability with our partners and increase transparency. The third goal of the 
Strategic Plan is to “Administer the law, as Congress intended, to refocus the Agency on its 
statutory obligations under the law.” By refocusing on the Rule of Law and Process, the Agency 
will enhance compliance with the law, create greater consistency and certainty for the regulated 
community,  prioritize  robust  science,  streamline  and  modernize  the  Agency,  and  improve 
efficiency and effectiveness. Through this vision of a more effective government that administers 
the law as Congress intends and cooperatively engages with our Nation’s states and tribes, EPA 
will continue to make real progress in achieving its mission. 
 
Over the past year as Administrator, I’ve witnessed firsthand the tremendous advances this 
Agency, and our partners, have made to address the Nation’s environmental challenges and fulfill 
our mission. The proposed budget continues this progress by supporting EPA’s highest priorities 
with federal funding for core work in air and water quality, contaminated land cleanups, ensuring 
the safety of chemicals in the marketplace, and compliance with the law. The President’s Budget 
aims to create a more efficient and effective EPA by reducing redundancies and improving 
operations.  
 
 
1 
 
As Administrator of EPA my top priorities include: infrastructure improvements to our Nation’s 
drinking water and wastewater systems; accelerating the remediation and revitalization of the 
most contaminated land in our communities; improving air quality through significant reductions 
in the number of areas not in attainment with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(NAAQS); and meeting all the statutory deadlines outlined in the amended Toxic Substances 
Control Act (TSCA). In my testimony, I will highlight how the budget directly supports these top 
priorities.  
 
I  firmly  believe  that  EPA  can  accomplish  far  more  when  the  Agency  focuses  on  working 
cooperatively with the states and tribes to improve public health and the environment. It is 
essential for the federal, state, territorial, and tribal governments to work together to provide 
the environmental protection that our laws demand and that the American people deserve.  This 
budget supports cooperative federalism through activities such as the Multipurpose Grant 
program, which is included in this budget. This program will support the implementation of 
statutory obligations delegated by EPA under pertinent environmental laws and provide states, 
tribes, and territories with increased flexibility to apply the funds toward their highest priorities.  
 
We will continue to work collaboratively with state, tribal, and local governments to provide 
flexibility to address important priorities. I personally look forward to working with you all, and 
other Members of Congress, to ensure we meet the environmental needs of your communities.  
 
In my testimony today, I will highlight how the budget advances the Strategic Plan’s three goals: 
Core Mission, Cooperative Federalism, and Rule of Law and Process. I will focus on key objectives 
to  improve  air  quality,  provide  for  clean  and  safe  water,  revitalize  land  and  prevent 
contamination, ensure the safety of chemicals in the marketplace, assure compliance with the 
law, and improve efficiency and effectiveness.  
 
Improving America’s Air Quality 
By funding air quality work at $410 million, EPA will continue to perform key activities in support 
of protecting human health and the environment through improving the quality of the Nation’s 
air with a focus on states and localities achieving greater levels of NAAQS attainment.  
 
States have made tremendous progress and significant investment in improving air quality.  Since 
1970, total emissions of the six criteria air pollutants regulated under the NAAQS program have 
dropped by 73 percent, while gross domestic product grew by over 252 percent. Despite this 
progress, much work remains to increase attainment levels across the country. We are focused 
on working in partnership with state, tribal, and local governments to design and implement air 
quality standards and programs. 
 
Areas designated as being in nonattainment of the standard face consequences, including 
increased regulatory burdens, restrictions on infrastructure investment, and increased costs to 
businesses. The Agency is looking to bring these areas into attainment by aggressively tackling 
the current backlog of State/Tribal Implementation Plans (SIP/TIP), more effectively mapping the 
SIP process, focusing on data integrity, and applying process improvements to EPA’s own review 
process.

We are also seeking additional authority from Congress to fee-fund the ENERGY STAR program 
by establishing user fees for entities that participate in the program. ENERGY STAR has proven to 
be an effective partner in helping consumers and businesses save money and reduce energy use. 
On the mobile source side, the Federal Vehicle and Fuels Standards and Certification program 
will focus its efforts on certification decisions. The Agency will conduct activities supporting pre-
certification confirmatory testing for emissions and fuel economy for passenger cars. 
 
Providing for Clean and Safe Water  
The President has emphasized that maintaining and improving infrastructure is critical to the 
foundation of this country’s economy and our global competitiveness. At EPA, this means, in large 
part, we will continue to make investments in drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, 
provide clear and actionable permitting decisions to the regulated community, and leverage 
federal investment with non-federal sources.  
 
The FY 2019 budget includes $2.3 billion to capitalize the State Revolving Funds (SRFs) to assist 
our implementing partners in revitalizing and rebuilding our Nation’s aging water resources. The 
budget funds the SRFs equivalent to the FY 2017 enacted level in recognition of the essential role 
they play in renewing and replacing infrastructure in communities all across the country. The FY 
2019 budget also includes $20 million for the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act 
(WIFIA) program to address water infrastructure needs. The $20 million provided for WIFIA could 
provide up to $2 billion in credit assistance, which, when combined with other funding resources, 
could spur up to an estimated $4 billion in total infrastructure investment.  In the first round of 
WIFIA funding, projects selected encompass the broad range of project types that the WIFIA 
program can finance, including wastewater, drinking water, stormwater, and water recycling 
projects. Taken together, these projects demonstrate how WIFIA complements the SRF programs 
as an additional innovative and flexible source of low-cost capital for communities of all sizes.  
 
EPA will continue to partner with states, drinking water utilities, and other stakeholders to 
identify and address current and potential sources of drinking water contamination, particularly 
in  areas  of  significant  regional  and  national  importance.  These  actions  are  integral  to 
infrastructure efforts because source water protection can reduce the need for additional 
drinking water treatment and avoid the associated costs. To assure the American people that 
their water is safe to drink, EPA's drinking water regulatory program monitors for a broad array 
of contaminants, evaluates whether contaminants are of public health concern, and regulates 
contaminants when there is a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction for persons 
served by public water systems.  
 
The Agency is focused on reducing lead exposure in the Nation’s water supply. EPA will work to 
advance progress in this area through revisions to the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) as well as 
regulations to implement the Water Infrastructure Improvement for the Nation (WIIN) Act and 
the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act. Lead exposure, particularly at higher doses, 
continues to pose a significant health and safety threat to our children, robbing them of the 
fullest potential of their health, intellect, and future. EPA and our federal partners are committed 
to taking action to address this threat and improve health outcomes for our Nation’s most 
vulnerable citizens – our children. This budget maintains funding for the Drinking Water State 
 
3 
 
Revolving Fund (DWSRF) which may be used to help communities replace lead service lines by 
providing principal forgiveness and low interest loans in addition to maximizing the use of the 
DWSRF  set-asides  to  fund  corrosion  control  studies  when  an  action  level  exceedance  is 
triggered. The maintained funding for the Drinking Water SRF, and the efforts of the President’s 
Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children, which I recently convened 
at EPA headquarters, will ensure we are focused on reducing lead exposure nationwide. 
 
EPA will continue to provide scientific water quality criteria information to our partners and the 
public, review and approve state water quality standards, and review and approve state lists of 
impaired waters. In FY 2019, the Agency will work with states and other partners on Total 
Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) as required by the Clean Water Act, as well as on other waterbody 
restoration plans for listed impaired waterbodies. The FY 2019 budget includes funding for the 
Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes geographic programs to support our state and local partners 
that monitor and protect these water bodies of national significance. EPA also will continue to 
implement  and  support  core  water  quality  programs  that  control  point-source  discharges 
through permitting and pre-treatment programs.  
 
Revitalizing Land and Preventing Contamination   
During my time as Administrator, I have heard from families, community members, elected 
officials, and  business  leaders that the  remediation  of  contaminated sites  takes too  long.  
Approximately 53 million, or 16 percent, of all Americans, live within three miles of a Superfund 
site.  Ensuring  that  the  Superfund  program  is  efficiently  and  effectively  managed,  and 
contaminated land is returned to a safe and productive use, is one of my top priorities. The FY 
2019 budget funds the Superfund account at the full FY 2017 enacted level to accelerate our 
progress in revitalizing land. Additionally, last year I established the Superfund Task Force, which 
identified  forty-two  recommendations  under  five  overarching  goals  for  revamping  EPA’s 
Superfund  work.  These  goals  are  Expediting  Cleanup  and  Remediation;  Re-Invigorating 
Responsible  Party  Cleanup  and  Reuse;  Encouraging  Private  Investment;  Promoting 
Redevelopment and Community Revitalization; and Engaging Partners and Stakeholders.  
 
Work to prioritize and reinvigorate the program is well underway and will continue into the 
future. One example of the changes we are implementing is the identification of Superfund sites 
for immediate and intense action. I personally monitor and engage with our Regional offices to 
accelerate work at these sites, such as at the West Lake site, where we recently released a 
Proposed Plan after years of inaction. At these sites and others across the country, the EPA is 
actively engaged with increasing the pace of remediation progress at Superfund sites on a 
continuous basis.      
 
In FY 2019, the Superfund program request is $1.089 billion, which will provide support to states, 
local  communities,  and  tribes  in  their  efforts  to  assess  and  cleanup  many  of  the  worst 
contaminated sites in the U.S. and return them to productive use. In addition to Superfund, over 
$109 million is requested for Brownfields programs that will cleanup and restore contaminated 
land  so  it  can  be  available  for  redevelopment  and  provide  economic  productivity.  EPA’s 
Brownfields programs are a successful model where the Agency works cooperatively with states, 
tribes, local governments, and other agencies to help communities oversee, plan, assess, and 
 
4 
 
clean up Brownfield properties. These activities not only return land to productive use but also 
help spur economic development and job creation. Brownfields grants have a community-driven 
approach, with over 69,200 acres of idle land made ready for productive use and over 129,240 
jobs and $24.7 billion leveraged to date.  
 
When it comes to cleaning up contaminated sites, I believe that the steps we have put in place 
will accelerate the pace of cleanups across the country.   
 
Ensuring the Safety of Chemicals in Commerce 
Ensuring the safety of chemicals used in commerce and sold in the marketplace is a top priority.  
Resources are needed to support efforts to minimize Americans’ exposure to pesticides, help 
maintain a healthy food supply, and address public health concerns. 
 
In FY 2019, $59 million is requested for the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Chemical Risk 
Review  and  Reduction  Program  to  support  the  Agency’s  significant  ongoing  and  new 
responsibilities for ensuring that new and existing chemicals in commerce do not present 
unreasonable risks to human health or the environment. The Act authorized a new TSCA Service 
Fee to help provide funding for EPA to carry out its new responsibilities. The Agency recently 
released a proposed TSCA User Fee rule and anticipates collecting fees in FY 2019. The new fee 
will help defray cost of carrying out new sections of the law and better support pre-manufacture 
notice reviews.  
 
In FY 2019, the Agency expects to review over one thousand new chemical submissions, take 
appropriate testing and risk management actions - including orders and Significant New Use 
Rules (SNURS) where appropriate, and make affirmative determinations. New chemicals will be 
evaluated and decisions will be based on the best available science and the weight of evidence.    
 
Under my leadership, we have eliminated a backlog of more than 300 new chemical submissions 
that required re-review under the new law; completed reviews under the new law of more than 
1,150 new chemical notifications; and commenced risk evaluations for an initial set of 10 priority 
chemicals  and  are  issuing  scoping  documents  on  schedule.  The  Agency  is  also  increasing 
transparency for the public and regulated community about these chemicals.  
 
We are working with companies to gather all the relevant information early in the process to 
inform safety reviews for new chemicals. Reviewing new chemicals quickly will enable those 
deemed safe to enter the marketplace to support jobs and our economy. The reduction in the 
backlog is the result of prioritizing and implementing process efficiencies. EPA will continue to 
work with all stakeholders to identify additional changes to improve the quality, efficiency, and 
transparency of the new chemical review program.  
 
For chemicals in commerce, EPA will maintain an ambitious schedule for initiating and completing 
chemical risk evaluations and, where risks are identified, for initiating and completing regulatory 
actions  to  address  those  risks.  EPA  also  will  implement  the  new  mandates  related  to 
determinations on claims for confidentiality for chemical identities. 
 
 
5 
 
Chemical and biological pesticides help meet national and global demands for food. They provide 
effective pest control for homes, schools, gardens, highways, utility lines, hospitals, and drinking 
water treatment facilities, while also controlling vectors of disease. Identifying, assessing, and 
reducing the risks presented by the pesticides on which our society and economy rely is integral 
to ensuring environmental and human safety. EPA’s pesticide licensing program evaluates new 
pesticides before they reach the market and ensures that pesticides already in commerce are 
safe when used in accordance with the label as directed by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, 
and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), and the Food 
Quality Protection Act (FQPA). The program ensures that the pesticides available in the U.S. are 
safe when used as directed. EPA will continue to review and register new pesticides, new uses 
for  existing  pesticides,  and  other  registration  requests  in  accordance  with  all  statutory 
requirements. In addition, the program is increasing the focus on pollinator health and working 
with other federal partners, states, and private stakeholder groups to stem pollinator declines 
and increase pollinator habitat. 
 
In FY 2019, EPA will invest resources to improve the compliance of pesticide registrations with 
the Endangered Species Act. A portion of the funding also will ensure that pesticides are correctly 
registered and applied in a manner that protects water quality. 
 
Assuring Compliance with the Law 
For decades, the protections mandated by federal environmental laws have been essential to the 
growth of American prosperity and improvements to public health and environmental quality. 
EPA  remains  focused  on  assisting  the  regulated  community  in  attaining  and  maintaining 
compliance with our Nation’s environmental laws and, where necessary, punishing bad actors 
who shirk those laws. This means providing effective compliance assistance to our industry 
partners and enforcing civil and criminal cases in areas that address substantial impacts to human 
health and the environment. EPA’s enforcement efforts to date have produced billions of dollars 
in cleanup commitments from violators and billions of pounds of pollution prevented and cleaned 
up as a result of those commitments.  
 
As an example of providing increased compliance assistance, the budget includes a proposal for 
new voluntary oil and chemical facility compliance assistance fees. For interested parties, EPA 
would conduct a walk-through and provide recommendations on ways the facility could come 
into or remain in compliance with EPA regulations. This is one example of how the Agency is 
advancing compliance assistance.     
 
As states are the primary implementers of many enforcement action programs, we will focus 
Agency resources on non-delegated programs. We will rely on our state partners to achieve 
compliance and enforcement goals, and we will focus resources on our direct implementation 
responsibilities and oversight, emphasizing violations with public health and environmental 
impacts.  
 
 
 
 
6 
 
Improving Efficiency and Effectiveness  
The budget includes EPA’s Reform Plan to implement the goals of the President’s Executive Order 
13781: Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch. The plan includes a series of 
projects focused on improving how EPA provides services and engages customers. Projects 
include streamlining EPA’s permit review processes, deploying a Lean Management System, and 
reducing unnecessary reporting burden on the regulated community. We will build on business 
process improvements by partnering with states, tribes, and local governments to expand and 
support approaches across all our programs. The Agency will work with states and use Lean 
techniques to streamline the review of state-issued permits.  
 
This budget does not include plans to close Regional offices, but we will continue to prioritize 
efforts that save taxpayer dollars through space consolidation and essential renovations to 
reduce and optimize our physical footprint. We will work with states and tribes to target 
resources to core statutory work and provide flexibility to address particular priorities and 
concerns. As careful stewards of taxpayer resources, we will examine our programs for those that 
are unnecessary, redundant, or that have served their purpose and accomplished their mission 
or  are  outside  EPA’s  statutory  mandates.  The  FY  2019  President’s  Budget  identifies  and 
eliminates programs to save taxpayers approximately $620 million relative to the FY 2018 
enacted budget.  
 
With this budget, we are committed to fulfilling our mission of protecting public health and the 
environment. With support from our state and local partners, and by working with each of you 
and your colleagues in Congress, we can make a real difference for communities across America.   
 
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.  I look forward to answering your 
questions.

Testimony of 
The Honorable Michael Stenger 
Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate 
Before the 
Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch 
Committee on Appropriations 
United States Senate 
 
May 15, 2018 
INTRODUCTION 
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Murphy, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for 
allowing me to testify today. I am pleased to report on the progress of the Office of the Senate 
Sergeant at Arms (SAA) and our plans to enhance our service to the Senate. 
For fiscal year 2019, the SAA requests a total budget of $210,752,000. This request represents a 
modest 1% increase from the fiscal year 2018 enacted budget. Since that time, we have realized 
significant cost savings from staff buyouts completed in 2013 and 2016 and from rigorous contract 
management and restructuring, while continuing to provide critical, high-quality services the 
Senate community has come to expect. Our customer satisfaction levels remain high and we 
remain good stewards of the funds entrusted to us.  
Leading the efforts of the SAA is an outstanding senior management team, including my Deputy 
Jim Morhard; Assistant SAAs Dick Attridge (Protective Services and Continuity), John Jewell 
(Chief Information Officer), Mike Chandler (Operations), and Krista Beal (Capitol Operations); 
General Counsel Terence Liley; and Chief Financial Officer Robin Gallant. The many goals and 
accomplishments set forth in this testimony would not have been possible without this team’s 
leadership and commitment, as well as the dedication of the women and men who work for the 
Senate SAA office. 
PROTECTIVE SERVICES AND CONTINUITY 
 
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS 
We designed our plans and procedures to safeguard the life safety of Senators, staff, and visitors 
by equipping them with the tools and training to respond to emergencies. Our primary objective is 
to ensure the Senate continues its essential functions following emergency events. 
During  2017,  the  Emergency  Preparedness  office  worked  with  Senate  offices  to  update 
106 Emergency Action Plans using guidelines from the Congressional Accountability Act. We 
supplied kits, annunciators, and escape hoods, as well as ensuring Member suites displayed 
evacuation maps with routes and  elevator locations for mobility-impaired individuals. New 
Member offices received personalized training on emergency preparedness procedures, personnel 
accountability, and equipment use. We distributed Emergency Preparedness Quick Reference 
Guides to familiarize Members and Office Emergency Coordinators with critical information 
about responding to threatening situations and emergency events, and to highlight key actions 
necessary during life safety events. We also assisted 26 Member offices and committees with 
1 
drafting Continuity of Operations (COOP) plans, strengthening the Senate’s ability to continue 
performing its essential functions during and after disruptive events. 
We conducted 280 classes, training over 3,800 staff on a variety of topics including responding to 
active shooters, protective actions, emergency action planning, and ALERTs/Remote Check-in 
procedures. The “Responding to an Active Shooter” class taught with the U.S. Capitol Police 
(USCP) provided participants with an understanding on how to react and what to expect from law 
enforcement. Moreover, we hosted more than 180 visitors at our annual Preparedness Fair, which 
provided information about resources available in the National Capital Region.  
The readiness and protection of Senators, staff, and visitors within the Senate Chamber continues 
to be a primary focus. We worked with USCP to conduct a full-scale exercise to validate the 
Chamber Emergency Action Guide. The exercise included more than 250 participants, many from 
Member offices. Participants responded to a variety of scenarios, including aircraft intrusion, rapid 
building evacuation, and active shooter simulation inside the Chamber, all resulting in staff taking 
rapid protective measures.  
We manage Alternate Chamber and Briefing Center planning efforts for the Senate, and constantly 
aim to improve offsite capabilities should relocation become necessary. We conducted a multi-
day, full-scale exercise of the Alternate Chamber at Ft. McNair to confirm the location’s viability. 
This exercise included participation from approximately 40 Member offices and committees. The 
Emergency Preparedness office also developed and implemented the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) 
COOP Program, allowing the Senate to use this space during a continuity event.  
In collaboration with USCP, we continue to conduct annual evacuation, shelter in place, and 
internal relocation drills to familiarize staff with effective life safety responses in emergencies. We 
supported more than 30 drills that included the Capitol, CVC, Senate office buildings, Senate Page 
School, Employee Child Care Center, and Postal Square. Many of these exercises were “no notice” 
to create a more realistic response to emergency events. In FY 2017, we conducted our first aircraft 
security threat evacuation drill for Senate office buildings, requiring staff to evacuate their 
buildings and move farther away from the Capitol than they normally would. We also conducted 
an internal relocation drill during a non-recess week to evaluate realistic staff levels that would 
relocate to these sites. Feedback from both exercises was overwhelmingly positive and we were 
able to make improvements to our plans based on lessons learned.  
We partnered with the USCP, House, and Architect of the Capitol (AOC) to acquire and roll out 
the Joint Emergency Mass Notification System (JEMNS), the first joint alert notification system 
on Capitol Hill. JEMNS adds desktop pop-up features and smartphone applications to convey 
critical life safety notifications to the Capitol Hill community. The final product eliminates the 
need for legacy notification systems, saving the Senate approximately $400,000 a year. In 2018, 
JEMNS will be expanded to include the Library of Congress (LOC). During FY 2019 we will lead 
the Joint Audible Warning System (JAWS) project to replace the outdated annunciator system in 
order to project audible life safety alerts throughout office spaces. JAWS will make it easier for 
USCP officers to communicate life safety messages in areas not supported by the Public Address 
System. Project expenses will be shared with the House, USCP, AOC, and LOC, allowing for 
potential volume discounts and reduced infrastructure costs. 
To ensure we can handle call volumes from friends and family of staff affected by a mass casualty 
event, we led an effort between the Senate, House, USCP, and AOC to award a joint contract for 
comprehensive Call Center services at a cost savings to all stakeholders.  
2 
Staff communications, when executing emergency plans, remains key in achieving successful 
outcomes, especially while deployed at continuity sites. We are finalizing plans to modernize an 
outdated radio system and permit multi-agency interactions  on encrypted equipment during 
exercises and real-world events. We are working with Executive Branch agencies to acquire 
secure,  interoperable  mobile  devices  that  provide  classified  communication  capabilities  for 
officers and emergency response staff. We are also collaborating with the House, USCP, AOC, 
and LOC to update and manage joint continuity communications plans and procedures. 
Finally, to improve the ability to prepare for and respond to life safety and COOP events, we are 
converting several vendor support staff to full-time employees, eliminating two major contracts 
valued at $900,000 and saving approximately $100,000 annually. This conversion will allow us to 
better retain talented staff and add capabilities and skillsets for unclassified continuity facilities 
and life safety emergency planning.   
CONTINGENCY PROGRAMS 
My team continues to develop and refine contingency plans in collaboration with the Joint 
Congressional Continuity  Board and with Executive Branch agencies to sustain a common 
approach to preparedness. We developed an inter-branch Memorandum of Agreement ensuring 
organizational interests are represented across the continuity arena. Further, the completion of a 
Joint Congressional Continuity Strategy document was a major milestone achieved last year, to 
ensure Congress can meet its Constitutional obligations and perform its essential functions under 
any circumstances. Another successful continuity initiative includes the completion of robust 
contingency site plans and expanded site capabilities stemming from collaboration between the 
Senate, House, and USCP. We are making significant progress on developing an austere capability 
that greatly improves the Senate’s readiness posture. 
We continue managing a comprehensive Senate exercise program to routinely practice and 
validate plans. Last year, we conducted 23 exercises covering all aspects of continuity, including 
Mobile Assets, Alternate Chamber, Chamber Protective Actions, Emergency Operations Center, 
Briefing  Center,  communications,  transportation,  continuity  staffing,  evacuations,  internal 
relocation, shelter in place, alert notifications, and continuity of government. Our planners provide 
an  objective,  independent  analysis  of  life  safety  and  continuity  programs  and  assist  in  the 
validation and improvement of actionable plans by identifying strengths, weaknesses, and lessons 
learned through no-fault environments. This approach ensures program objectives are met in a 
manner that continues to benefit Members and staff.  
SECURITY PLANNING AND POLICE OPERATIONS 
This  office  provides  security  and  law  enforcement  support  for  the  Senate  community  in 
Washington, D.C., and over 450 state offices. In FY 17, we coordinated 1,508 Senate campus 
access requests—an increase of eight percent. Further, we worked with the Committee on Rules 
and Administration and USCP to publish numerous door and barricade restrictions during recess 
periods, special events, and holidays. Additionally, we coordinated security coverage of 538 
committee  hearings,  a  40%  increase  over  the  previous  year,  and  conducted  four  Member 
residential security assessments.  
We also provide situational awareness through USCP Command Center support. During FY 2018 
we transitioned from a contract to full-time staff who are on duty while the Senate is in session 
and during periods of recess. Approximately 480 incidents and events, a 31% increase over the 
previous year, were monitored through this program last year. Security oversight and coverage 
3 
during the Inauguration, State of the Union address, summer concert series, and various joint 
sessions of Congress was also conducted. 
The State Office Readiness Program provides security systems and enhanced office security 
construction  designs—as  well  as  preparedness  equipment,  training,  and  services—to 
approximately 450 state offices without impacting Member office budgets. During 2017, the 
program provided physical security enhancements to 35 new Member state offices, as well as 
enhanced security in 21 existing offices. The program also trained nearly 300 Office Emergency 
Coordinators, staff, and interns through 24 online classes and webinars. We continue supporting 
state offices to comply with the Congressional Accountability Act in their emergency action and 
Continuity of Operations plans through coordinated development and storage of their master 
documents. In 2018, we will initiate a program to notify state offices of potential protest activity. 
INTELLIGENCE AND PROTECTIVE SERVICES 
We recognize the value of maintaining collaborative partnerships with various federal, state, and 
local law enforcement, intelligence, and force protection entities to synchronize information, 
identify security risks, monitor threat streams, and maintain situational awareness. This ensures 
appropriate mitigation and prevention strategies are deployed for protecting the safety and security 
of the Senate, domestically and abroad.  
Growing  social  media  platforms  and  the  availability  of  open  source  materials  has  allowed 
individuals to spread malicious intents and activities to a wide-ranging audience. Intelligence and 
Protective Services thus proactively monitors and analyzes platforms for potential threat activity 
as well as engages with community partners and subject matter experts to maintain security-related 
situational awareness in an effort to deter malicious acts against Members, their families, staff, and 
associated locations.   
Our office collaborates with USCP and other law enforcement to ensure appropriate outreach and 
coordination for specifically targeted Members and staff. Further, we monitor, evaluate, and 
conduct vulnerability, risk, and threat assessments to determine and apply suitable security 
measures and protective operations coverage. We conduct situational awareness outreach for the 
Senate community regarding significant upcoming events or planned activities around the Capitol 
complex and state offices to prevent adverse impacts to Senate business. Finally, we partner with 
USCP and other agencies to support contingency and oversee security operations planning to 
ensure incident management and response action plans are in place.  
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
CYBERSECURITY AND RESPONSE 
The SAA is in the third year of transforming the Cybersecurity Program from being reactive to 
becoming proactive. In 2016, gap analysis identified personnel and process shortfalls subsequently 
addressed in the 2018 budget request. We intend to capitalize on this throughout 2018 and 2019 
with the additional FTEs provided in the FY18 budget request. 
We  continue  to  focus  our  efforts  on  cyber  threats.    Last  year,  we  implemented  a  robust 
Cybersecurity Awareness Program providing real-time, actionable information to users. While 
technical solutions such as firewalls, anti-spyware, and anti-virus go a long way toward protecting 
information, end-users are still the first and most effective line of defense. 
4 
To help ensure Senate staff are best prepared for this important responsibility, we provide Cyber 
Awareness sessions to member offices, to include state offices, and committees.  For example, we 
sponsored the October Cybersecurity Awareness Month focusing on social media topics to instill 
security awareness when using these applications. Throughout 2018 and 2019, we will continue to 
increase training and resources to the Senate offices. 
We are undergoing a shift in focus toward cybersecurity risk in 2018 and will provide risk reports 
to assist offices in lowering their risk. In 2017, we provided 86 reports, identifying vulnerabilities 
requiring remediation, to Member offices. Throughout 2018 and 2019, we will refine and improve 
this reporting by conducting cybersecurity audits and identifying personnel requiring cybersecurity 
training. These audits will identify and measure vulnerabilities based on risk. Further, we will have 
audits performed on the Cybersecurity Department to determine how effectively the Cyber 
Security Operations Center can detect, react, and recover from cyber threats. This will provide 
leadership a more holistic review as to the resiliency of the entire Cybersecurity Program. 
CIO SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS 
We are working with offices on the multi-factor authentication effort to identify business needs 
for enhanced security. This past year, we worked with office representatives to understand their 
concerns and requirements. We then surveyed the marketplace for possible solutions. We are 
developing a procurement strategy to identify the best solutions for the Senate. 
 
In response to office requirements, the SAA conducted an analysis for a Credential Management 
Solution.  We  validated  the  requirements  with  Member  and  committee  offices  and  SAA 
stakeholders. We selected and implemented a solution to secure and manage passwords and other 
user authentication information based on the Senate’s business and technical requirements. The 
Credential Management service was made available to all offices in March 2018.  
In response to an ongoing need for increased security of privileged accounts, we expanded 
enrollment of SAA staff credentials with administrative access to highly valuable data into our 
Privileged Access Management solution (PAM). PAM significantly increases the security posture 
of  Senate  information  systems,  protecting  the  most  sensitive  data  by  limiting  exposure  of 
privileged credentials and protecting access to those credentials with two-factor authentication. 
We have fully enrolled user credentials for all administrators of our network authentication, 
messaging, enterprise mobility management, and Virtual Machine Infrastructure systems, as well 
as the administrators of numerous cybersecurity threat detection and management systems. We are 
expanding PAM services to offices for the protection of their most sensitive systems administration 
accounts, including the accounts used to administer their Constituent Services Systems.  
We  maintain  the  digital  identity  data  that  supports  IT-related  business  requirements  of  the 
Senate. In maintaining the authoritative source of digital identity data for the Senate community, 
we process over 8,000 identity requests and credential matching tasks annually. The mature 
Identity and Access Management (IAM) program under development will enhance data security 
by centralizing the on-boarding, identity maintenance, access, and de-provisioning of identities 
requiring access to applicable Senate systems. We are beginning the multi-year implementation of 
a software suite that will automate 90% of the aggregation tasks (identity requests and credential 
matching). Automating on-boarding, de-provisioning, and digital identity lifecycle tasks will 
greatly  improve  the  productivity  of  Senate  offices  by  reducing  the  administrative  burden 
associated with hiring, terminating, and transferring personnel. 
5 
The CIO supports the IT portion of our Continuity of Operations programs through a variety of 
IT-related functions. This support includes our Mobile Communication Vehicles, network and 
phone communications for Alternate Chamber Operations, Leadership Coordination Centers, 
Emergency Operations Centers, and Briefing Centers.  
ENTERPRISE AND NETWORK SERVICES 
We remain focused on increasing connectivity speed in both the state Senate offices and the Senate 
D.C. campus. We have completed the migration to broadband internet service for state offices, 
providing these offices significant increases in bandwidth at each of the 450-plus locations. The 
increased bandwidth also supports emerging technologies such as improved video conferencing 
capabilities. The Senate wireless network comprises over 1,180 wireless access points supporting, 
on average, 3,500 concurrent users per day in 12 campus buildings and multiple state offices. State 
office access point purchases have increased 30% over this last year. We have installed just under 
30 additional access points throughout the Senate Complex and increased the 5 GHz channel width 
to improve the user experience, adding additional redundancy and bandwidth. 
As a part of our five-year data center plan, we switched our primary and alternate data centers, 
making our Virginia data center primary and Capitol Hill data center the alternate to support 
continuing operations plans. We are in the process of researching feasibility of moving our 
alternate data center to a Legislative-owned building on Capitol Hill. For 2018 and 2019, the focus 
will shift to adding additional redundancy within the Senate data centers. We have begun by 
collapsing  existing  network  connections  into  single  pairs  of  switches  at  each  location  and 
aggregating all internal services. In addition, this will prepare the network for the future where 
various systems will be sharing hardware, allowing for more virtualization and elasticity. 
Moving over 800 Virtual Machines to the new primary data center positions the SAA to achieve 
improved uptime and greater system resiliency. We upgraded the Senate’s Virtual Machine 
Infrastructure (VMI), which hosts over 1,100 virtual servers and supports nearly every Senate 
application.  We  upgraded  the  software  supporting  the  VMI  infrastructure,  adding  new 
functionality, additional redundancy, enhanced disaster recovery capabilities and the ability to 
leverage  Multi-Factor  Authentication.  Additionally,  we  started  the  planning  and  assessment 
process to upgrade the storage platform supporting the VMI. The next storage solution will further 
improve performance, enabling the CIO to virtualize even the most demanding applications. With 
the  recent  improvements  to  the  Senate’s  VMI,  we  are  revisiting  consolidated,  virtualized 
Constituent Services Systems solutions to reduce the server footprint. 
In response to office requests, we expanded our enterprise storage services to include Media and 
Archive Storage (MAS), a cost-effective solution for archival of high-capacity data.  MAS 
provides scalable storage fora variety of file formats and can be increased or decreased based on 
current demand and usage. In contrast to traditional storage procurement, MAS enables us to 
quickly and more precisely address unknown capacity requirements that are subject to rapid 
change and pass lower cost to offices utilizing the service. 
ENTERPRISE AND SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT SERVICES 
We continue to work in partnership with the Secretary of the Senate to modernize the Financial 
Management  Information  System.  Several  new  financial  modules  are  scheduled  for 
implementation this year, allowing for the retirement of legacy system components. This multi-
year joint effort will continue until the financial system modernization is completed. We continue 
to support operations and enhancements to the PeopleSoft Senate Payroll System and Human 
6 
Resources Information System. We also developed a new feature for the Payroll Employee Self 
Service to allow employees the option to stop receiving paper pay advices, W2s, and Affordable 
Care Act forms in the mail. 
We continue to manage shared resources to host office websites on senate.gov. As part of the 
ongoing effort to modernize the underlying senate.gov platform, we identified a solution to enable 
better management of the shared resources while continuing to provide flexibility and autonomy. 
This year, we completed the installation of OpenShift Enterprise, enabling us to define website 
hosting environments for each office with dedicated resources. Beginning in the spring of this year, 
all new websites are being deployed on the modern platform. We will continue capitalizing on this 
to best support our customers. 
TranSAAct is our platform for doing business online and addressing the requirements of offices.  
Over  the  past  year,  we  have  continued  to  add  functionality  to  TranSAAct.  We  completed 
improvements to the communications services requests and updated the ID request forms to reflect 
new business processes and rules. We also added the ability to review and request remote access 
tokens, updated the software subscription renewal pages, updated billing presentment to be more 
meaningful to committees; added service recipient profiles to reduce redundant data entry and 
updated the underlying technologies to keep pace with technology improvements. This year, we 
are working with stakeholders to integrate changes related to the new technology catalog and to 
make appropriate changes to TranSAAct based on new business processes supporting a new 
Identity and Access Management system. 
 
Office  Application  Manager  (OAM)  is  a  secure  and  replicated  Web-based  application  that 
provides Member offices and support organizations the ability to create and manage customized 
online forms such as service academy nominations and internship and fellowship applications. It 
also includes tools to handle requests from constituents and communicate back to them via email. 
In  the  last  year,  we  worked  with  Senate  staff  to  enhance  the  questionnaire  customization 
functionality to allow offices the ability to create sub-questions so answers are more informative. 
This new feature will improve the offices’ ability to receive more targeted and accurate responses 
from applicants or requestors. To date, 67 offices and support organizations have OAM accounts, 
with 480 questionnaires created.   
 
IT SUPPORT COMMUNICATIONS 
The SAA is responsible for the digital signage located throughout the Hart, Dirksen, and Russell 
buildings, under the direction of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. The digital 
signage includes interactive directory services, hearing schedules, and future graphical wayfinding 
capabilities and location based emergency notifications. This multi-year project will expand the 
signage to approximately 58 locations throughout the Senate office buildings, located at entrances, 
stairwells, elevators, and other high-traffic areas. 
The much anticipated, multi-year effort to upgrade and modernize the state office telephony 
infrastructure for  all 450-plus state offices is underway  and the first 14 offices have been 
completed. It will provide each state office with new hardware, increased flexibility, a feature-rich 
voicemail platform, and additional security at a lower cost. The SAA onsite installation experience 
is increasing the SAA’s view and understanding of the Senate offices’ telephony needs, as well as 
building strong working relationships with the office staff.  
We are beginning our implementation of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk lines, which will 
remove our dependency on Verizon for trunking, generating cost savings over the next several 
7 
years. The upgrade of several servers integral to the D.C. telephone switch will allow us to improve 
support and be prepared for future technologies.  
While our D.C. voicemail platform has been upgraded to allow for additional features and 
redundancy, we are now working on expanding capacity due to increased voicemail traffic. This 
upgrade will spilt our voicemail platform into two separate clusters in order to dedicate additional 
resources  for  voicemail  traffic,  allowing  for  maximum  capacity  on  each  cluster  while  still 
maintaining the features, functionality, and flexibility required to support Senate offices. 
Our central IT Help Desk answers approximately 11,000 inquiries from Senate users annually, 
taking trouble reports, and coordinating the activities of technicians who resolve problems by 
phone, online, and in person. During the past year, the installation team completed more than 7,000 
installation projects, received a 99% score on timeliness, while the Help Desk resolved 48% of 
trouble tickets during the initial call.  
OPERATIONS 
CENTRAL OPERATIONS 
Transportation and Fleet Operations 
Transportation and Fleet Operations procures, manages, and maintains Senate vehicles; operates 
the Senate Daily Shuttle service; and provides the Senate with emergency transportation and 
logistics support. The fleet includes trucks, vans, buses, SUVs, electric vehicles, handicapped-
accessible vehicles, and Segways. During FY 2019, we will focus on reducing older vehicle 
inventory with newer, more efficient vehicles to better meet the needs of our customers. In 
FY 2017, staff transported more than 25,000 passengers through the SAA Shuttle service. 
Photography Studio 
The Photo Studio provides photography and photo imaging services for Senate offices and 
committees. The studio manages and maintains the Photo Browser application, which provides 
Senate offices a secure, accessible archive of all photos accumulated during a Senator’s term in 
office.  This  application  contains  more  than  1.5  million  photo  image  files.  In  2017,  staff 
photographed  more  than  100,000  images,  produced  more  than  64,000  photo  prints,  and 
coordinated end of term archiving of more than 77,000 photo images for Senators.  
PRINTING, GRAPHICS AND DIRECT MAIL 
Printing, Graphics and Direct Mail (PGDM) provides support to the Senate community through 
graphic design, printing, photocopying, mailing, document preservation, logistics, and security—
completing more than 45,900 job requests and 2,650 various deliveries throughout the Capitol Hill 
campus and offsite locations during FY 2017.  
As a good steward of fiscal resources, PGDM garnered notable savings for the Senate, including: 
•  Reducing equipment maintenance costs by $74,000 through re-negotiating contracts. 
•  Saving more than $1.1 million by locally producing charts for Senate floor proceedings 
and committee hearings in spite of a 12% increase in production. 
•  Saving more than $855,000 in postage by pre-sorting and discounting 3.7 million pieces of 
outgoing Senate franked mail. 
8 
Digital publications and multimedia are becoming an increasingly important complement to 
printing. In FY 2017, PGDM leveraged applications such as Adobe Creative Suite to create and 
host rich interactive HTML5 documents. PGDM can now create more integrated campaigns by 
using digital technology and creating both print and digital editions to extend our content delivery 
to computers, tablets, and smartphones. 
PGDM has incorporated electronic forms, allowing Senate offices to efficiently convert paper-
based processes (fax machines/fillable PDF submissions) to web-based service. The electronic 
form provides internal and external users a process to collect data efficiently and accurately, while 
streamlining operations such as tracking, auditing, and reporting, without having to invest in IT 
infrastructure or software developers. In FY 2017, the electronic State Office Form allowed Senate 
D.C. and state offices the ability to submit over 1,700 forms containing monthly postal charges for 
financial accounting purposes. 
In FY 2017, PGDM’s Senate Support Facility upheld the SAA mission for operational security by 
receiving 5,381,526 items from the U.S. Capitol Police offsite inspection facility and transferring 
them to the Senate Support Facility. This process eliminated 423 truck deliveries to the Capitol 
Complex, reducing traffic and allowing the USCP to focus on other aspects of safety. 
SENATE POST OFFICE 
The  Senate  Post  Office’s  workforce  tests  and  delivers  mail  and  packages  to  more  than 
180 locations within the Capitol Complex, while providing a messenger service to multiple 
locations within the Washington metropolitan area. In FY 2017, the Senate Post Office safely 
processed and delivered 11.9 million incoming mail items. The Government Accountability Office 
reimbursed the SAA $11,000 for screening their incoming U.S. Postal Service mail. The Senate 
Post Office purchased 150 additional mail-screening workstations for Senate state offices to 
replace older units. Additional mail screening workstations will be purchased in the next year to 
ensure availability of the most current equipment for all state staff.  
CAPITOL FACILITIES 
Capitol Facilities supports the work of the Senate by providing a clean, professional environment 
in the Capitol for Senators, staff, and visitors. Our Environmental Services Division cleans Capitol 
offices, hallways, and restrooms; moves furniture for offices; and provides special event setups for 
15 meeting rooms in the Capitol and the Senate Expansion space in the Capitol Visitor Center. 
The Furnishings Division provides furnishings—including stock and custom furniture, carpeting, 
and window treatments to Capitol offices. It also provides framing services for Senate offices and 
committees.  Focus  continues  on  realizing  cost  savings  and  improved  efficiency,  while  not 
sacrificing service. Capitol Facilities has combined job specialties and engaged in cross-training 
employees to ensure services are maintained at the highest level. Current initiatives include 
ongoing upgrades to our online work order system to notify staff of new work orders, track 
workloads, and provide 3D furnishing floorplans to Senators for use in their Capitol offices.  
OFFICE SUPPORT SERVICES 
The State Office Liaison staff serve as the conduit between Senate offices and commercial 
landlords,  or  the  General  Services  Administration  for  Senate  offices  in  federal  facilities, 
overseeing 450 state offices. Managing this important program helps assure every Senator’s ability 
to meet the growing needs of their local constituencies.

CAPITOL OPERATIONS 
Ensuring  that  our  customers—both  internal  and  external—have  access  to  the  Senate  and 
understand its work remains the focus of the SAA’s Capitol Operations team. Over the past year, 
team members provided a range of services to Senators and their staffs, visitors to the Capitol, 
members of the news media who cover Congress, and the public. Capitol Operations continues to 
focus on providing timely, accurate, and useful information that promotes safety, increases 
transparency, and enhances the experience of those who work in and visit the Senate.  
SENATE RECORDING STUDIO  
In a time of instant communication and demands for transparency, the Senate Recording Studio 
ensures the Senate’s work remains accessible to the public. During 2017, the Recording Studio 
provided 1,166 hours of gavel-to-gavel coverage of Senate floor proceedings and continues to 
provide technical support for live streaming and archiving of the proceedings on the Senate’s 
website, www.senate.gov. Last year, the streamed proceedings were viewed 6.02 million times, an 
increase of 180% over 2016. Additionally in 2017, 586,295 unique visitors visited the site, an 
increase of 239% over the previous year. To keep the quality of this production in line with current 
standards, the studio upgraded the Senate floor audio system in 2017. The Recording Studio also 
broadcast  750  Senate  committee  hearings  in  2017,  a  38%  increase  over  2016.  The  studio 
coordinates with Voice of America, the Department of State, and other agencies to provide these 
hearings to a larger audience. Another priority of the Recording Studio is to enable Senators 
working in D.C. to communicate with their constituents back home. During 2017, the studio 
produced 1,037 television productions, an increase of 29% over the previous year. Additionally, 
the studio produced 1,308 radio productions, a 46% increase over 2016. 
SENATE MEDIA GALLERIES  
For members of the news media, the Senate remains one of the most open and accessible 
institutions of government. On any given day, hundreds of reporters, producers, photographers, 
videographers, and technical support personnel can be found in hearing rooms, hallways, and in 
the Chamber, bringing the news of the Senate to people across the country and around the world.  
The four Senate Media Galleries ensure the news media can conduct business efficiently, safely, 
and in a manner consistent with Senate rules. The unique structure of the Media Galleries, dating 
back to the earliest days of the Senate, requires close cooperation with the Standing and Executive 
Correspondents’ Committees, the USCP, and press secretaries and communications staff of 
Senators’ offices and committees. Media Gallery staff facilitate media credentials and arrange for 
more than 7,000 members of the news media to cover the Senate each year. In the past year, the 
number of media credentials issued has risen 18%. 
Daily Press Gallery  
Last year, the Daily Press Gallery issued credentials to approximately 1,600 journalists. As 
custodians  of  the  largest  press  complex  on  Capitol  Hill,  the  gallery  staff  serve  more  than 
100 reporters who work in the Press Gallery on a regular basis. Gallery staff control access to the 
Press Gallery inside the Senate Chamber and ensure gallery rules are followed. They coordinate 
with Senate committees on press coverage for hearings and other events around Capitol Hill. The 
staff remain focused on modernizing services, streamlining the online credentialing process, and 
maintaining real time website updates on Senate floor proceedings and notifications to Senate staff 
and reporters via email and Twitter (@SenatePress).  
10 
Periodical Press Gallery  
The Periodical Press Gallery supports the news media working for non-daily periodicals and their 
online publications. Media presence on Capitol Hill has increased dramatically over the past year, 
and gallery staff help maintain crowd control in the Senate subway and the Ohio Clock Corridor 
during votes and party caucus meetings. Gallery staff continue to process new press applications 
in consultation with the Executive Committee of Periodical Correspondents, and renew press 
credentials for approximately 1,200 correspondents. The staff remain focused on streamlining 
communication with gallery members and Senate staff. For example, the number of followers to 
the gallery’s Twitter account (@Senate PPG) grew over 23% in 2017 to 7,486 followers. These 
efforts help drive traffic to the gallery’s website, where information on Senate floor proceedings, 
the credentialing process, and Senate factoids are consolidated.  
Press Photographers Gallery  
The Press Photographers Gallery supports photographers representing news organizations from 
across the United States and around the world. Last year, the gallery credentialed approximately 
300 news photographers. Unlike the other three Media Galleries, which have counterparts in the 
House of Representatives, Press Photographers Gallery staff support the media at news events and 
hearings for both Houses of Congress. During the past year, gallery staff supported press logistics 
at many high profile hearings and events. The gallery staff work with other SAA offices, the U.S. 
Capitol Police, and Senate offices to ensure press photographers have access without interfering 
with the duties of the Members. Additionally, the gallery is fine-tuning the press logistics for 
Continuity of Government plans. 
Radio and Television Gallery  
The Radio and Television Gallery serves as the Senate’s primary contact to the broadcast news, 
ensuring the Senate’s broadcast coverage rules are followed. Gallery staff function as liaisons 
between Senate offices and the broadcast media. In 2017, staff assisted in organizing coverage of 
more than 200 news conferences, 1,400 committee hearings, 160 photo opportunities, and 40 
special events—a significant increase over the previous year. The gallery issued credentials to 
approximately 4,000 television and radio reporters, producers, and technical personnel. The gallery 
also maintains the studio and technical infrastructure Senators use for news conferences. 
SENATE DOORKEEPERS 
Senate Doorkeepers play a critical role in supporting the legislative process. They provide access 
to those with Senate floor privileges; enforce the rules of the Senate floor; and facilitate the needs 
of Senators, Senate floor staff, and Senate Pages. Doorkeepers also provide support for a number 
of special events attended by Senators, their families, and special guests. In addition to directly 
supporting Senators, Doorkeepers ensure people from around the world can visit the Senate 
Galleries safely. Doorkeepers are also tasked with emergency preparedness roles, and balance the 
dual priorities of maintaining access and preparing for emergency situations. 
SENATE APPOINTMENT DESKS  
The Senate Appointment Desks are responsible for processing thousands of guests who enter the 
Capitol each year for business meetings or other purposes in a safe and efficient manner. During 
2017, approximately 220,000 visitors were processed through our network of Appointment Desks 
located on the first floor of the Capitol, in the basements of the Russell and Hart Senate office 
buildings, and in the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC). Of these, 116,000 visitors were in the Capitol 
Complex for official business or for a meeting with a Member, a Member’s office, or a committee. 
11 
In addition, more than 29,000 international visitors relied on the CVC Appointment Desk for 
Senate Gallery Passes and information. 
SAA HUMAN RESOURCES 
The SAA Office of Human Resources provides personnel services and advice to SAA managers 
and employees. In addition, SAA Human Resources provides workers’ compensation, ergonomic 
assessments, Americans with Disabilities Act accommodation requests, and recruitment services 
to the broader Senate community. During FY 2017, the Senate Placement Office received 590 
requests for recruitment assistance from Senate offices and processed 29,304 resumes, with 2,088 
resumes collected and referred. Overall, in FY 2017, the Placement Office processed 35,435 
resumes from applicants for Senate employment. 
SENATE OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING 
The Office of Education and Training ensures all Senate staff have the resources and skills needed 
to perform their jobs. In 2017, nearly 3,000 staff attended in-person classes and over 1,400 attended 
online classes. The office facilitated three conferences for over 170 state staff, and provided 
customized training, facilitation services, and coaching to Members, committees, and support 
offices, in which more than 2,000 staff members participated. This year, the office plans to 
continue to offer leadership development, introduce training opportunities for administrative 
directors and chief clerks, and increase the library of online lessons. 
The Health Promotion section within Education and Training provides mandated health promotion 
activities and events for the Senate community. Each year, the office coordinates and hosts the 
two-day Health and Wellness Fair. In 2017, more than 2,100 staff participated in health promotion 
activities,  which  included  screenings  for  glucose,  cholesterol,  and  blood  pressure;  exercise 
demonstrations; and seminars on topics including healthy eating and cancer prevention.  
EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
Our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) offers a variety of emotional, behavioral and work-
related support resources and services to staff, their family members, Senate Pages, and interns. In 
2017, nearly 1 in 20 Senate employees used the services of an EAP counselor; 181 employees took 
an online mental health screening; 31 managers requested a supervisory consultation; 2,862 
employees attended an EAP training activity; and 1,593 employees’ accessed resources for 
personalized  information  and  referrals  addressing  childcare,  parenting,  adult  care,  aging, 
education, legal concerns, and/or financial issues. 
CONCLUSION 
The SAA organization is composed of a diverse array of departments. All of them exist to serve 
the Senate so that it can function as part of the Legislative Branch of our government. To provide 
the checks and balances on any administration, the Legislative Branch must be able to function 
efficiently in an effort to create and pass legislation. To do so, the Senate SAA must and will 
provide the needed services that allow the Legislative Branch to function.

AND 
 
GENERAL MARK A. MILLEY 
CHIEF OF STAFF 
UNITED STATES ARMY 
 
 
BEFORE THE 
 
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE – DEFENSE 
 
SECOND SESSION, 115TH CONGRESS 
 
ON THE POSTURE OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY 
MAY 15, 2018 
 
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION 
UNTIL RELEASED BY THE COMMITTEE 
   
Introduction  
America’s Army is lethal and effective. Our lethality provides the assured capability to 
defeat enemy ground forces through sustained land campaigns in defense of our vital 
national interests. To maintain our land power dominance, we will concentrate our efforts on 
our priorities—Readiness, Modernization, and Reform—to ensure America's Army is always 
ready, now and in the future. We also live by enduring priorities to take care of our Soldiers, 
Civilians, and their Families; to re-commit to the Army values and warrior ethos that guide us; 
and to strengthen relationships with allies and partners.     
We thank Congress for its strong support, which has enabled the Army to halt the 
decline in our warfighting readiness. Importantly though, the Army needs timely, predictable, 
adequate, and sustained funding to preserve these readiness gains now and in the future. 
The Army's fiscal year 2019 (FY19) budget prioritizes our resources based on the President's 
guidance, and our strategy is consistent with the National Defense Strategy. This year's 
budget allows us to continue to build readiness for high intensity conflict and begin building 
our future force through key modernization efforts. It also enables us to continue to take care 
of our people and institute reforms across the Army to free up time, money, and manpower. 
Army leadership, with congressional support, is committed to ensuring America's Army is 
ready now and modernizing for the future. 
Strategic Environment  
Our Army faces a complex and demanding strategic environment. This will require the 
Army to remain ready for a wide range of missions to defend American interests. We must 
build readiness for high-intensity conflict and modernize our forces to ensure overmatch 
against near-peer competitors, while sustaining irregular warfare as a core competency.   
Our competitors are seeking to alter global strategic realities for their own benefit, 
often at the expense of U.S. interests and those of our allies and partners. Russia and China 
continue to assert themselves in an effort to gain dominance in key regions, and are 
developing advanced weapons to achieve parity both strategically and in close combat. North 
Korea has pursued nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles for decades with significant 
advances over the last year. Iran is attempting to expand its regional influence by developing 
more advanced ballistic missiles and supporting insurgent groups against U.S. allies in the 
region. Additionally, these state actors use a range of actions short of armed conflict, from 
1 
 
cyber-attacks to irregular warfare through proxies that destabilize regions without attribution. 
Finally, terrorist groups continue to threaten the U.S. homeland, U.S. citizens, U.S. interests 
abroad, and our allies and partners.  
Soldiers directly contribute to our Nation’s efforts to counter these challenges by 
serving combatant commanders worldwide with over 178,000 Soldiers operating across a 
wide array of missions. The Army is committed to maintaining peace, stability, and security in 
the Asia-Pacific with nearly 80,000 Soldiers assigned, deployed, and forward-stationed 
throughout the region. 24,000 Soldiers continue to deter North Korean aggression, with the 
Army focused on building readiness to respond to any contingency, including potential 
conflict. In Europe, the Army has over 30,000 forward stationed and rotational forces. In the 
Middle East, the troop increase in Afghanistan has already begun to advance the train, 
advise, and assist mission at the tactical level. In support of homeland defense, the Army 
provides over 15,000 Soldiers as well as a Global Response Force of 9,500 personnel, 
capable of deploying anywhere in the world within 96 hours. Over the last year, Army forces 
were critical in disaster relief efforts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands resulting from 
Hurricanes Maria and Irma, the California wild fires and mud slides, and widespread flooding 
in the central United States.    
The Army’s competitive advantage is our Soldiers’ ability to rapidly deploy when and 
where required, gain and maintain overmatch, and achieve decisive victory against any 
adversary. This produces a combat-credible deterrent against potential adversaries who are 
hostile to our Nation’s interests. Sustained, predictable, adequate, and timely funding will 
secure the Army’s ability to continue to defend our Nation’s interests. 
The Army’s Budget Request  
The Army’s total FY19 budget request totals $182.1B which consists of $148.4B in the 
base budget and $33.7B for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). This represents an 
eight percent increase over our total FY18 President’s Budget plus amendments. Our request 
reflects the Army’s priorities: grow and maintain a ready high-end force; build our future force 
through key modernization efforts; continue to take care of our people; and institute reforms 
that lead the Army to be even better stewards of taxpayer dollars.

Readiness to Fight Tonight  
       Ready forces ensure that the Army can compete against our adversaries, deter 
conflict, and win decisively. FY17 and FY18 authorizations and FY17 appropriations provided 
critical support to fill manning requirements, fund important gains to training such as 
increasing combat training center rotations, increasing equipment operational readiness 
rates, building and modernizing Army Prepositioned Stocks, and beginning to address 
munitions shortfalls. Barring a significant increase in demand for land forces, the Army will 
attain our Total Force readiness recovery goals in 2022. To ensure that we meet this goal, we 
need predictable, adequate, sustained, timely funding, enabling us to sufficiently organize, 
man, train, and equip our formations.  
We are growing the Army by both recruiting and retaining physically fit, mentally tough 
Soldiers without lowering standards. Increased end strength has enabled the Army to fill 
manning shortfalls in key formations. Soldiers within the ranks are also increasingly 
deployable, with a four percent decrease in Regular Army non-deployable rates over the past 
year, and an overall goal of a five percent non-deployable rate by FY21. Contributing to this is 
increased holistic fitness, improved medical tracking, unit injury prevention and physical 
therapy programs, and leveraging end strength increases to raise operational unit manning 
levels. These are accompanied by new policies intended to rebuild a culture of deployability 
across the force. As a result, the number of brigade combat teams (BCTs) in the highest 
state of personnel readiness has more than doubled.  
Tough, realistic training is key to maintaining our competitive advantage in the current 
security environment. In order to increase Soldiers’ opportunity to conduct training focused on 
lethality, we have reduced, and will continue to reduce, ancillary mandatory training, 
requirements, and distractions at home station. We are also using virtual simulations to 
increase training repetitions for small units, creating greater proficiency at unit collective 
tasks. Leaders across the Army are taking steps to ensure a predictable training 
management cycle, and returning our training focus to preparation for a high-end fight 
validated at combat training centers. However, these units can only remain ready if they 
remain together, so we must also find innovative ways to meet combatant command demand 
without breaking apart our baseline combat formations. 
3 
 
An important part of the Army’s effort to maintain the readiness of the Army’s BCTs for 
major combat operations is the security force assistance brigade (SFAB). The SFAB will 
provide combatant commanders with a skilled advisory force to team with our security 
partners worldwide. Previously, we assigned BCTs to conduct advisory missions, breaking 
those formations apart. The first SFAB deployed to Afghanistan in the spring of 2018. We 
request congressional support to man, train, and equip six SFABs: five in the Regular Army 
and one in the Army National Guard. 
In addition to improved training, our Army must have sufficient equipment. We are 
modernizing our equipment, refining our supply distribution systems, and enhancing our 
Prepositioned Stocks to balance our capabilities across multiple threats and theaters. 
However, we continue to have shortages of some critical preferred munitions. As a result, 
Holston Army Ammunition Plant in Tennessee is expanding production capacity, and Pine 
Bluff Arsenal in Arkansas and McAlester Army Ammunition Plant in Oklahoma are beginning 
repair and upgrade programs. We request congressional support as we continue to reform 
and align requirements and resources within the Organic Industrial Base. 
Modernization:  Ready for the Future Fight    
Over the past decade, the Army made necessary but difficult choices to defer 
modernization in order to support combat operations. We upgraded current weapons systems 
rather than acquire new or next generation technologies. However, we can no longer afford to 
delay modernization without risking overmatch on future battlefields. Thanks to congressional 
support, the Army now has the means to modestly increase investments towards 
modernization and lay the groundwork for increased funding in the coming years. To improve 
modernization we will focus on three things. First, we will establish the Army Futures 
Command to reform our acquisition process through unity of command, unity of effort, and 
increased accountability. Second, through the efforts of eight cross functional teams, we will 
focus these additional resources towards six modernization priorities to ensure future 
overmatch. Third, Army leadership will strengthen our relationship with industry, our allies, 
and the top intellectual and innovative talent our Nation has to offer. Collectively, these 
improvements and others will help ensure our lethality and future readiness. 
   The Army must adapt quicker than our adversaries to maintain our competitive 
advantage. This is the rationale for the Army Futures Command. The formal establishment of 
4 
 
Army Futures Command in the summer of 2018 will represent the most significant 
organizational change to the Army’s structure since 1973. The new command will consolidate 
the Acquisition process under one organization with a mission to deliver integrated solutions 
for increased lethality and capabilities to the Soldier when and where they are needed.  
The FY19 budget coupled with our reforms will enable the Army to accelerate 
upgrades to critical capabilities, managing current risk while we innovate and prototype with a 
goal to begin fielding the next generation of combat vehicles, aerial platforms, and weapons 
systems by 2028. These vehicles and weapons must be better than anything our adversaries 
will deploy in the future. We will focus modernization, science and technology, and research 
and development efforts on six modernization priorities, managed and assessed by eight 
cross functional teams:  
•  Long Range Precision Fires—modernize a cannon for extended range, volume, and 
increased missile capabilities to restore Army dominance in range. Systems like the 
Extended Range Cannon Artillery, which has been accelerated to FY23, and the Long 
Range Precision Fires Missile, accelerated to FY21 protect and ensure freedom of 
maneuver to forces in contact with the enemy in deep, close, and rear operations. The 
Army has included $73.7M for Long Range Precision Fires in the FY18 Enhancement 
Request, with $22M in additional requested funds in the FY19 President’s Budget. 
•  Next Generation of Combat Vehicles—develop prototypes that lead to the replacement of 
our current fleet of infantry fighting vehicles, and later tanks, in manned, unmanned, and 
optionally manned variants. A next generation vehicle is needed to enhance Soldier 
protection, increase mobility, and make our forces more lethal. Prototypes for both 
manned and robotic vehicles will arrive in FY21, with $13.1M requested in the FY18 
Enhancement, and $84M in the FY19 President’s Budget.  
•  Future Vertical Lift—incorporate manned, unmanned, and optionally manned variant 
vertical lift platforms that provide superior speed, range, endurance, altitude, and payload 
capabilities. These include the Future Unmanned Aircraft System, which is undergoing 
experimentation and will be prototyped in FY24, and the Modular Open System Approach, 
a software prototype that has been accelerated from FY28 to FY26. $25.1M is included in 
the FY18 Enhancement Request for Future Vertical Lift, with additional funds included in 
the FY19 President’s Budget. 
5 
 
•  Network—develop expeditionary infrastructure solutions to fight reliably on the move in 
any environment. The Army Network should incorporate electronic warfare; resilient, 
secure, and interoperable hardware; software and information systems; assured position, 
navigation, and timing; and low signature networks. $180M is included in the FY18 
Enhancement Request to conduct Network related experimentation next fiscal year, 
including an Infantry Brigade at the Joint Readiness Training Center this summer, and a 
Stryker Brigade by early 2019. 
•  Air and Missile Defense—ensure our future combat formations are protected from modern 
and advanced air and missile delivered fires, including drones. We are focusing on 
capabilities that include Mobile Short-Range Air Defense with directed energy and 
advanced energetics. We are also accelerating the fielding of existing air defense 
capabilities over the coming years. 
•  Soldier Lethality—develop the next generation of individual and squad weapons; improve 
body armor, sensors, and radios; and develop a synthetic training environment that 
simulates the modern battlefield, allowing our Soldiers multiple iterations before they ever 
deploy. The FY18 Enhancement Request includes $81M to experiment and procure 
Enhanced Night Vision Goggles by FY21. 
These modernization priorities illustrate how our Army will adapt to future threats. The 
cross functional teams are the driving force for the modernization priorities. Each cross 
functional team uses technical experimentation and demonstrations, in conjunction with 
increased engagement with industry and commercial sector partners, to inform prototype 
development and reduce the requirement process.  
The Army remains concerned about preserving key skills and capabilities for our 
original equipment manufacturers and their key supplier bases. Collaboration with our private 
sector partners early in the process helps reduce risk. Efforts such as the Army 
Manufacturing Technology Program have provided affordable and timely manufacturing 
solutions that assist our industry partners to address manufacturing risks. Collectively, 
congressional support for the Army Futures Command, implementation of the future 
recommendations of the cross functional teams, and a strong relationship with the 
commercial base has one simple goal: make Soldiers more lethal and ready for the future. 
6 
 
Reform 
To achieve these objectives, we are assessing everything we do across the Army, 
looking for ways to free up time, money, and manpower for our top priorities. In support of 
DOD reform efforts, we have placed increased emphasis on a number of business reforms 
and stewardship initiatives. Specifically, we are instituting Army-wide programs that address 
Acquisition Reform; Contract Management; Budget Execution; divestiture and consolidation 
of legacy information technology systems; and auditability of our resources.  
The Army’s Acquisition Reform Initiative shortens the development timeline and 
approval process of capabilities requirements. This reform initiative directs the consolidation 
of two oversight groups into one and provides Army leadership with access to decisions 
earlier in the decision cycle. The Army is creating strategic enterprise metrics through policies 
and procedures intended to drive significant savings from the reform of contracted services 
per year from 2020 to 2024. We are also monitoring de-obligating funds through the 
Command Accountability and Execution Review to increase Army annual buying power. 
Additionally, we are improving our auditability. This year, we plan to complete an independent 
audit that will further enable the Army to improve our business practices and management of 
our resources.  
Another key area of reform is in Army institutions. We are undertaking efforts to 
optimize non-divisional two-star headquarters and above to enable faster decision making. 
We are beginning by optimizing key essential tasks at the Army Secretariat, Army Staff, and 
Army Commands to address manning requirement needs at the division level and below. 
Next, revised experimentation and war gaming will accelerate new Army warfighting doctrine, 
providing a comprehensive framework to underpin how we train and how we fight. And finally, 
a new talent management based personnel system will optimize individuals’ effectiveness 
and professional development, and ensure we develop and retain exceptional Leaders and 
Soldiers of unmatched lethality.  
Soldiers, Civilians, and Families: Our Greatest Asset  
       The United States Army is composed of Regular Army, Army National Guard, and 
Army Reserve Soldiers, Civilians, and Family members serving the Nation at home and 
abroad. The quality of Soldiers the Army attracts and retains is extremely high. Quality 
metrics for Army recruits are at their highest point, exceeding every DOD-mandated 
7 
 
education and aptitude threshold for the eighth year in a row. Waivers for recruits are down 
nearly eight percent over the past decade. The Army’s long term success depends on 
developing smart, innovative leaders of character who bring a wide range of skills and 
experiences to our ranks. We will remain a standards-based organization and maintain the 
values that we have established for those who enter and serve the Army and for those 
Soldiers who remain for a career. We will not lower standards to meet our end strength goals. 
  The Army is committed to taking care of our Soldiers, Civilians, and their Families by 
maintaining opportunities for promotions and schooling, providing attractive career options, 
and continuing quality of life programs. We ensure the well-being of our people through 
world-class medical services, quality facilities to live and work, and child care and youth 
services. New civilian hiring initiatives for spouses promise to accelerate work opportunities 
on Army installations, while other reforms may allow them to sustain careers by reducing the 
frequency of moves. The cumulative effect of these programs is to increase retention through 
increased satisfaction with Army life.  
We also take care of individual Soldiers and strengthen teams through Sexual 
Harassment/Assault Prevention and Response initiatives, active Suicide Prevention 
measures, Army Warrior Care, and transition assistance through our Soldier for Life program. 
In particular, a new task force is addressing suicide reduction in the Army National Guard and 
Army Reserve. Taking care of our people ensures Soldiers and Families have the support 
they need to focus on preparing to deploy, fight, and win our Nation’s wars. 
Conclusion  
  On behalf of the entire Army, we thank Congress for their support that allows us to 
continue to improve readiness and make an increased investment in our future Army. Our 
current security environment continues to have numerous challenges, and they are growing. 
With predictable, adequate, sustained, and timely funding, we will increase capacity, train 
advisory forces, close critical munitions gaps, improve modernization, and take care of our 
Soldiers, Civilians, and their Families. We are a standards-based organization accountable to 
Congress and the American people. We know that the only acceptable result of our efforts is 
a lethal Army, ready now, and prepared for the future.

  WRITTEN TESTIMONY BY SECRETARY WILBUR ROSS 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 
FISCAL YEAR 2019 BUDGET REQUEST 
 
Chairman Moran, Ranking Member Shaheen, and members of the Senate 
Appropriations Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to discuss President 
Trump’s Fiscal Year 2019 Budget Request for the U.S. Department of Commerce.  
 
Thank you for enabling the Department to meet its major strategic objectives of 
helping the American economy grow, and ensuring our national security.  We are 
accomplishing this by supporting investment and job creation; preparing for a 
successful 2020 Decennial Census; bolstering trade enforcement and export 
controls; and providing the observational infrastructure and personnel to develop 
timely and accurate weather forecasts.   
 
Under my stewardship, our resource allocations in the FY 2019 Budget are 
centrally focused on helping American businesses and industries compete globally 
while improving the economic conditions and everyday lives of the American 
people and their communities.  
 
To that end, the Department of Commerce’s FY 2019 Budget Request of $9.8 
billion in funding is a ($1.3 billion decrease from the FY 2018 omnibus ($11.1 
billion).  This does not include the $1.0 billion that was recently appropriated to 
the Department as part of the supplemental assistance package enacted in the 
aftermath of severe storms in Texas, Florida, and other U.S. territories (the 
Economic Development Administration was provided $600 million and the 
National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration was allocated $400 million). 
 
The FY 2019 Budget carries forward key strategic investments from FY 2018 and 
introduces new initiatives that I believe are critical to sustaining the economic 
momentum that we have established.   
 
Our laser focus remains on helping the American Economy grow.  The 
Department’s FY 2019 Budget recognizes the challenges facing American workers 
and businesses as they attempt to navigate a rapidly changing and increasingly 
competitive world.   
 
I believe the budget request is uniquely tailored to leverage the innovation, talent, 
expertise, and technological prowess of the Department’s programs, projects, and 
activities to ensure businesses and the American people are receiving a good return 
on their taxpayer investments.   
 
   
 
By prioritizing our industries, trade and economic advantages, and our workforce, 
we will continue to be an economic engine, both in the United States and around 
the world. 
 
I look forward to working with this Committee and the rest of the Congress to 
achieve our shared goals on behalf of the Nation’s taxpayers.  For more 
information about the Department’s FY 2019 Budget, please visit the Department’s 
Web site at: http://www.osec.doc.gov/bmi/budget/FY19_CBJ.html.

Highlights of the FY 2019 Commerce Budget Request 
 
CENSUS:  
 
The 2020 Decennial Census is the Department’s top priority.  A complete and 
accurate Decennial Census is critical as it informs the policy making process, 
governs the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives allocated to the 
States, and helps direct more than $675 billion annually in Federal funds to local 
communities to improve homeland security, education, and infrastructure.   
 
To support this critical endeavor, the Department’s FY 2019 Budget requests $3.8 
billion for the Census Bureau, $3.1 billion of which will directly support 2020 
Census operations.  The proposed $1 billion increase from the FY 2018 Omnibus 
reflects the Department’s commitment to count everyone once and in the right 
place.  The Census Bureau appreciates Congress’ support for the decennial census 
and the inclusion of an additional $1.1 billion beyond the program’s estimate for 
2018 (including contingency funds) in the 2018 Omnibus appropriations act.  
These funds will help provide financial certainty to the program as we transition 
from FY 2018 to FY 2019, and represent a down payment on the $3.1 billion 
requested in 2019 to continue all preparatory activities and existing field 
operations. 
 
Key activities for the 2020 Census will take place in 2019. We will be making final 
refinements for all systems to ensure they meet all requirements, are secured, 
tested, and are seamlessly integrated. The field offices and other field infrastructure 
will be stood up nationwide. 
 
We will be increasing the number of Partnership Specialists to our planned level of 
1,000. This staff will work throughout 2019 to build the network of approximately 
300,000 census partners who will be the trusted voices to encourage communities 
across the nation to respond to the 2020 Census. We will also begin the full-scale 
development and implementation of all aspects of the Communications Program. 
 
We will conduct the first major field operation: In-Field Address Canvassing.  
Approximately 76,000 field listers and supervisors will be trained and sent into the 
field to complete this difficult and important work.  
 
The 2020 Census questionnaire and materials will be finalized. We will also 
finalize and secure all operations and systems related to the use of administrative 
3 
 
records and third-party data and ensure they are working together in preparation 
for use in the 2020 Census. 
 
TRADE:  
 
When President Trump tapped me to serve as the Commerce Secretary, I vowed to 
work hard to reduce the nation’s trade deficit.  Increased enforcement of our trade 
laws has been a major effort in this regard. 
 
Approximately $440 million is requested in the Department’s FY 2019 Budget for 
the International Trade Administration (ITA).  ITA will use the requested funding 
to hire more subject matter experts and enhance its trade enforcement and analysis 
capacity as it relates to antidumping and countervailing duty and Section 232 
investigations.   
 
The FY 2019 Budget includes more than $90 million, an increase of $3 million, for 
ITA’s enforcement and compliance programs.  This funding will enable ITA to 
conduct robust investigations into alleged trade violations and aggressively 
advocate for U.S. businesses facing tariff and non-tariff barriers abroad. A portion 
of this would be specifically allocated to Department of Commerce self-initiation 
efforts on behalf of American workers and businesses.   
  
Trade is also closely linked to our national security. Separately, in 2017, the 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) successfully completed 13 administrative 
enforcement cases, with total civil penalties of $692,296,500—the highest annual 
level of civil penalties in the history of the Bureau.   
 
To continue building on these important enforcement and national security 
initiatives, $121 million is requested in the FY 2019 Budget for BIS, a $7.0 million 
increase from the 2018 omnibus.  This increased funding will enable BIS to hire 
additional staff to address the increased workload associated with expanded export 
controls to protect our technology and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the 
United States (CFIUS).  The International Trade Administration is also provided 
with additional funding for CFIUS to support its ability to detailed sector reviews 
required under CFIUS and perform its role as the Department’s CFIUS 
coordinator.  
 
 
 
 
4 
 
WEATHER SATELLITES: 
 
With its $1.6 billion request for the National Environmental Satellite and 
Data Information Service (NESDIS), NOAA will continue its work to 
deploy the next generation of weather satellites and observational 
infrastructure.  The FY 2019 Budget includes $878 million for the Polar 
Weather Satellites, which supports continued work on the Joint Polar 
Satellite System -2 (JPSS-2) and allows the program to maintain the 
previously scheduled Launch Readiness Dates of second quarter in 2024 for 
JPSS-3 and the fourth quarter of 2026 for JPSS-4.   
 
The Budget meets this objective, while lowering overall costs, by combining 
the current JPSS Program of Record (POR) with the Polar Follow On (PFO) 
program into a single program, allowing NOAA to more efficiently manage 
the acquisition of these satellites.  The JPSS satellites provide space-based 
observations that are critical data for weather forecast models in support of 
forecasting short, mid- and long term severe weather events.   
 
The FY19 Budget also fully funds ($408.4 million) continued work on the 
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) Series, 
including the continued development of the third and fourth satellites of the 
series, GOES-T and GOES-U.  On March 1, 2018, NESDIS launched 
GOES-S (now known as GOES-17), the second of the GOES-R Series. 
GOES-17 will move to a western position to join its sister satellite, GOES-
EAST (GOES-16).  Together, these satellites will provide faster, more 
accurate, and more detailed data than legacy satellites to track storm 
systems, lightning, wildfires, coastal fog, and other hazards.  These satellites 
will observe the majority of the Western Hemisphere from the west coast of 
Africa all the way to New Zealand. 
 
SPACE COMMERCE: 
 
Commerce’s FY19 budget also emphasizes the Department’s efforts to 
better advocate for and remove undue regulatory barriers on the commercial 
space industry.  The FY19 Budget allocates $1.8M to NOAA’s Office of 
Space Commerce and $1.8M to the Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory 
Affairs Office, up from $1.2M and $1.8M in FY18.  This modest increase 
will enable DOC to begin executing directives received from the 
Administration and the National Space Council to take on further 
responsibilities relating to space commerce.  DOC will continue to play a 
5 
 
more active role in the National Space Council’s recommendations to 
advance American leadership in commercial space activities by promoting a 
robust and responsive U.S. industry.   
 
The Department will also conduct an extensive regulatory analysis to inform 
an updated remote sensing licensing process that will facilitate continued 
growth of this critical industry.  The Administration has also designated 
Commerce as the new civil agency lead for space traffic management and 
space situational awareness.  Commerce will take on a leadership role for 
these and other policy initiatives as the Administration works to ensure that 
America is the flag of choice for business in space. 
 
Streamlining Government Operations and Improving Efficiency 
 
The Department’s FY 2019 resource allocations are designed to fuel American 
prosperity, the national economy, and the nation’s taxpayers.  Difficult tradeoffs 
have to be made for which Commerce programs are prioritized. 
 
The FY 2019 Budget seeks to transform MBDA into a policy-focused operation 
that can better assist minority businesses across America.  Consistent with this 
transformation, the Budget proposes to eliminate funding for MBDA’s business 
centers.   
 
Instead, MBDA’s FY 2019 Budget will allot its present 50 positions for this new 
endeavor, which seeks to ensure minority entrepreneurs have access to the 
resources they need to create jobs and help fuel the Nation’s prosperity. 
 
Similar to the Department’s budget request in FY 2018, the FY 2019 Budget once 
again proposes significant savings to maximize every taxpayer dollar.  These 
initiatives include eliminating the Economic Development Administration (EDA).   
These proposals are consistent with the approach throughout the Budget to focus 
on core federal missions and reduce lower priority expenditures, such as grants. 
 
The proposed elimination of EDA’s grant-making functions and salaries and 
expenses would result in an approximately $300 million savings. 
   
We are also once again recommending the discontinuation of federal funding for 
the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program, which 
subsidizes up to half the cost of state centers that provide consulting services to 
small- and medium-sized manufacturers.  This would result in a projected savings 
6 
 
of $125 million.  There has been enough private sector support for this program 
that we believe it can function well without the need for Federal money. 
 
NOAA is once again proposing to reduce or eliminate a number of its 
external grant programs, which total approximately $493 million.   
 
This includes approximately $76.5  million for NOAA’s National Sea Grant 
College and Marine Aquaculture grant programs (the FY 2018 omnibus 
provided $65.0 million for the sea grant program and $11.5 million for 
marine aquaculture); a $75 million reduction to the National Ocean 
Service’s Coastal Zone Management and the Regional Coastal Resilience 
grant programs; and $65 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery 
Fund (PCSRF), which provide resources to restore and conserve Pacific 
salmon and steelhead.   
 
Finally, NOAA is re-proposing to terminate the Office of Education for a 
savings of $$28 million from the FY 2018 omnibus. This includes 
terminating the Competitive Education Grants and Educational Partnership 
Program with Minority Serving Institutions (EPP/MSI) grants.  The Budget 
further proposes to end the Bay-Watershed Educational and Training (B-
Wet) Regional Programs (a $7.5 million decrease from the FY 2018 
omnibus).   
 
NOAA will continue to provide watershed educational experiences for 
students through other programs, including National Marine Sanctuaries.

Statement by Alex M. Azar II 
Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human services 
on 
The President’s Fiscal Year 2019 Budget 
before 
Committee on Appropriations  
Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies  
 
U.S. Senate  
April 19, 2018 
 
The mission of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to enhance and protect 
the health and well-being of the American people.  
President Trump and all of us at HHS take that charge seriously. So, when programs are not as 
effective as they can be, or cost more than they ought to, or fail to deliver on their promise, 
change and reform are necessary.    
The President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget applies this reform mindset to the work of the 
Department, making thoughtful and strategic investments to protect the health and well-being of 
the American people, while addressing the opioid crisis, promoting patient-centered healthcare, 
strengthening services for American Indians and Alaska Natives, encouraging innovation in 
America’s healthcare future, addressing high drug prices, reforming the Department’s 
regulations, and generally focusing resources toward proven and effective initiatives. The Budget 
also recognizes the fiscal challenges our country faces today, and the need to focus our 
investments and update them to meet the needs of a rapidly changing world. 
The President’s Budget for HHS also reflects proposals to meet the President’s comprehensive 
Government-wide Reform Plan through a Department initiative called ReImagine HHS. 
ReImagine HHS, through a range of initiatives, aims to identify opportunities to improve the 
work HHS does for the American people, in terms of its efficiency, quality, and cost-
effectiveness.  In particular, ReImagine HHS offers a unique opportunity for the experienced 
career staff of the Department to lead initiatives that will advance the work of the Department 
and revamp outdated processes and structures. 
Across all of HHS’s priorities, the Budget makes clear that business-as-usual will not suffice, 
and that the substantial investments made every year at HHS ought to be allocated with 
efficiency and toward programs that work.  
Tackling the Opioid Epidemic 
One of the Department’s top priorities is fighting the scourge of opioid addiction facing our 
country. 
Due to skyrocketing numbers of opioid overdoses, deaths by drug overdose have become the 
leading cause of injury death in the United States.  In 2016, 174 Americans died each day from 
drug overdoses. American life expectancy has dropped for the second year in a row—a tragic 
development not seen in more than a half century. 
The President’s Budget recognizes the devastation caused by this crisis in communities across 
America, by providing a historic new investment of $10 billion in HHS funding to address the 
opioid crisis and serious mental illness, and building upon the work started under the 21st 
Century Cures Act.  
The Budget’s targeted investments advance the Department’s five part strategy, which 
complements work being done elsewhere in the Administration and covers:  
  Access: Improving access to prevention, treatment, and recovery services, including 
medication-assisted treatment;  
  Overdoses: Targeting availability and distribution of overdose-reversing drugs;  
  Data: Strengthening our understanding of the epidemic through better public health data 
and reporting;  
  Research: Supporting cutting edge research on pain and addiction; and  
  Pain: Advancing better practices for pain management.  
 
The Budget proposes to improve ways in which the Federal Government helps communities 
respond to the opioid epidemic.  As just one example, the Budget directs resources to the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to improve access to medication-
assisted treatment services, boost state capacity to establish and operate comprehensive 
prevention systems, and disseminate high-quality resources on best practices for treatment. 
 
The Budget includes a total of $126 million to support efforts by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) to prevent the abuse and overdose of opioids.  This investment supports 
key public health and surveillance activities at the state level, recognizing that states can best 
determine their unique needs.  CDC will also continue to increase the awareness and adoption of 
the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. In all of these activities, CDC will 
endeavor to support and execute programs that have a proven track record of success. 
 
We recognize that government at the Federal, state, and local levels cannot defeat the opioid 
crisis alone, so HHS will continue to leverage the resources and expertise of the private sector 
and academia to develop new tools to end the epidemic.  This includes a $500 million investment 
in a National Institutes of Health (NIH) public-private partnership to accelerate the development 
of new treatments for pain and addiction.  
 
To help address the drivers of the epidemic, current practices for pain management must also be 
rethought, including in the work of Federal agencies that prescribe painkillers.  The FY 2019 
Budget will support the Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force, which will 
determine whether there are gaps or inconsistencies in pain management best practices among 
Federal agencies; propose recommendations on addressing gaps or inconsistencies; provide the 
public with an opportunity to comment on any proposed recommendations; and develop a 
strategy for disseminating information about these best practices.  
 
Effectively Treating Serious Mental Illness 
Serious mental illness, such as a psychotic or major depressive disorder, afflicts nearly 10 
million American adults each year, and remains one of the nation’s most difficult healthcare 
challenges.  Without treatment, many of these individuals cycle repeatedly among the health, 
behavioral health, and criminal or juvenile justice systems, with each system insufficiently 
prepared to meet their needs.  According to one report, 10 times as many Americans with serious 
mental illness are in jail or prison than in inpatient psychiatric treatment, and tragically, 
Americans with serious mental illness live lives at least 10 years shorter, on average, than others.  
The Budget recognizes that there are effective, proven forms of treatment for those struggling 
with serious mental illness, which have not always received the necessary support.  One is 
“assertive community treatment,” which places individuals in the care of a multidisciplinary 
behavioral health staff to deliver comprehensive services and treatment and has been shown to 
reduce hospitalization and improve patient satisfaction compared with other interventions of the 
same cost.  The Budget fully funds a new Assertive Community Treatment for Individuals with 
Serious Mental Illness program, authorized by the 21st Century Cures Act.  
Another effective approach to serious mental illness is the Budget’s support of Certified 
Community Behavioral Clinics, funded as part of  the new $10 billion investment to address the 
opioid epidemic and serious mental illness.  The Budget also continues to direct 10 percent of 
state allocations from the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant to bring care more 
quickly to those experiencing a first episode of psychosis, a proven intervention.  
Advancing Health Reform That Works 
A Washington-centric, one-size-fits-all approach to healthcare —especially in insurance markets 
most affected by Obamacare — is simply not working and must change.  The President’s Budget 
proposes a bold plan to redirect a significant amount of healthcare funding back to the states and 
individuals, where healthcare decisions should be made, while also taking major steps to 
encourage innovation and better quality of care.  
The Budget supports repealing Obamacare and replacing the law with flexibility for states to 
create a free and open healthcare market tailored to their citizens’ needs.  The two-part approach 
is modeled closely after the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson amendment to H.R. 1628, the 
American Health Care Act of 2017, and also includes additional reforms to put healthcare 
spending on a sustainable fiscal path.  
The proposed Market-Based Health Care Grant Program will help states stabilize their insurance 
markets and provide for a smooth transition away from Obamacare.  The Budget would also fix 
the perverse incentive structures created by Obamacare, by ending the disparity between states 
that expanded Medicaid to new populations and those that did not and providing states with a 
choice between a per capita cap and a block grant.  
The Budget also proposes reforming our broken medical liability system, to ensure it is not 
driving excess costs.  Finally, the Budget proposes consolidating the byzantine system of 
graduate medical education funding into a single, direct grant program that will streamline 
incentives and better serve patients and providers.  
Bringing Down Drug Prices  
As President Trump has repeatedly made clear, the prices Americans pay for prescription drugs 
are simply too high.  The Budget proposes a range of legislative measures to build on the proven 
success of the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, including through giving drug plans 
more tools to negotiate with manufacturers and encourage use of higher value drugs..  In 
addition, the Budget discourages rebate and pricing strategies that increase spending for both 
beneficiaries and the Government and, for the first time in the program’s history, provides 
beneficiaries with more predictable annual drug expenses through the creation of a new out-of-
pocket spending cap for seniors with especially high drug costs. 
Sustainable Medicaid and Medicare Reforms  
Millions of Americans rely on Medicaid and Medicare to meet their everyday healthcare needs. 
Together, federal health care programs comprise the largest portion of the Federal budget.  The 
President’s Budget proposes several legislative solutions to improve the programs, promote 
greater efficiencies, advance patient-centered care, and reduce government-imposed burden on 
providers.  
The Administration recognizes that the over-50-year-old structure of the Medicaid program has 
failed to create a sustainable Federal-state partnership that is capable of controlling costs.  In 
fact, its outdated design incentivizes cost increases without delivering commensurate benefits or 
allowing for much-needed local health innovation. 
Our Budget proposes a new future for Medicaid that will restructure Medicaid financing, provide 
states with new flexibilities to better serve their communities, improve the state plan and waiver 
processes, and provide the right incentives to preserve the program for future generations. 
Boosting Upward Economic Mobility 
There is no more effective anti-poverty program than helping someone find a job.  Recognizing 
this common-sense approach, the President’s Budget re-focuses HHS’s public assistance 
programs on helping low-income Americans find gainful employment, providing them with a 
sense of purpose, personal dignity, and independence. 
Importantly, the Budget proposes key reforms to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 
program that reinforce its focus on promoting work as the best pathway to self-sufficiency. 
Specifically, the Budget strengthens the program’s accountability framework related to work 
requirements and ensures that states allocate sufficient funds to work, education, and training 
activities.  
The Budget also proposes establishing Welfare to Work Projects that will allow states to 
streamline funding from multiple public assistance programs and redesign service delivery to 
meet their constituents’ specific needs.  Importantly, these Welfare to Work Projects would be 
rigorously evaluated, expanding the evidence base that informs how assistance programs can be 
most effectively structured to help Americans achieve self-sufficiency. 
In January, for the first time in the history of the Medicaid program, the Federal Government 
indicated openness to state-led innovations that promote work or community engagement 
activities for working age, able-bodied enrollees.  Productive work and community engagement 
is associated with improved health and well-being, meaning this reform can achieve the goals of 
the Medicaid program while also supporting independence and economic self-sufficiency for 
millions of able-bodied adults. 
Promoting Efficiency and Innovation in Scientific Work 
Supporting and encouraging scientific research is a longstanding Federal priority, one that results 
in both a growing economy and longer lives.  Executing this responsibility demands that the 
Federal Government regularly consider how to organize such support in the most efficient 
manner possible. 
The administration believes it is a priority to support NIH, a crown jewel of American science, 
and proposes to do so not just through continued financial investments but also through 
innovative partnerships with non-federal entities, administrative reforms, and better coordination 
and planning.  
Among other efforts to derive maximum benefit from the substantial Federal investments made 
in NIH research, the Budget supports expanding public-private partnerships that will challenge 
private sector partners to match Federal investments; increasing coordination across NIH’s 
Institutes and Centers; focusing grant awards on projects with the highest potential to accrue 
benefits for public health; assessing new and current strategic investments in research; curtailing 
the rate at which high researcher salaries at private institutions are reimbursed with taxpayer 
dollars; and implementing burden reduction measures to reduce costs for grant recipients. 
The Budget also supports administrative reforms for NIH, including efforts to harmonize 
operational functions and break down silos within the agency.  In addition, the Budget proposes 
to consolidate three other major HHS research institutions inNIH to maximize the effectiveness 
of their research. 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is another crown jewel of American science.  But its 
needs and priorities must change as the face of medical innovation changes, too.  The Budget 
includes investments for FDA to speed the development and approval of new drugs and medical 
devices, and to increase the quality and safety of next generation manufacturing practices, 
including approximately $500 million to strengthen medical product safety development and 
access.  
Investing in Our Biodefense, Preparedness, and Global Health Security Programs 
The President’s Budget aims to improve our nation’s preparedness for, and capabilities to 
respond to, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats; pandemic influenza; natural 
disasters; emerging infectious diseases; and cybersecurity challenges.  
In each area, smart investments that empower the private sector and our global partners will help 
keep our country safe. 
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Threat Preparedness 
The Budget includes $512 million for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development 
Authority (BARDA) and $510 million for Project BioShield, which fund successful public-
private partnerships that support the development and procurement of new medical products 
crucial to defending our country against chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and 
infectious disease threats.  Prior HHS investments in these programs have resulted in more than 
190 medical countermeasure candidates, 34 FDA-approved products from BARDA, and the 
procurement of 14 new products for the Strategic National Stockpile. Funding will also be 
available for exercises to build preparedness for threats such as emerging infectious diseases, 
natural disasters, and manmade biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiation threats 
The Budget proposes to transfer the Strategic National Stockpile to the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary for Preparedness and Response, to boost operational efficiencies and streamline 
development and procurement of medical countermeasures.  It also provides $575 million to 
maintain and replenish the stockpile, the nation’s largest supply of life-saving medical 
countermeasures that can be deployed in the event of a public health emergency. . 
Natural Disaster Preparedness 
Following the powerful hurricanes and historic wildfires of 2017, HHS remains ready to respond 
to any and all hazards when disaster strikes. The Budget ensures the Department is able to 
support essential emergency preparedness activities to refine our disaster responses.  In 
particular, Hospital Preparedness Program resources will continue to be allocated to states and 
localities according to risk, ensuring communities with more risk have the necessary 
coordination and resources.  The Budget also continues to provide $50 million to support the 
National Disaster Medical System.  Through this cost-effective and successful program, HHS 
trains and deploys teams of American healthcare professionals from across the country to 
provide medical care to our fellow Americans in the event of an emergency. 
Global Health Security  
One of the most effective ways to protect Americans from the threat of infectious diseases is to 
enable other countries to follow through on their own commitments to contain and respond to 
disease threats.  Such investments are far less expensive than mounting an international public 
health response to control an epidemic.  
To support this goal, the Budget provides a total of $409 million for CDC’s global health 
activities, which strengthens CDC’s international preparedness and response capabilities.  The 
Budget would also build on substantial progress that has been made toward global health security 
goals under the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), including a $59 million investment that 
provides funding for CDC to continue this work into FY 2020. 
Cybersecurity  
The Budget recognizes that HHS must continue robust operations to meet today’s cybersecurity 
needs and includes $68 million to ensure the Department is able to protect sensitive and critical 
information in an ever-changing threat landscape.  The Department will also focus on support for 
and coordination with the healthcare and public health sectors in close coordination with the 
Department of Homeland Security, to promote information and resource sharing across levels of 
government and the private sector.  
Strengthening the Indian Health Service 
Through the Indian Health Service (IHS), HHS is responsible for providing quality healthcare 
services to more than 2.2 million eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives.  The Budget 
prioritizes funding for this agency, and in particular for direct health services.  The Budget also 
makes significant investments to assist IHS facilities with meeting CMS quality health standards.  
Looking forward, and consistent with our statutory authorities, we recognize that how we 
provide quality healthcare in Indian Country and beyond must change to achieve and ensure the 
high quality of these services.  More Tribes have assumed the responsibilities of providing 
healthcare for their members with support from the IHS, and investments in the Budget reflect 
our support for the growth of tribal self-governance in the provision of healthcare.  
* * * * * 
The President’s 2019 Budget for HHS recognizes the importance of focusing government 
spending on programs that work and reforming our nation’s healthcare programs for a fast-
changing world.   This Budget recognizes that securing America’s future demands sound fiscal 
management and responsible decisions about our priorities.  If we are serious about fulfilling 
HHS’s mission of enhancing and protecting the well-being of all Americans, we must adopt the 
bold innovation and direction espoused by the President’s Budget.

STATEMENT OF RYAN ZINKE, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR 
BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES 
 SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
ON THE 2019 PRESIDENT’S BUDGET REQUEST 
MAY 10, 2018 
 
 
Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Udall, and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to 
appear before you today to discuss the 2019 President’s Budget for the Department of the 
Interior.  The 2019 Budget Request for Interior is $11.7 billion.   
2019 BUDGET PRIORITIES 
Interior’s 2019 budget prioritizes American interests with targeted investments to advance 
American energy dominance, enhance public access to public lands, and strengthen the economy 
through infrastructure investment, regulatory relief, and fiscal responsibility.  The Department’s 
2019 budget reflects the Administration’s commitment to strike the right balance of development 
and conservation of America’s resources to advance important national objectives. 
A major component of the 2019 budget is the Public Lands Infrastructure legislative proposal, 
which will provide up to $18 billion to address Interior’s deferred maintenance backlog in the 
national parks, national wildlife refuges, and Bureau of Indian Education-funded schools.  The 
investment in the Interior’s infrastructure will be funded by federal revenues derived from rents, 
rights of ways for energy purposes, and royalties collected by the Department of the Interior.  
The proposal complements the President’s national infrastructure investment initiative and 
recognizes the strategic importance of long-term investment in America’s treasures. 
GENERATING REVENUE AND UTILIZING NATURAL RESOURCES 
Growing America’s Economy 
Across Interior’s diverse mission, the 2019 budget emphasizes the Department’s crucial role in 
promoting economic growth for America.  America’s lands hold tremendous job-creating assets.  
Interior supports $254 billion in estimated economic benefit, while direct grants and payments to 
States, Tribes, and local communities provide an estimated $10 billion in economic benefit.  In 
2017, the Department collected $9.6 billion from energy, mineral, grazing, and forestry activities 
on behalf of the American people.  Interior also supports the economy by eliminating 
unnecessary and burdensome Federal regulatory requirements.  For example, in 2017, Interior 
initiated 21 deregulatory actions all with significant associated savings for the taxpayer, once 
enacted. 
The 2019 budget maintains support for Interior programs that play a critical role in encouraging 
national infrastructure development.  The 2019 budget includes $98.8 million for the Fish and 
Wildlife Service’s planning and consultation activities to support development while avoiding 
species conflicts.  This request enables FWS to meet legal consultation requirements and avoid 
logjams that could delay infrastructure projects and associated economic benefits to 
communities, States, Tribes, and companies.  The request includes $118.7 million for the Bureau 
Page 1 of 11 
 
of Reclamation’s construction of water delivery systems for Tribes and local communities.  In 
addition, Reclamation continues to explore future water storage opportunities.  The budget also 
includes $48.3 million for the Bureau of Land Management’s cadastral program, which maps 
and surveys the lands and resources needed to permit rights-of-way and other infrastructure 
project requirements in a timely fashion.   
Advancing Energy Dominance 
Interior plays a significant role in the Administration’s objective to achieve America’s energy 
dominance.  The budget proposes $792.0 million in current and permanent funding for energy 
related programs across the Department.  Interior’s 2019 budget continues to support an “all-of-
the-above” energy development strategy, increasing funding for onshore and offshore oil and 
gas, expanding coal activities, and sustaining the current pace of renewable energy development. 
A large portion of Interior’s energy development activities occur on the Outer Continental Shelf.  
The 2019 request includes support from offsetting collections for a total offshore energy 
development and safety program of $379.2 million.  The budget includes a total of $179.3 
million for offshore oil, gas, and renewable energy development activities managed by the 
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.  It includes $9.4 million for BOEM to prepare the 2019-
2024 National OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program.  The request for BOEM also includes $28.1 
million for Renewable Energy activities across the Bureau.  The 2019 budget includes $199.9 
million for the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement’s programs to streamline the 
permitting process, conduct inspections, evaluate emerging offshore technologies, improve 
safety, conduct training, and maintain up-to-date policies, standards, and guidelines.   
Onshore, the budget includes $176.3 million in current and permanent funding for the BLM oil 
and gas management program which generated $348.9 million from bonus bids derived from 
onshore oil and gas lease sales in 2017.  The 2019 budget includes $137.2 million in 
appropriated funds for BLM oil and gas management and oversight, including leasing, 
permitting, and inspections.  This funding will be used to expand areas available for leasing, 
expedite permitting, and improve various aspects of program management.  The budget includes 
$19.5 million for the BLM coal management program to help reduce processing times, simplify 
the lease application process, and improve the timeliness to complete lease sale fair market value 
determinations.  The budget includes $16.0 million for BLM to support onshore Renewable 
Energy development.  
An important component of Interior’s natural resource programs is the collection and 
disbursement of receipts from development.  The 2019 budget includes $137.5 million for the 
Office of Natural Resources Revenue.  In 2017, Interior held the first meeting of the re-
established Royalty Policy Committee, which includes 20 members representing local, tribal, and 
State governments and other stakeholders.  The RPC advises the Secretary on the fair market 
value and revenue collection from Federal and Indian mineral and energy leases, including from 
renewable energy sources.

Increasing Natural Resource Development 
Interior manages a wealth of additional natural resource assets that require balanced stewardship 
and management.  Maintaining healthy and productive forests requires active management.  The 
2019 budget includes $9.5 million for BLM’s Public Domain Forestry program and $90.0 
million for the Oregon and California grant lands.  Both programs support jobs and local 
economies through timber and timber product sales.  The programs also maintain and improve 
the productivity and resilience of forest and woodland ecosystems through sales and forest 
development projects such as density management and reforestation.   
The BLM actively manages rangeland and grazing activities on public lands in the West which 
remain a vital part of local western economies.  The 2019 budget includes $82.1 million for the 
Rangeland Management program.  The BLM manages nearly 18,000 livestock grazing permits 
and leases on the public lands. 
Another example is the U.S. Geological Survey Mineral Resources program which conducts 
assessments to identify critical minerals and estimate potential supplies.  A recent Secretarial 
Order directs all Interior bureaus to identify a list of critical minerals, identify domestic sources, 
and streamline permitting to encourage domestic production of these critical minerals.  The 2019 
budget for USGS includes $19.1 million to support this Administration priority.  With this 
funding, USGS will accelerate nationwide geological, geophysical, and topographical surveys of 
the United States to locate domestic critical mineral sources. 
CONSERVING OUR LAND AND WATER AND EXPANDING OUTDOOR ACCESS 
Interior is the steward of America’s public lands and cultural resources for the benefit of current 
and future generations.  Taking care of the resources we have rather than acquiring new Federal 
lands continues to be a top priority in the 2019 budget.  To administer ongoing projects, the 
budget for land acquisition programs across the Department is $8.1 million.   
The 2019 budget includes $4.6 billion for operating programs in the three primary land 
management bureaus—BLM, FWS, and the National Park Service. This funding supports the 
day-to-day management of the natural resources and public amenities of America’s national 
parks, national wildlife refuges, and BLM-managed public areas, including its national 
conservation lands.  Within this request is funding to support visitor services and safety, law 
enforcement, and maintenance of facilities.  Early eradication and control of invasive species is 
an example of a core stewardship activity shared Department-wide, which is funded through land 
management operations.  Across Interior, the 2019 budget includes a total of $103.1 million for 
invasive species activities to address significant issues such as the spread of invasive mussels and 
Asian Carp. 
The Land and Water Conservation Fund matching grants provided to States, and through States 
to local governments, support the acquisition and development of public outdoor recreation areas 
and facilities all across the Nation.  The 2019 budget continues a funding shift that began in 2018 
for NPS State Assistance grants from discretionary to mandatory funding.  Starting in 2009, 
discretionary LWCF appropriations for the State Assistance program were supplemented by 
revenues from certain oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico, as authorized by Section 105 of 
Page 3 of 11 
 
the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act.  Under existing law, this permanent funding for NPS 
State Assistance grants is expected to reach $89.3 million in 2019.   
Ensuring the availability of water is central to the Department’s resource stewardship mission 
and is vitally important to communities across the West.  The 2019 budget includes $1.0 billion 
for Reclamation’s water resource programs to ensure millions of customers continue to receive 
the water and power essential for daily life, healthy local economies, and land management.  The 
2019 budget includes funding to continue the WaterSMART water conservation grants and funds 
Title XVI water recycling reuse research grants to support local innovation efforts to stretch 
water supplies.   
The 2019 budget maintains an important commitment to Interior’s neighboring communities, by 
including $465.0 million in the discretionary request for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program.  
The PILT payments offset the loss in property tax revenue for communities with significant 
Federal lands in their jurisdictions.   
FULFILLING OUR TRUST AND INSULAR RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Department of the Interior upholds the Federal government’s unique trust responsibilities by 
fostering government-to-government relationships between the Federal government and federally 
recognized Tribes, American Indians, and Alaska Natives.  The U.S. also has important 
relationships with the affiliated insular areas including the territories of American Samoa, Guam, 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.  Interior 
administers and oversees Federal assistance to the three Freely Associated States: the Federated 
States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau. 
The 2019 budget addresses Federal responsibilities and tribal needs related to education, social 
services, infrastructure, and stewardship of land, water, and other natural resources.  The budget 
prioritizes support for programs that serve the broadest service population rather than initiatives 
that are more narrowly focused.  The President’s budget maintains the Administration’s strong 
support for the principle of tribal self-determination and efforts to strengthen tribal communities 
across Indian Country.  The budget calls for full funding for Contract Support Costs and Tribal 
Grant Support Costs that Tribes incur from managing Federal Indian programs.  
The Bureau of Indian Affairs also undertakes initiatives to promote resilient tribal communities.  
The 2019 budget includes $2.5 million to address the opioid crisis, which has been particularly 
devastating in Indian Country.  The funding will support BIA participation in intra- and 
interagency initiatives that support opioid and substance abuse prevention efforts.  The BIA 
liaisons will align, leverage, and coordinate Federal efforts and resources to assist American 
Indian and Alaska Native communities in achieving their goals to reduce the supply of drugs, 
provide opioid addiction prevention assistance, and otherwise combat the opioid crisis, which is 
an Administration priority. 
The 2019 budget includes $173.0 million across the Department to honor Indian land and water 
Settlement commitments.  This includes $127.3 million in Reclamation and $45.6 million in 
BIA.  The budget continues to meet Federal responsibilities outlined in enacted land and water 
Page 4 of 11 
 
rights claim settlements with Indian Tribes to ensure they have access to land and water to meet 
domestic, economic, and cultural needs.   
In 2019, the Office of Insular Affairs will continue to execute activities which bolster healthcare 
capacity, strengthen island economies, and fulfill U.S. compact obligations.  The proposed 2019 
OIA budget is $608.0 million, with $84.1 million in current appropriations.   
PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE AND THE BORDER 
A key component of Interior’s land stewardship and public safety goals is management of 
wildland fire.  The 2019 budget provides $388.1 million for wildfire suppression.  The budget 
responsibly funds 100 percent of the rolling 10-year average cost for wildfire suppression in the 
Departments of Agriculture and the Interior within discretionary budget caps, and proposes a 
separate annual cap adjustment for wildfire suppression operations to ensure adequate resource 
availability during severe fire seasons. 
Over 12.5 million acres under Interior’s jurisdiction are within 50 miles of the United States-
Mexico border.  More than 40 percent of the border, or 820 linear miles, is managed by Interior’s 
land management agencies and the U.S. Forest Service.  Interior is engaged with the Department 
of Homeland Security to increase security on the Southwest border, including 74 border miles on 
tribal lands primarily made up of lands located on and managed by the Tohono O’odham Nation 
in Arizona.  The budget includes $1.8 million to continue implementation of the Department’s 
Southwest Border Radio Demonstration Project, which is an example of the coordination which 
occurs to help protect our border.  The project was developed in cooperation with BLM, FWS, 
NPS, and the U.S. Forest Service in the Southwest border region to support the land mobile radio 
program and infrastructure, and ensure continuity of communications essential for safety, law 
enforcement, and resource management in the area. 
Interior also plays an important role in preparation for and addressing the aftermath of natural 
hazard events.  The 2019 budget includes $117.3 million for the USGS Natural Hazards 
programs to maintain important nationwide monitoring networks, including volcano and 
earthquake networks, which provide vital scientific information to emergency managers.   
MODERNIZING OUR ORGANIZATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE NEXT 100 YEARS 
Infrastructure Management 
Interior manages an infrastructure asset portfolio with a replacement value exceeding $300 
billion, ranging from elementary and secondary schools serving Indian children in the West, to 
highways and bridges serving the daily commuting needs of the Washington, D.C., metropolitan 
area.  Many of these assets are deteriorating, with older assets becoming more expensive to 
repair and maintain in good condition.  Taking care of this significant asset portfolio is a 
persistent challenge.   
 
Interior’s deferred maintenance backlog has grown to over $16 billion in 2017 of which over $11 
billion belongs to NPS.  In addition to funding proposed in the Administration’s Public Lands 
Page 5 of 11 
 
Infrastructure Fund, the 2019 budget for NPS includes $281.5 million in current funding for 
construction and deferred maintenance projects. Construction and maintenance funding across 
the Department totals over $1.4 billion in 2019, excluding Reclamation.  
Management and Reforms 
During the peak summer seasons, the Department of the Interior has nearly 70,000 employees in 
2,400 locations across the United States, Puerto Rico, U.S. Territories, and Freely Associated 
States.  Interior is also taking bold steps to better position itself for the next 100 years.  In 
response to the President’s Executive Order on a Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the 
Executive Branch, Interior is working to reorganize its operating structure to establish unified 
regional boundaries to provide better coordination across the Department to improve mission 
delivery and focus resources in the field.  The 2019 budget includes a total of $17.5 million for 
this effort.  The budget also proposes additional shifts to better align functions within the 
Department and respond to Congressional direction related to the Office of the Special Trustee 
for American Indians.  The Department is continuing to evaluate the advantages and 
disadvantages of BOEM and BSEE being separate organizations with the understanding that 
revenue collection activities need to be separate from safety. 
The Department annually spends nearly $3 billion to procure goods and services, over $1 billion 
on information technology, and over $300 million to administer acquisition and human resources 
services.  In 2019, Interior will work to achieve cost savings of $52.7 million across the 
Department, through more aggressive use of shared services and use of multiagency “Best in 
Class” procurement vehicles, such as shared contracting with other bureaus and Federal 
agencies.

availability, and environmental compliance that affects water delivery and hydropower 
generation.  The budget also includes $7.6 million for Reclamation to proactively stop the spread 
of invasive mussels in the West, including preventing the spread of zebra and quagga mussels 
into the Columbia River Basin. 
U.S. Geological Survey – The 2019 budget request for the USGS is $859.7 million.  The budget 
includes $72.9 million for satellite operations, which includes $31.9 million to continue 
development of the Landsat 9 ground system component for launch in 2021. 
The request emphasizes science to inform energy and mineral development with $84.1 million 
for the Energy and Minerals Mission Area, including $19.1 million to locate domestic critical 
mineral sources.  These commodities are those minerals with important uses particularly in 
technology, and no viable substitutes, yet face potential disruption in supply.  This funding will 
support the Administration’s initiative to spur critical mineral resource development in the 
United States.   
The budget for Natural Hazards is $117.3 million to support essential hazards monitoring, and 
provide scientific information needed by resource managers and policy makers.  The budget 
maintains support for nationwide networks of more than 8,200 streamgages and nearly 3,000 
earthquake sensors.  The 2019 budget includes $96.1 million for Ecosystems programs, focusing 
on nationally significant priorities, including detecting and responding to invasive species and 
wildlife disease, research supporting the conservation and recovery of species at-risk or protected 
by law, and science supporting biological resource management.  The budget provides for 
continued collection of high-resolution elevation and hydrography data for the Nation, including 
modernizing maps for Alaska and complete national lidar coverage by 2033.   
Fish and Wildlife Service – The 2019 President’s budget requests $1.2 billion for FWS 
programs of which $1.1 billion supports FWS operations.  The budget prioritizes funding to 
maintain operations and maintenance for the National Wildlife Refuge System at $473.1 million 
and includes $50.0 million for the National Fish Hatchery System.     
Ecological Services programs are funded at $211.8 million and the budget prioritizes funding for 
Planning and Consultation and species Recovery activities.  The budget is $74.8 million for FWS 
conservation grants including $31.3 million for State and Tribal Wildlife Grants, $33.6 million 
for the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund, $6.0 million for the Multinational Species 
Conservation Fund, and $3.9 million for Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation.  The budget 
proposes $7.0 million for FWS land acquisition activities, which includes $12.0 million in new 
budget authority and a $5.0 million proposed cancellation of prior year balances. 
National Park Service – The 2019 budget request for NPS is $2.7 billion which includes $299.0 
million provided in the Budget Policy Addendum for 2019.   
The budget proposes $2.4 billion for NPS operations.  Within this account funding is prioritized 
for the care and maintenance of existing resources, including repair and rehabilitation projects, 
which addresses the deferred maintenance backlog, and cyclic maintenance projects, which 
ensure maintenance is conducted in a timely fashion to avoid increasing the deferred 
Page 8 of 11 
 
maintenance backlog.  The budget proposes $241.3 million for the Construction account, which 
includes $157.0 million for line-item construction activities.   
The request provides $32.2 million for National Recreation and Preservation programs to support 
local community efforts to preserve natural and cultural resources.  The 2019 budget includes 
$32.7 million for the Historic Preservation Fund core grants-in-aid programs.  The budget 
assumes funding for Land and Water Conservation Fund State Assistance Grants shift from 
discretionary to mandatory funding from offshore oil and gas receipts, estimated to support an 
$89.3 million program.  The budget requests $8.8 million to administer both ongoing Federal 
land acquisition projects and American Battlefield Protection grants, and includes a $10.0 
million cancellation in available prior year balances, for a net total of -$1.2 million for Land 
Acquisition and State Assistance.  
Indian Affairs – The 2019 budget request for Indian Affairs is $2.4 billion.  Funding for 
Operation of Indian Programs totals $2.0 billion.  In 2019, priority is given to programs serving 
the broadest audience rather than initiatives or pilots.  Within this total is $741.9 million for 
Bureau of Indian Education programs where funding focuses on direct school operations and full 
funding for Tribal Grant Support Costs.  The main operating account also includes $350.1 
million for Public Safety and Justice programs including $2.5 million to address the opioid crisis 
which has been particularly devastating in Indian Country.  The budget includes $258.9 million 
for Trust Services programs to fulfill key fiduciary trust responsibilities. 
The budget fully funds Contract Support Costs at $231.0 million, which will cover all anticipated 
tribal program administration requirements at the requested program funding level.  The budget 
requests $133.3 million for Construction programs and prioritizes dams, irrigation projects, and 
irrigation systems which deliver water to aid economic development as well as protect lives, 
resources, and property.  The budget prioritizes funding within education construction for 
improvement and repair of existing facilities.  The budget also includes $45.6 million to provide 
payments to ongoing Indian Land and Water settlements and $6.7 million for the Indian 
Guaranteed Loan Program. 
Departmental Offices  
Office of the Secretary – The 2019 budget request for Departmental Operations is $134.7 million.  
The budget reflects the proposed transfer of $140.5 million associated with the Office of Natural 
Resources Revenue to a new appropriation within Department-wide Programs.

among bureaus and offices as they fulfill their duties.  
Office of Inspector General – The 2019 budget proposes $52.5 million for the Office of Inspector 
General to continue support for audit and investigations across the Department.  The budget 
Page 9 of 11 
 
supports the need for case management system maintenance, OPM security clearances, 
continuous data monitoring, and information technology systems assistance. 
Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians – The 2018 budget requests $107.1 million 
for OST.  The budget proposes several organizational changes including to realign OST under 
the Assistant Secretary – Indian Affairs; to shift the Land Buy Back Program for Tribal Nations 
to OST; and proposes OST assume coordination of certain functions of the Office of Navajo and 
Hopi Indian Relocation. 
Department-wide Programs  
Payments in Lieu of Taxes – The 2019 budget proposes $465.0 million in discretionary funding 
for PILT.  This amount includes $68.1 million provided in the Budget Policy Addendum for 
2019. 
Office of Natural Resources Revenue – The 2019 budget request includes $137.5 million for 
ONRR’s receipts management programs as a separate appropriation to increase transparency of 
the program.  The request includes $3.7 million for anticipated contract cost increases to 
maintain the Minerals Revenue Management Support System.  
Central Hazardous Materials Fund – The 2019 budget requests $2.0 million for the Central 
Hazardous Materials Fund to support program management and legal staff.  The program will 
fund highest priority remediation projects based on the availability of recoveries and focus 
resources on remediation projects with potentially responsible parties.  
Wildland Fire Management – The 2019 budget request for the Wildland Fire Management 
Program is $870.4 million.  The request provides $388.1 million for Suppression Operations to 
fully fund the 10-year average.  Separately the Administration proposes an annual cap 
adjustment for wildfire suppression operations during severe fire seasons.  The budget includes 
$322.2 million for wildland fire Preparedness activities to support Interior’s firefighting 
capabilities.  To maintain proper stewardship of public lands and address wildfire risk, the 
budget includes $150.6 million for Fuels Management activities.  The budget includes $9.5 
million to support high priority restoration of public lands damaged by wildfire. 
Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration – The 2019 request for NRDAR 
is $4.6 million.  The budget includes funding needed for ongoing damage assessments and 
restoration activities. 
Working Capital Fund – The 2019 budget proposes $56.7 million for the appropriated portion of 
the Department’s Working Capital Fund.  The request includes $46.8 million for the Financial 
and Business Management System and $9.9 million for Department-wide Cybersecurity needs. 
Legislative Proposals 
Public Lands Infrastructure Fund – The 2019 budget launches the Administration’s Public 
Lands Infrastructure Fund (PLIF) to address repairs and improvements in national parks, national 
wildlife refuges, and BIE-funded schools.  The PLIF would dedicate 50 percent of the 
Department’s incoming, unallocated energy leasing revenues that exceed the 2018 budget 
Page 10 of 11 
 
baseline estimates, for the NPS, FWS and BIE infrastructure needs.  These revenues will be 
deposited into the Fund and will be capped at a total of $18.0 billion. 
Bureau of Reclamation Title Transfer – The Administration has a proposal to better facilitate title 
transfer of Reclamation facilities to non-Federal entities when such transfers are beneficial.  This 
proposal will allow local water managers to make their own decisions to improve water 
management at the local level, while allowing Reclamation to focus management efforts on 
projects with a greater Federal nexus. 
Cancel Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act Account Balances – The budget proposes 
legislation to cancel $230.0 million in unobligated balances from the Southern Nevada Public 
Land Management Act program over three years.  This would redirect a portion of program 
balances to the Treasury for broader taxpayer use.  The SNPLMA program is not proposed for 
elimination and viable conservation efforts will continue to be supported. 
Land and Water Conservation Fund – The LWCF receipts authorization expires at the end of 
fiscal year 2018 and the Administration will review options for reauthorization. 
Recreation Fee Program – The budget proposes to permanently reauthorize the Federal Lands 
Recreation Enhancement Act, set to expire in September 2019.  As a precaution, appropriations 
language is also submitted proposing a two-year extension through September 2021.  The 
revenues collected by Interior from these recreation fees – nearly $318.8 million in 2017 – are an 
important source of funding for land management operations, maintenance, and improvements to 
recreation facilities on public lands. 
Termination of EPAct Geothermal Payments to Counties – The budget proposes to restore 
Federal geothermal leasing revenue allocations to the historical formula of 50 percent to the 
States and 50 percent to the U.S. Treasury by repealing Section 224(b) of the Energy Policy Act 
of 2005.  
Wildland Fire Suppression Disaster Cap Adjustment – The budget responsibly funds 100 percent 
of the rolling 10-year average cost of wildfire suppression in the Departments of Agriculture and 
the Interior within discretionary budget caps, and proposes a separate annual cap adjustment for 
wildfire suppression operations in severe fire seasons, similar to how unanticipated funding 
needs for other natural disasters are addressed.   
Conclusion 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the President’s 2019 Budget Request for the 
Department of the Interior.  This budget maintains core functions important to the American 
people and supports transformation the Department needs to accomplish more effective 
management over the next 100 years.  It reflects tough choices to prioritize and focus limited 
resources where investments have the most impact while continuing to deliver access and 
services that are critical to Americans.  Achieving success in all of Interior’s important 
responsibilities for the American people is the Department’s primary focus and Interior is 
committed to take action to better accomplish our mission.  Thank you again for your continued 
support of the Department’s mission.  This concludes my written statement and I look forward to 
your questions on this budget.

STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE RANDY REEVES 
UNDER SECRETARY FOR MEMORIAL AFFAIRS 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 
 
FOR PRESENTATION BEFORE THE 
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE  
SUBCOMMITTEE ON MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, VETERANS AFFAIRS, AND 
RELATED AGENCIES 
 
BUDGET REQUEST FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 
 
May 9, 2018 
Good afternoon Chairman Boozman, Ranking Member Schatz, and distinguished 
members of the Subcommittee.  Thank you for the opportunity to testify today in support 
of the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget, including the FY 2020 Advance 
Appropriation (AA) request.  I am accompanied today by:  Jon Rychalski, Assistant 
Secretary for Management and Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Carolyn Clancy, Executive-
in-Charge of the Veterans Health Administration; and Thomas Murphy, Executive-in-
Charge of the Veterans Benefits Administration.  I also want to thank Congress for 
making 2017 a legislative success for Veterans.  With the unwavering support and 
leadership of our VA committees, Congress supported and passed groundbreaking 
legislation on Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) accountability, appeals reform, the 
Forever GI Bill, Veterans Choice improvements, personnel improvements, and 
extended Choice funding twice.  The 2019 budget request fulfills the President’s strong 
commitment to all of our Nation’s Veterans by providing the resources necessary to 
improve the care and support our Veterans have earned through sacrifice and service to 
our country.   
FY 2019 Budget Request 
The President’s FY 2019 Budget requests $198.6 billion for VA—$88.9 billion in 
discretionary funding (including medical care collections), of which $76.5 billion is 
requested as the FY 2019 AA for Medical Care including collections.  The $76.5 billion 
is comprised of $74.1 billion previously requested (including collections), and an annual 
appropriation adjustment of $500 million for Medical Services for community care and 
$1.9 billion for the Veterans Choice Fund.  This budget will sustain the progress we 
have made and provide additional resources to improve patient access and timeliness 
of medical care services for the approximately 9 million enrolled Veterans eligible for VA 
health care, while improving benefits delivery for our Veterans and their beneficiaries.  
The President’s FY 2019 budget also requests $109.7 billion in mandatory funding, of 
which $107.7 billion was previously requested, for programs such as disability 
compensation and pensions.    
For the FY 2020 AA, the budget requests $79.1 billion in discretionary funding 
including collections for Medical Care and $121.3 billion in mandatory advance 
appropriations for Compensation and Pensions, Readjustment Benefits, and Veterans 
1 
 
Insurance and Indemnities benefits programs in the Veterans Benefits Administration 
(VBA).  
This is a strong budget request that fulfills the President’s commitment to 
Veterans by ensuring the Nation’s Veterans receive high-quality health care and timely 
access to benefits and services while concurrently improving efficiency and fiscal 
responsibility.  I urge Congress to support and fully fund our FY 2019 and FY 2020 AA 
budget requests—these resources are critical to enabling the Department to meet the 
increasing needs of our Veterans.  
Through the FY 2019 budget formulation process, we have critically assessed 
and prioritized our needs and aggressively pursued internal offsets, modernization 
reforms, and other efficiencies to provide Veterans the quality care they have earned 
while serving as a responsible fiscal steward.  VA greatly appreciates Congress’ 
ongoing support for VA, as demonstrated by consistent support for our legislative 
priorities and consistently generous enacted appropriations, including the recently 
enacted 2018 Omnibus.  On behalf of the entire VA and the many Veterans we serve, 
we thank you for your unflagging commitment to our mission and in particular your 
support for our capital infrastructure needs.  VA takes very seriously our obligation to 
you, the American taxpayer, and the Veterans who served our country so well.   
Veterans’ Medical Care 
   
The FY 2019 Budget includes $ 76.5 billion for Medical Care and $79.1 billion for 
the FY 2020 AA.  VA is committed to ensuring Veterans get high quality, timely, and 
convenient access to care that is affordable for future generations.  As a result, VA is 
implementing reforms that will prioritize our foundational services while redirecting to the 
community those services that they can do more effectively and efficiently.  These 
foundational services are those that are most related to service-connected disabilities 
and unique to the skills and mission of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).   
 
Foundational Services include these mission-driven services, such as: 
• Primary Care, including Women’s Health; 
• Urgent Care; 
• Mental Health Care; 
• Geriatrics and Extended Care; 
• Rehabilitation (e.g., spinal cord, brain injury/polytrauma, prosthesis/orthoses, 
blind rehab); 
• Post Deployment Health Care; and 
• War-Related Illness and Injury Study Centers functions. 
 
VA facility and Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) leaders are being 
asked to assess additional community options for other health services that are important 
to Veterans, yet may be as effectively or more conveniently delivered by community 
providers.  Local VA leaders have been advised to consider accessibility of VA facilities 
and convenience factors (like weekend hours) as they develop recommendations for 
access to community providers for Veterans in their service areas.   
2 
 
 
While the focus on Foundational Services will be a significant change to the way 
VA provides health care, VA will continue to ensure that the full array of statutory VA 
health care services are made available to all enrolled Veterans.  VA will also continue 
to offer services that are essential components of Veteran care and assistance, such 
as assistance for homeless Veterans, Veterans Resource Centers, the Veterans Crisis 
Line/Suicide Prevention, Mental Health Intensive Case Management, treatment for 
Military Sexual Trauma, and substance abuse programs. 
In order to provide Veterans and taxpayers the greatest value for each dollar, the 
Budget also proposes certain changes to the way in which we spend those resources.  
For example, our FY 2019 request proposes to merge the Medical Community Care 
appropriation with the Medical Services appropriation, as was the practice prior to FY 
2017.  The separate appropriation for Community Care has restricted our Medical 
Center Directors as they manage their budgets and make decisions about whether the 
care can be provided in their facility or must be purchased from community providers.  
This is a dynamic situation, as our staff must adjust to hiring and departures, 
emergencies such as the recent hurricanes, and other unanticipated changes in the 
health care environment throughout the year.  This change will maximize our ability to 
focus even more resources on the services Veterans most need. 
 
VA is committed to delivering timely and high-quality health care to our Nation’s 
Veterans.  Veterans now have access to same-day services for primary care and 
mental health care at the more than 1,000 VA clinics across our system.   
 
In FY 2019, VA will expand Veteran access to medical care by increasing 
medical and clinical staff, improving its facilities, and expanding care provided in the 
community.  The FY 2019 Budget requests a total of $76.5 billion in funding for 
Veterans’ medical care in discretionary budget authority, including collections.  The 
FY 2019 request will support nearly 315,688 medical care Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) 
employees.   
 
VA is implementing a VISN-level Gap Coverage plan that will enable facilities to 
request gap coverage providers in areas that are struggling with staffing shortages.  It is 
a seamless electronic request that allows VISNs to focus resources where they are 
most needed according to supply and demand.  Telehealth will be the principal form of 
coverage in this initiative, which is budget neutral.   
Suicide prevention is VA’s highest clinical priority, and Veteran suicide is a 
national health crisis.  On average, 20 Veterans die by suicide every day—this is 
unacceptable.  The integration of Mental Health program offices and their alignment 
with the suicide prevention team and the Veterans Crisis Line is being implemented to 
further enhance VA’s ability to effectively meet the needs of the most vulnerable 
Veterans.  The FY 2019 Budget Request increases resources to standardize suicide 
screening and risk assessments and expands options for safe and effective treatment 
for Veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide.   
3 
 
The FY 2019 Budget requests $8.6 billion for Veterans’ mental health services.  It 
also includes $190 million for suicide prevention outreach.  VA recognizes that Veterans 
are at an increased risk for suicide, and we have implemented a national suicide 
prevention strategy to address this crisis.  VA is bringing the best minds in the public 
and private sectors together to determine the next steps in implementing the Ending 
Veteran Suicide Initiative.  VA’s suicide prevention program is based on a public health 
approach that is ongoing, utilizing universal, selective, indicated strategies while 
recognizing that suicide prevention requires ready access to high-quality mental health 
services, supplemented by programs that address the risk for suicide directly, starting 
far earlier in the trajectory that leads to a Veteran taking his or her own life.  VA cannot 
do this alone; 70 percent of Veterans who die by suicide are not actively engaged in VA 
health care.  Veteran suicide is a national issue and can only be ended through a 
nationwide community-level approach that begins to solve the upstream risks Veterans 
face, such as loss of belonging, meaningful employment, and engagement with family, 
friends, and community.   
 
Executive Order to Improve Mental Health Resources 
 
On January 9, 2018, President Trump signed an Executive Order (13822) titled, 
“Supporting Our Veterans During Their Transition From Uniformed Service to Civilian 
Life.”  This Executive Order directs the Department of Defense (DoD), VA, and the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop a Joint Action Plan that describes 
concrete actions to provide access to mental health treatment and suicide prevention 
resources for transitioning uniformed Servicemembers in the year following their 
discharge, separation, or retirement.   
 
VA, along with DoD and DHS, continues to work closely with the White House on 
a comprehensive implementation and communication plan that has multiple points of 
contact with transitioning Servicemembers and Veterans beginning prior to separation 
and continuing throughout the first year.  An initial progress report is due on July 9, 
2018.  VA also encourages all transitioning Servicemembers and Veterans to contact 
their local VA medical facility or Vet Center to learn about what VHA mental health care 
services may be available.  We note that section 258 of Division J (the Military 
Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018) of the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) requires VA to provide 
information on mental and behavioral health care services to individuals eligible under 
that authority within 180 days of enactment or 180 days of discharge.  It further requires 
coordination with the Secretary of Defense to ensure Servicemembers and those 
separating are provided appropriate information about programs, requirements, and 
procedures.  VA is working to implement this new authority.   
 
REACH VET Initiative 
As part of VA’s commitment to put forth resources, services, and technology to 
reduce Veteran suicide, VA initiated the Recovery Engagement and Coordination for 
Health Veterans Enhanced Treatment (REACH VET) program.  Proactively addressing 
complex care needs, including mental health concerns, can lead to better recovery 
4 
 
outcomes, lessen the likelihood of challenges becoming crises, and reduce the stress 
that Veterans and their loved ones face.  
REACH VET uses clinical and administrative data in Veterans’ medical records 
to identify and proactively engage in care those who may be at risk for hospitalization, 
illness, suicide, and other adverse outcomes.  In short, REACH VET works to help 
inform VA providers of the most vulnerable Veterans under their care.  This program 
finished its first year of full implementation in February 2018 and has identified more 
than 30,000 at-risk Veterans.  REACH VET uses a new predictive model to analyze 
existing data from Veterans’ health records to identify those who are at a statistically 
elevated risk for suicide, hospitalization, illnesses, and other adverse outcomes, so that 
VHA providers can review and enhance care and talk to these Veterans about their 
needs.  REACH VET was expanded to provide risk information about suicide and 
opioids, as well as clinical decision support to Veterans Crisis Line responders and is 
being further expanded to provide this important risk information to frontline VHA 
providers.  REACH VET is limited to Veterans engaged in our health care system and is 
risk-focused, so while it is critically important to those Veterans it touches, it is not 
enough to bring down Veteran suicide rates.  We will continue to take bold action aimed 
at ending all Veteran suicide, not just for those engaged with our system.   
Other than Honorable Initiative   
We know that 14 of the 20 Veterans who, on average, died by suicide each day 
in 2014 did not, for various reasons, receive care within VA in 2013 or 2014.  Our goal is 
to more effectively promote and provide care and assistance to such individuals to the 
maximum extent authorized by law.  To that end, beginning on July 5, 2017, VA 
promoted access to care for emergent mental health care to the more than 500,000 
former Servicemembers who separated from active duty with other than honorable 
(OTH) administrative discharges.  This initiative specifically focuses on providing access 
to former Servicemembers with OTH administrative discharges who are in mental health 
distress and may be at risk for suicide or other adverse behaviors.  As part of this 
initiative, former Servicemembers with OTH administrative discharges who present to 
VA seeking emergency mental health care for a condition related to military service 
would be eligible for evaluation and treatment for their mental health condition.  Such 
individuals may access the VA system for emergency mental health services by visiting 
a VA emergency room, outpatient clinic, Vet Center, or by calling the Veterans Crisis 
Line.  Services may include assessment, medication management/pharmacotherapy, 
lab work, case management, psycho-education, and psychotherapy.  As of 
December 30, 2017, VHA had received 3,241 requests for health care services under 
this program.  In addition, in FY 2017, Readjustment Counseling Services through Vet 
Centers provided services to 1,130 Veterans with “Other than Honorable” administrative 
discharges and provided 9,889 readjustment counseling visits. 
  CARE 
  Veterans deserve greater access, choice, and control over their health care.  VA 
is committed to ensuring Veterans can make decisions that work best for themselves 
5 
 
and their families.  Our current system of providing care for Veterans outside of VA 
requires that Veterans and community providers navigate a complex and confusing 
bureaucracy.  VA is committed to building an improved, integrated network for Veterans, 
community providers, and VA employees; we call these reforms Veteran Coordinated 
Access & Rewarding Experiences, or Veteran CARE.   
Veteran CARE would clarify and simplify eligibility requirements, build a high- 
performing network, streamline clinical and administrative processes, and implement 
new care coordination support for Veterans.  Veteran CARE would improve Veterans’ 
experience and access to health care, building on the best features of existing 
community care programs.  This new program would complement and support VA’s 
internal capacity for the direct delivery of care with an emphasis on Foundational 
Services.  The CARE reforms would provide VA with new tools to compete with the 
private sector on quality and accessibility.  
Demand for community care remains high.  The Veterans Choice Program 
comprised approximately 62 percent of all VA community care completed appointments 
in FY 2017.  We thank Congress for the combined $4.2 billion provided in Calendar 
Year 2017 to continue the Choice Program while discussions continue regarding the 
future of VA community care.  Based on historical trends, current Choice funding is 
expected to run out in the first 2 weeks of June 2018, depending on program utilization.  
VA has partnered with Veterans, community providers, Veterans Service Organizations 
(VSO), and other stakeholders to understand their needs and incorporate crucial input 
into the concept for a consolidated VA community care program.  The time to act is 
now, and we need your help.  We believe we are in agreement that the legislation 
reforming the Choice Program and the Department’s other Community Care Programs 
is our best course of action.  
 
  In FY 2019, the Budget reflects $14.2 billion in total purchasing power to support 
community care for Veterans.  This includes an additional $2.4 billion in discretionary 
funding that is now available as a result of the recently enacted legislation to raise 
discretionary spending caps.  Of this amount, $1.9 billion replaces the mandatory 
funding that was originally requested in FY 2018 to be carried over into FY 2019.  This 
funding will be used to continue the Choice Program for a portion of FY 2019 until VA is 
able to fully implement the Veteran CARE program.  The remaining $500 million will 
support VA’s traditional community care program in FY 2019.  Since the time of the 
budget submission, VA has identified the additional need for continuing the Choice 
Program while transitioning to a new consolidated community care program.  To ensure 
that the House and Senate Appropriations and Veterans’ Affairs Committees are fully 
apprised of our funding requirements for both the Choice Program and traditional 
community care, VA has written to the leadership of all four committees to provide the 
detailed analysis.  Further delay of enacted legislation beyond Memorial Day will result 
in substantially increased spending. 
 
  In order to continue the Choice Program beyond the first 2 weeks of June 2018, 
VA requires $1.3 billion in FY 2018 and an additional $2.0 billion to $3.6 billion 
(dependent on the time of enactment of the legislation) in FY 2019.  This assumes the 
6 
 
Choice Program must continue for 12 months post-enactment of the CARE legislation to 
ensure seamless transition to the new program. 
 
  In addition, VA could require an additional $1.6 billion to $2.1 billion (dependent 
on the time of enactment of the legislation) above our request for the traditional 
community care program due to higher execution in FY 2018, resulting in less carryover 
available in FY 2019, and reimbursement at a higher rate than Medicare.  Some of this 
additional need could be addressed within existing or requested FY 2019 Medical Care 
resources.  
 
Finally, the Budget transitions VA to recording community care obligations on the 
date of payment, rather than the date of authorization.  This change in the timing of 
obligations results in a one-time adjustment of $1.8 billion.  
   
Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) 
 
The Budget invests $1.2 billion in EHRM.  The health and safety of our Veterans 
is one of our highest national priorities.  On June 5, 2017, former Secretary Shulkin 
announced the decision to adopt the same electronic health record (EHR) system as 
DoD.  This transformation is about improving VA services and significantly enhancing 
the coordination of care for Veterans who receive medical care not only from VA, but 
DoD and our community partners.  We have a tremendous opportunity for the future 
with EHRM to build transparency with Veterans and their care providers, expand the 
use of data, and increase our ability to communicate and collaborate with DoD and 
community care providers.  In addition to improving patient care, a single, seamless 
EHR system will result in a more efficient use of VA resources, particularly as it relates 
to health care providers.  Given the magnitude of this transformation and the significant 
long-term costs and complex contracting needs, we requested a single separate 
account for this effort and thank Congress for establishing this account in the FY 2018 
Appropriations Act. 
   
  The FY 2019 Budget continues VA’s investment in technology to improve the 
lives of Veterans.  The planned Information Technology (IT) investments prioritize the 
development of replacements for specific mission critical legacy systems, as well as 
operations and maintenance of all VA IT infrastructure essential to deliver medical care 
and benefits to Veterans.  The request includes $381 million for development to replace 
specific mission critical legacy systems, such as the Benefits Delivery Network and the 
Burial Operations Support System.  Investments in IT will also support efforts and 
initiatives that are directly Veteran-facing, such as mental health applications to support 
suicide prevention, modifications of multiple programs to accommodate special 
requirements of the community care program, Veteran self-service applications 
(Navigator concept), education claims processing integration consolidation, and benefit 
claim appeals modernization.  The Budget also invests $398 million for information 
security to protect Veterans’ information.

The FY 2019 Budget request would increase the Department’s ability to apply 
agile program management to the dynamics of modern IT development requirements.  
To do this, the Department proposes increasing the transfer threshold from $1 million to 
$3 million between development project lines, which equates to less than 1 percent of 
the Development account.  Through the Certification process, Congress will maintain 
visibility of proposed changes.   
 
Improved Management Processes 
 
Another critical system that will touch the delivery of all health and benefits is our 
new financial management system, which is under development.  The FY 2019 budget 
requests $72.8 million in IT funds and $48.8 million in fair share reimbursable funding 
from the Administrations for business process re-engineering to support Financial 
Management Business Transformation across the Department.  These resources 
support the continued modernization of our financial management system by 
transforming the Department from numerous stovepipe legacy systems to a proven, 
flexible, shared service business transaction environment.  Even though the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) is not moving forward as VA’s Federal Shared 
Service Provider, VA continues to work with USDA to ensure a smooth transition.  VA’s 
Office of Finance continues to manage the program and the implementation is on 
schedule and within budget.  In fact, I am pleased to report that the roll out of the first 
module, the Budget Formulation module, occurred as planned on March 26, 2018.   
This was the first major milestone and its success reflects the commitment of everyone 
involved.   
VA also has implemented an initiative to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and 
abuse (STOP FWA).  In support of this initiative, VA (1) established the VA Prevention 
of Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Advisory Committee, which will provide VA insight into best 
practices utilized in the private and public sector; (2) is partnering with Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services to replicate their investigation process and utilize their 
data to identify medical providers with performance issues; and (3) is working with the 
Department of  the Treasury to perform a deep dive to move VA’s Community Care 
Program closer to the industry best practices.  
Another critical system VA is significantly improving relates to employee 
accountability.  The vast majority of employees are dedicated to providing Veterans the 
care they have earned and deserve.  It is unfortunate that some employees have 
tarnished the reputation of VA while so many have dedicated their lives to serving our 
Nation’s Veterans.  We will not tolerate employees who deviate from VA’s I-CARE 
(Integrity, Commitment, Advocacy, Respect, and Excellence) values and underlying 
responsibility to provide the best level of care and services to them.  Last May, VA 
established the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection.  Between 
June 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017, VA removed more than 900 staff (not including 
probationary terminations) and placed more than 250 staff on suspensions of 14 days or 
greater.  We thank Congress for passing the Department of Veterans Affairs 
Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-41), so that new 
accountability rules for VA are now the law of the land.  
8 
 
We are also focused on improving our unduly burdensome internal hiring 
practices.  In the face of a national shortage of health care providers, VHA faces 
competition with the commercial sector for scarce resources.  Over the past year, we 
reduced the time it took to hire Medical Center Directors by 40 percent and obtained 
approval from the Office of Personnel Management for critical position pay authority for 
many of our senior health care leaders.  But there is much work left to do.  We need 
Congress’s help with legislation to reform recruitment and compensation practices 
allowing VA to stay competitive with the private sector and other employers.  
 
Infrastructure Improvements and Streamlining 
 
I want to thank Congress for providing $2 billion in additional funding for VA’s 
infrastructure in the FY 2018 Omnibus.  This funding, which was focused on minor 
construction, non-recurring maintenance, and State Home Construction Grants, will 
greatly enhance our ability to address critical infrastructure needs, including funding the 
first 52 of the 61 State Home Grants in funding order on the Priority List Group 1.  In FY 
2019, VA will continue to focus on improving its infrastructure while we transform our 
health care system to an integrated network to serve Veterans.  This budget requests 
$1.1 billion in Major Construction funding, as well as $706.9 million in Minor 
Construction, for priority infrastructure projects.  This funding supports projects including 
the St. Louis, Missouri, Jefferson Barracks Medical Facility Improvements and 
Cemetery Expansion project; the Canandaigua, New York, Construction and 
Renovation project; the Dallas, Texas, Spinal Cord Injury project; and national cemetery 
expansions in Rittman, Ohio; Mims, Florida; and Holly, Michigan.  VA is also requesting 
$972 million to fund more than 2,100 medical leases in FY 2019 and $672.1 million for 
activation of new medical facilities.   
 
VA appreciates the support of Congress and is grateful for the passage of the VA 
Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-46), which included authorization 
for 28 major medical leases, some of which had been pending authorization for 
approximately 3 years.  The leases will establish new points of care, expand sites of 
care, replace expiring leases, and expand VA’s research capabilities.  In FY 2019, VA is 
seeking Congressional authorization of four new outpatient clinic leases to expand 
services currently offered at existing clinics.  The requested leases would be located in 
the vicinities of Lawrence, Indiana; Plano, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and 
Beaumont, Texas. 
The FY 2019 Budget includes a new initiative to address VA’s highest priority 
facilities in need of seismic repairs and upgrades.  VA’s major construction request 
includes $400 million that will be dedicated to correct critical seismic issues that 
currently threaten the safety of Veterans and VA staff at VA facilities.  The seismic 
program would fund newly identified unfunded, existing, and partially-funded seismic 
projects within VA’s major, minor, and non-recurring maintenance programs.   
VA’s FY 2019 Budget includes proposed legislative requests, consistent with the 
Veteran Coordinated Access & Rewarding Experiences (CARE) Act draft bill that VA 
submitted last fall, which, if enacted, would increase the Department’s flexibility to meet 
9 
 
its capital needs.  These proposals include:  1) increasing from $10 million to $20 million 
the dollar threshold for minor construction projects; 2) modifying title 38 to eliminate 
statutory impediments to joint facility projects with DoD and other Federal agencies; and 
3) expanding VA’s enhanced use lease authority to give VA more opportunities to 
engage the private sector and local governments to repurpose underutilized VA 
property.  
 
To maximize resources for Veterans, VA repurposed or disposed of 131 of 430 
vacant or mostly vacant buildings since June 2017.  VA is on track to meet the goal that 
was set in June 2017 for VA to initiate disposal or reuse actions for all 430 buildings by 
June 2019.  
For over a decade, the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has achieved 
the highest customer satisfaction rating of any organization—public or private—in the 
country.  They achieved this designation through the American Customer Satisfaction 
Index six consecutive times.  The President’s FY 2019 Budget enables the continuation 
of this unprecedented success with a request for $315.8 million for NCA in FY 2019.  
This request will support the 1,941 FTE employees needed to meet NCA’s increasing 
workload and expansion of services.  In FY 2019, NCA will inter over 134,000 Veterans 
and eligible family members and care for over 3.8 million gravesites.  NCA will continue 
to memorialize Veterans by providing 364,850 headstones and markers, distributing 
677,500 Presidential Memorial Certificates, and expanding the Veterans Legacy 
Program to communities across the country.  VA is committed to investing in NCA 
infrastructure, particularly to keep existing national cemeteries open and to construct 
new cemeteries consistent with burial policies approved by Congress.  In addition to 
NCA’s funding, the FY 2019 request includes $117.2 million in major construction funds 
for three gravesite expansion projects.  The budget also includes $45 million for the 
Veteran Cemetery Grant Program to continue important partnerships with states and 
tribal organizations.  Upon completion of these expansion projects, and the opening of 
new national, state, and tribal cemeteries, nearly 95 percent of the total Veteran 
population —about 20 million Veterans—will have access to a burial option in a national 
or grant-funded state Veterans’ cemetery within 75 miles of their home. 
 
Accelerating Processing of Disability Claims 
 
Since 2013, VA has made remarkable progress toward reducing the backlog of 
disability compensation claims pending over 125 days.  VBA’s FY 2019 budget request 
of $2.9 billion would allow VBA to maintain the improvements made in claims 
processing over the past several years.  This budget prioritizes more timely review of 
1.3 million rating claims and 187,000 higher level reviews to decrease the amount of 
time Veterans wait for a resolution.  It also prioritizes fiduciary care for vulnerable 
beneficiaries to ensure protection for VA’s most vulnerable Veterans who are unable to 
manage their VA benefits.  This budget supports the disability compensation benefits 
program for 4.5 million Veterans and 600,000 survivors.   
To continue improving disability compensation claims processing, VBA has 
implemented an initiative called Decision Ready Claims (DRC).  The DRC initiative 
10 
 
offers Veterans, Servicemembers, and survivors faster supplemental claims decisions 
through a partnership with VSOs and other accredited representatives to assist 
applicants with ensuring all supporting evidence is included with the claim at the time of 
submission, enabling the claim to be decided within 30 days of submission to VA.  Since 
the program’s inception in May 2017, VBA has received over 1,000 DRCs, which have 
received a rating decision in an average of 10.7 days.  VBA remains committed to 
continued growth of the program. 
Decisions on Appeals 
In August 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals 
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-55), which represents the most 
significant statutory change to affect VA claims and appeals in decades and provides 
much-needed reform.  VA is in the process of implementing the new claims and appeals 
system by promulgating regulations, establishing procedures, hiring and training 
personnel, and developing IT systems.  While the modernized appeals system will not 
be fully operative until February 2019, in an effort to provide some of the benefits of the 
new law’s streamlined process, VA has initiated the Rapid Appeals Modernization 
Program (RAMP).  This initiative will allow Veterans with appeals the option to have 
their decisions reviewed in the Higher-Level or Supplemental Claim Lanes, as outlined 
in the new law.  Participation in RAMP is voluntary; however, Veterans can expect to 
receive a review of VA’s initial decision on their claim much faster in RAMP than if they 
were to remain in the legacy appeals process.  As of April 26, 2017, over 14,000 
appellants have opted into RAMP.  By February 2019, all requests for review of VA 
decisions will be processed under the new law, which will provide a more efficient 
claims and appeals process for Veterans, with opportunities for early resolution of 
disagreements with VA decisions.  
The FY 2019 request of $174.8 million for the Board of Veterans’ Appeals (the 
Board) will sustain the 1,025 FTE who will adjudicate and process legacy appeals while 
implementing the Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act.  The Board is currently 
on pace to produce over 81,000 decisions, a historic level of production.   
In addition, VBA is also undertaking a similar, multi-pronged approach to 
modernize its appeals process through legislative reform, increased resources, 
technology, process improvements, and increased efficiencies.  The requested $74 
million for appeals processing increases VBA’s appeals FTEs by 605.   
This increase comes after VBA realigned its administrative appeals program 
under the Appeals Management Office in January 2017, as part of an effort to 
streamline and improve performance in legacy appeals processing.  The improved 
focus and accountability resulting from this realignment helped increase VBA appeals 
production by 24 percent, decrease its appeals inventory by 10 percent, and increase its 
appeals resolutions by 10 percent, resolving over 124,000 appeals during FY 2017.   
Finally, Digital Service at VA worked closely with the Department to develop an 
appeal status tracker on Vets.gov.  This tracker, which allows Veterans to obtain real-
11 
 
time information regarding the status of their benefit appeals, including an estimated 
wait time and place in line, went live in March 2018.  In demonstrations to stakeholders 
initial responses have been positive.  Digital Service is building infrastructure that will 
support the status update for the new modernized appeals. 
 
Forever GI Bill 
 
The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 or the 
Forever GI Bill contains 34 new provisions, the vast majority of which will enhance or 
expand education benefits for Veterans, Servicemembers, families, and survivors.  Most 
notably, this new law removes the 15-year time limitation for Veterans who transitioned 
out of the military after January 1, 2013, to use their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.  This law 
also restores benefits to Veterans who were impacted by school closures since 2015, 
expands benefits for certain Reservists, surviving dependents, and Purple Heart 
recipients, and provides many other improvements.  Several of the 34 provisions were 
effective on the date of enactment, while the remaining provisions have future effective 
dates ranging from January 1, 2018, to August 1, 2022. 
 
Closing 
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to address our FY 2019 
budget and FY 2020 AA budget requests.  These resources will honor the President’s 
commitment to Veterans by continuing to enable the high-quality care and benefits our 
Veterans have earned and ensure that VA is a source of pride for Veterans, 
beneficiaries, employees, and taxpayers.  I ask for your support in funding our full FY 
2019 and FY 2020 AA budget requests and continued partnership in making bold 
changes to improve our ability to serve Veterans.  We look forward to your questions.

STATEMENT OF 
GENERAL JOSEPH F. DUNFORD, JR., USMC 
19TH CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BUDGET HEARING 
MAY 9, 2018

Chairman Shelby, Vice Chairman Durbin, distinguished members of this 
committee, thank you for the opportunity to join Secretary Mattis and Under 
Secretary Norquist in appearing before you today. It is an honor to represent 
the men and women of the United States military. 
Today, the U.S. Armed Forces have a competitive advantage over any potential 
adversary. We are capable of meeting all the requirements associated with 
defending the homeland and our way of life, and we can meet every one of our 
alliance commitments. I am confident we can prevail in any armed conflict. 
That said, one of my greatest concerns as Chairman is the erosion of our 
competitive advantage over time. 
Last summer, I testified that after years of sustained operational commitments, 
budgetary instability, and advances by our adversaries, our competitive 
advantage was eroding. I assessed that, without sustained, sufficient, and 
predictable funding, within five years, the U.S. military would lose its 
advantage in power projection—the basis for how we defend the homeland, 
advance U.S. interests, and meet our alliance commitments. 
I estimated that arresting the erosion of our competitive advantage required 
real budget growth of at least three percent above inflation across the Future 
Years Defense Plan (FYDP), and restoring it would cost more. This figure 
represented the minimum investment necessary to rebuild readiness and 
modernize key warfighting systems while continuing to meet operational 
requirements.  
Driven by the National Defense Strategy (NDS), the Fiscal Year 2019 (FY19) 
Budget Request builds on the FY17 and FY18 budgets and supports rebuilding 
the U.S. military into the lethal and ready Joint Force the nation needs. 
However, we cannot reverse a decade-plus of erosion in one fiscal year. The 
Department must continue to receive sufficient, sustained, and predictable 
funding for the foreseeable future to restore our competitive advantage and 
ensure we never send our sons and daughters into a fair fight.

Strategic Environment 
The 2018 NDS recognizes that “The central challenge to U.S. prosperity and 
security is the reemergence of long-term, strategic competition by… revisionist 
powers.” The Joint Force must face this long-term threat while still managing 
the immediate challenges posed by rogue regimes and terrorists. With China 
and Russia as the priority, we continue to use North Korea, Iran, and violent 
extremist organizations to inform our planning, force design, force 
development, and risk assessments. 
Our adversaries—particularly China and Russia—continue to develop concepts 
and invest in capabilities specifically designed to counter our advantages. The 
United States military is in a fierce competition to harness the benefits of 
emerging technologies—including hypersonics, artificial intelligence, directed 
energy, and biotechnology—as these developments will fundamentally change 
the character of war. China and Russia are also increasingly active and adept 
at what we call “competition short of armed conflict”: integrating economic 
coercion, political influence, criminal activity, military posturing, 
unconventional warfare, and information and cyber operations to coerce 
opponents, advance their interests, and create strategic advantages without 
triggering a conventional armed response. 
China intends to become a global military power and is building the capability 
to do so. Militarily, China seeks to limit our access and undermine our 
important alliances in the Indo-Pacific. They are developing a full range of air, 
maritime, space, and cyber capabilities while modernizing their nuclear 
enterprise. Their continued militarization of the South and East China Seas 
reflects their disregard for a rules-based international order. They are 
increasing their diplomatic and economic influence through the Belt and Road 
Initiative, and their military interests have followed this enterprise into South 
Asia, the Indian Ocean, and beyond. We continue to seek Chinese cooperation 
4 
 
on a number of fronts, especially with respect to North Korea, but their “strong-
rule-the-weak” foreign policy approach is incompatible with U.S. interests. 
Russia also continues to modernize and invest across the full range of military 
capability, including new aircraft, submarines, armor, counter-space, air 
defense systems, and conventional and nuclear strike capabilities. These 
investments and activities are specifically designed to limit our power 
projection capability and undermine the credibility of U.S. alliances, especially 
NATO. 
While modernizing and preparing for long-term competition and potential 
armed conflict with these revisionist powers, we must also manage the ongoing 
challenges of rogue regimes and violent extremist organizations.  
Although I remain cautiously optimistic about the potential for talks in the 
near future, North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear and missile capability is 
perhaps the most immediate threat to the security of the United States and our 
Allies. In 2017, North Korea conducted an unprecedented 17 ballistic missile 
test events, two of which overflew our treaty Ally, Japan. Last year also saw 
North Korea’s first successful tests of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles 
(ICBMs) capable of ranging the continental United States—and they tested a 
nuclear device designed for ICBM delivery. I have testified to Congress several 
times in recent months about Pyongyang’s accelerated capability development 
and the threats it poses to U.S. interests, to our Allies in the Pacific, and to the 
homeland.  
Iran continues to project malign influence and threaten freedom of navigation 
in the Middle East. They are also modernizing their space, cyber, missile, and 
conventional maritime capabilities, which pose a direct threat to our Allies and 
our interests in the region.  
We continue to grapple with the challenge of violent extremism, including ISIS, 
a resurgent al Qaida, and associated movements. Our strategy remains focused 
on cutting the flow of finances, foreign fighters, and their disruptive narrative, 
5 
 
while working by, with, and through local partners to sustain pressure on their 
networks, disrupt attacks, and dismantle their capabilities.  
Defending our homeland, our Allies, and our interests in the near-term while 
restoring our competitive advantage and building lethality will require a 
focused and sustained effort over many years. 
 
Where We Are Today 
Fortunately, with your support, we have begun to arrest the erosion of our 
competitive advantage. The additional appropriation in FY17 supported 
immediate investments in readiness, including increases to end strength, 
funding for critical training, initial restoration of ammunition stocks, and 
continued modernization of critical systems. 
PB18 builds on the readiness recovery started in FY17 and begins to balance 
the program. It allows the Department to meet operational requirements, begin 
rebuilding mid- and long-term readiness, and restore warfighting capability 
and capacity. 
While we are grateful for the FY18 appropriation, we spent the first six months 
of FY18 with FY17 funding levels. The flexibility provided in recent legislation 
will enable the Department to execute the FY18 budget responsibly. This 
includes easing the 80/20 rule (that prevents obligating more than 20% of a 
one-year appropriation in the last two months of the fiscal year) and raising the 
Below Threshold Reprogramming amounts. Though these measures will help 
the Department utilize FY18 funds effectively, we need predictable funding in 
FY19 and beyond to restore our competitive military advantage.  
The Department’s FY19 budget funds ongoing operations, builds on FY18 
readiness improvements, and supports the NDS by investing in modernization 
for high-end competition against near-peer adversaries.  
6 
 
Operations. Our first budget priority is to provide our deployed servicemembers 
the resources they need to effectively accomplish their missions—whether in 
active contingencies, deterring adversaries, assuring Allies, or building partner 
capacity. 
PB19 supports deterrence and assurance efforts around the world. In the 
Pacific theater, this budget accelerates substantial construction projects to 
improve the infrastructure that facilitates power projection in the region. It 
funds prepositioning of critical munitions, increased intelligence activity, and 
increased rotational troop presence. PB19 also improves missile defense by 
deploying 20 additional Ground Based Interceptors, with redesigned kill 
vehicles, at Fort Greely, Alaska across the FYDP. To deter Russian aggression, 
this budget fully funds the European Deterrence Initiative, increasing the 
number and quality of exercises with our NATO Allies, deploying key U.S.-
based enablers, and modernizing prepositioned stocks. It also recapitalizes the 
Integrated Undersea Surveillance System, enhancing our ability to detect 
Russian submarines. 
This budget provides $69 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), 
the bulk of which funds operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. In 
Afghanistan, we are working toward a sustainable approach to stabilizing the 
Afghan government and denying terrorist sanctuary. In Iraq and Syria, we 
remain committed to eliminating the remnants of ISIS and setting the 
conditions to ensure ISIS cannot return. OCO funding also supports Operation 
ENDURING FREEDOM-Horn of Africa and counterterrorism efforts in 
northwest Africa and the Philippines. 
The FY19 funding for ongoing operations not only ensures our deployed 
servicemembers have what they need to execute missions in Iraq, Syria, and 
Afghanistan, but also makes conflict less likely by assuring Allies and deterring 
aggression in key strategic theaters.  
7 
 
Readiness. Ensuring our forces are able to meet current operational 
requirements and rebuild the readiness required for great power competition 
requires significant, continued investment in readiness. PB19 builds on the 
readiness gains of PB18 by adding end strength, accelerating training, and 
increasing capacity to extend our readiness focus to the mid- and long-term. 
This budget adds modest end strength to each of the services, allowing them to 
fill gaps in existing combat formations, address critical shortfalls in aviation 
maintenance, and increase manning in cyber and information warfare. The Air 
Force will address pilot shortages by adding two new training squadrons, 
enabling the production of 125 additional new pilots per year. 
PB19 funds flight hour programs and ground combat training accounts to 
near-maximum executable levels. The Air Force upgrades training ranges and 
funds weapons system sustainment, while the Army funds an unprecedented 
20 Combat Training Center rotations for Brigade Combat Teams. 
PB19 also increases available capacity for all of the Services. The Navy funds 
service life extensions for six cruisers, as well as infrastructure, spares, and 
ship depot maintenance. The Army will create a 16th Armored Brigade Combat 
Team while accelerating fielding of four Security Force Assistance Brigades. 
This budget also adds necessary capacity in air defense, mobile rocket artillery, 
and operational command and control in Europe. PB19 also funds munitions 
inventory levels sufficient to meet multiple demands across theaters.  
Finally, we will improve readiness by refining our global force management 
processes to achieve strategic flexibility and freedom of action. As directed by 
the NDS, Dynamic Force Employment will allow us to proactively shape the 
environment through scalable military presence and quickly deploy forces for 
emerging requirements while preserving long-term warfighting readiness.  
8 
 
PB19’s investments in readiness build on the gains made in the past two years 
and are foundational to ensuring the U.S. military is ready to meet the 
challenges of today and tomorrow. 
 
What We Must Do 
The competitive military advantage we enjoy today is the result of capabilities 
developed by our Services in an era of unchallenged technological dominance. 
That era has now passed. Seventeen years of combat and seven years of budget 
instability have forced us to postpone modernization investments for the sake 
of near-term readiness. Meanwhile, our adversaries’ investments in 
modernization have outpaced our own. As a result, the distinction between 
readiness and modernization has grown harder to discern. We must modernize 
now in order to be ready.  
Restoring our competitive advantage in an era of great power competition will 
require a joint approach to concept and capability development, an ability to 
leverage cutting edge technology and asymmetric solutions, and sustained and 
predictable budgets. PB19 begins this restoration through targeted investments 
that develop the lethal, agile, and innovative Joint Force demanded by the 
threats of 2025 and beyond. 
The Service Chiefs recently briefed you on their investments in the lethality of 
their individual Services. The following are priority investment areas for joint 
warfighting.  
Nuclear. A safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent is essential to defending 
the homeland. Starting in the early 1990s, the Joint Force deemphasized the 
role of nuclear weapons, reducing our nuclear forces in both weapon types and 
overall size, and trading nuclear strength for arms control. Other nuclear-
armed states did not follow our lead, choosing instead to embark on 
modernization and expansion efforts.   
9 
 
In accordance with the recently published Nuclear Posture Review, we will 
invest $24 billion in FY19 to sustain and recapitalize the nuclear enterprise. 
This is a significant step in a 23-year program to recapitalize the all three legs 
of our aging strategic triad, our non-strategic nuclear forces, and our command 
and control systems. Initial delivery of modernized bombers and dual-capable 
aircraft (F-35s) is slated for the mid-2020s; we will achieve initial operating 
capability of modernized ground-based missiles in 2029; and the first 
modernized ballistic missile submarine will be operational in 2031. Nuclear 
deterrence is the highest priority mission for the Joint Force, and a truly joint 
enterprise. There is no margin remaining in the modernization schedule—we 
must deliver these critical programs on the established timelines. 
Space. Unlike previous eras, when space was considered a benign and 
unchallenged environment, space is now a contested domain. The U.S. military 
depends on space-based capabilities to enable successful joint warfighting—
specifically for intelligence collection; missile warning; weather monitoring; 
global communications; and precision positioning, navigation, and timing.  
Potential adversaries understand the advantages space provides, and they view 
our reliance on this domain as a vulnerability they can exploit. Our near-peer 
competitors are increasingly challenging our competitive advantage in space.  
We must bolster our space sensor architecture to improve our ability to 
characterize new and future threats. This budget builds on FY18 investments 
with a focus on space resiliency and mission assurance. It accelerates 
procurement of the next generation of space-based infrared systems to field a 
modernized, resilient space-based missile warning capability. Other 
investments focus on resilient systems for navigation, communications, and 
situational awareness. Given rapid advances in our adversaries’ capabilities, 
the space domain will require continuous investment in future years. 
Cyberspace. Cyberattacks threaten our military, our economy, and our society. 
Although China and Russia remain the greatest threats to U.S. security, Iran, 
10 
 
North Korea, and violent extremist organizations have all increased their 
capabilities and are aggressively conducting malicious activities in cyberspace. 
Most of these occur below the threshold of open warfare, but they are injurious 
nonetheless, and their implications for armed conflict are clear. FY19 cyber 
investments continue to prioritize defense of DoD information networks while 
improving offensive and defensive operations, building Cyber Mission Forces, 
and maturing command and control. 
Electronic Warfare (EW). From voice and data communication to surveillance 
and targeting, every Joint Force operation today relies on access to the 
electromagnetic spectrum. As with space and cyber, potential adversaries see 
this reliance as a vulnerability they can exploit. The proliferation of technology 
has made electronic attacks both cheaper and more effective. To preserve our 
advantage in EW, PB19 invests in both offensive and defensive systems while 
exploring new concepts to maximize the effectiveness of our multi-domain EW 
capabilities.  
Missile Defense. Our missile defense systems serve to protect the homeland, 
assure our Allies and partners, and deter adversaries. But the breadth of 
missile threats facing the Joint Force continues to increase in complexity and 
scope. Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran are all extending their operational 
reach and fielding larger and more capable arsenals. Their systems are 
increasingly mobile and resilient, with increased range and accuracy, 
expanding the risks they pose around the globe. Furthermore, they continue to 
develop means of complicating our missile defense operations. Among other 
investments and activities to counter this threat, we are increasing the number 
of Ground Based Interceptors and investing in additional Terminal High 
Altitude Area Defense and SM-3 interceptors. 
While developing and refining the capabilities that will restore our advantage in 
competitive areas like these, we must accelerate research and development and 
experimentation in important fields with military implications. PB19 will see 
11 
 
increased investments in technologies such as hypersonics, artificial 
intelligence, directed energy, and biotechnology. We will also continue to refine 
our acquisition systems to enable rapid fielding of new capabilities. 
Across the Joint Force, PB19 starts, accelerates, or continues funding for 
critical modernization efforts. These programs will require years of sustained 
funding to deliver material results, but they are all vital to ensuring the future 
force is capable of defending the homeland and advancing U.S. interests in the 
competitive security environment to come. 
 
Conclusion 
To implement the National Defense Strategy, the Joint Force requires 
sustained, sufficient, and predictable funding. The funding levels in the recent 
Bipartisan Budget Agreement are sufficient; I look forward to working with 
Congress to make our funding sustained and predictable so we can fully 
restore our competitive military advantage. 
PB19 represents a significant investment in the lethal Joint Force the United 
States will need to prevail in future conflicts. We are committed to the 
responsible, disciplined, and transparent use of that investment. With your 
continued help and commitment, we will ensure we never send America’s sons 
and daughters into a fair fight.

Statement of Carla Hayden 
The Librarian of Congress 
 
Before the  
Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch 
Committee on Appropriations 
United States Senate 
May 8, 2018 
 
Chairman Daines, Ranking Member Murphy, and Members of the Subcommittee:  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of the Library’s fiscal 2019 
budget.   
 
Now in my second year as Librarian of Congress, I am even more committed to doing all I can 
to share the breadth and depth of the Library’s collections and our staff’s expertise and 
commitment to public service.  Today, the Library holds more than 167 million items in all 
formats and languages and has the world’s largest collections of legal materials, films, and 
sound recordings.  Last year, the Library welcomed nearly 1.8 million in-person visitors and 
there were 93 million visits to our web site.  CRS provided custom services to 100 percent of 
Senate and House member offices and standing committees.  More than 452 thousand claims 
were registered by the U.S. Copyright Office.  More than 10.5 million preservation actions on 
the collections were undertaken; over 20 million audio/braille books and magazines were 
circulated via partnerships with more than 100 network libraries throughout the United States; 
and the Library responded to over 1 million reference requests from the Congress, the public, 
and other federal agencies.    
 
Over the past year, the Library has made significant strides in increasing access to Congress and 
the American people.  The Copyright Office published a new archive, a resource offering public 
rulings and government briefs in copyright cases.  CRS worked to modernize its service to 
Congress by joining the Skype for Business Federation, which this year enabled instant mes-
saging and teleconferencing with congressional staff.  The Library launched LC Labs and, 
working with the Serials division, rolled out a new crowd sourcing app inviting users to help 
create a database of historic newspaper images from Chronicling America.  New “touch 
history” tours allow visitors who are visually impaired to experience the magnificence of the 
Jefferson Building.  The Law Library further expanded online content with fully indexed and 
searchable U.S. Codes going back to 1925.  New collections have been made available online, 
such as the papers of Alexander Hamilton and James Buchanan, and new high-resolution scans 
of the original documents in the Abraham Lincoln papers.   
 
I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the outstanding support that this committee 
and the entire Congress give to the Library.  In particular, I appreciate the support you have 
given us for our fiscal 2018 requests to meet high-priority staffing needs in the Copyright Office 
1 
 
as well as enterprise-wide investment in IT modernization to upgrade network infrastructure, 
Copyright IT modernization, and the Congressional Research Service’s (CRS) mission-specific 
Integrated Research and Information System.  The Library has absorbed 76.5 percent of 
mandatory pay and price level increases (approximately $122 million) between 2010 and 2017.  
Your strong support for staffing resources allows us to better handle critical work and to begin 
replacing specialized staff expertise that was developed over many years and lost - principally 
to retirement - and not replaced due to budget limitations.  I also thank you for your continued 
support for the Library’s collection storage modules program at Ft. Meade as part of the 
Architect of the Capitol’s budget.  
 
I come before you today to discuss the Library’s funding request for fiscal 2019 as we continue 
implementation of a modernization process across the Library that will expand access, provide 
superior customer service, and ensure proper stewardship of the national collection.   
 
In the past year, I have taken steps to ensure an administrative foundation is in place to support 
and lead us toward these goals.  
 
I appointed Mark Sweeney as Acting Deputy Librarian of Congress.  Prior to his current 
appointment, Mr. Sweeney served as the Associate Librarian for Library Services.  He was 
responsible for carrying out Library Services’ mission to acquire, organize, provide access to, 
maintain, secure, and preserve the Library of Congress’s universal collection.  
 
In December, all service unit IT organizations and all IT personnel were centralized into the 
Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) to maximize value from the Library’s investment 
in technology.  All technology activities are now coordinated through the OCIO and approved 
by the Chief Information Officer.  
   
In the same month, we saw the results of the first phase of our Envisioning 2025 initiative, 
which will inform a five-year strategic plan to guide all service units in working toward shared 
goals.  In the first phase, the Library more clearly defined its role in American life as that of a 
place for memory, knowledge, and imagination:  
MEMORY – Acquire, sustain, and provide access to a unique universal collection  
KNOWLEDGE – Provide authoritative and objective research, analysis, and information  
IMAGINATION – Inspire and encourage creativity, promote, and protect the work of     
American creators 
 
The Library’s direction forward, as defined in Envisioning 2025, will be more “user-centered.” 
The Congress will always be the Library’s foremost user as we continue to support this body in 
your legislative and representational duties. Users also encompass creators, inclusive but not 
limited to copyright users and stakeholders; individual learners of any age who seek 
understanding and knowledge through the Library’s collections and services; and connectors 
who are external communities such as libraries, schools, or other groups and institutions that 
connect users to the Library.   
2 
 
 
Thank you for the supporting the Library’s efforts to revitalize and enhance the visitor 
experience in the Thomas Jefferson Building through a public/private partnership.  This is an 
exciting future direction for the Library as we bring the nation’s collections and history out of 
the vaults and into public spaces.  Through expanded and improved access to the national 
treasures in the Library, visitors will be inspired to use our collections just as we have 
envisioned in 2025 and beyond.   
 
I am confident that we have a strong management structure and robust strategic planning 
process to lead the Library into the future. Now, however, I ask for your assistance in helping 
us take the additional steps we need with an increase in funding for critical initiatives.  
 
The Library of Congress fiscal 2019 budget request is for approximately $761 million, which 
represents a 5.9 percent increase over the Library’s fiscal 2018 enacted appropriation.  Of the 
requested $42 million increase, 52 percent accounts for mandatory pay and price level increases 
($22.0 million).  The balance of the increase represents critical program investments necessary to 
fulfill the Library’s role and to move forward on the commitment to be more user-centered.  
 
This request extends and builds on the modernization efforts initiated in 2017 and 2018, which 
concentrated on information technology (IT) modernization, a strong workforce, and increased 
access. The Library continues to embrace modernization, not only of its IT but of its workforce, 
infrastructure, and collections stewardship. 
 
The Library’s staff is essential to fulfilling its memory role – acquiring, sustaining, and 
providing access to a unique universal collection.  We must foster the correct mix of skillsets to 
achieve this. We are also employing digitization and other technologies as a means of 
expanding access to memory even with fewer staff.  The budget request includes an investment 
to strengthen staffing capacity for processing special collections where a significant backlog has 
emerged over the last ten years.  This would include such works as the Herman Wouk and 
Caspar Weinberger papers, which are currently stored in thousands of containers inaccessible to 
users.  Our request also seeks to dramatically increase access through two digitization efforts.  
The first to preserve and make accessible historic copyright records and, the second, in the Law 
Library to make public domain U.S. legal and legislative materials and foreign law materials 
more widely available.   
 
Next, our budget submission strengthens the Library’s role in knowledge, in its capacity to 
provide authoritative research and analysis in areas of significant congressional interest in the 
CRS, and foreign legal and language expertise in the Law Library. 
 
The CRS workforce has decreased by approximately 13 percent in the last eight years, losing 92 
FTE, and 23 percent of CRS staff will be eligible for retirement this year.  In fiscal 2016, CRS 
received 563,000 requests for products and services, including more than 61,400 requests for 
custom research and analysis.   Demand is expected to remain at these levels or higher in the 
3 
 
future.   Additional FTE in CRS will strengthen analytic capacity and ensure replacement of 
corporate knowledge over time as retirements and attrition take place. 
 
The Copyright Office and its work is central to the Library’s role of inspiring and encouraging 
creativity.  Our quest for Copyright IT modernization has continued in successive budgets with 
infrastructure and networking.   Now, in the fiscal 2019 budget, we turn to the development of 
the Next Generation Registration System and a modern recordation system.   The Library’s 
commitment to a modernized and well-staffed Copyright Office is reflected in requests for a 
modernization enterprise solution, restoration of the registration examiner workforce to pre-
sequestration levels, and contractor support to aggressively address a recordation backlog 
before the data is migrated to a new, modernized system.  We are specifically targeting areas 
where backlogs have emerged due to attrition, retirement, or increased activity. 
 
Shared operating capacity allows the Library to be more efficient and cost-effective as we work 
to achieve our goals.  The Congressionally sanctioned Legislative Branch Financial Management 
System (LBFMS), hosted by the Library as a shared service for the legislative branch has been a 
success story.  It has experienced substantial growth and now provides the financial system for 
eight legislative branch agencies.  From 2015 to 2017, the number of users has increased 44 
percent and the number of transactions processed by 140 percent.  As a shared service, the 
LBFMS averages a combined annual $2.5 million in cost avoidance, compared to operating 
separate systems through federal shared services providers.  Accompanying this growth and 
success is the need to standardize the system across the user agencies.  To accommodate these 
growing pains, our budget request provides for process standardization across the user 
agencies to decrease the need for costly customizations over time and increased hosting costs 
for this shared system.   
 
In closing, modernization – of workforce, infrastructure, collections stewardship, as well as IT – 
is critical to moving the Library forward into the future.  The fiscal 2019 budget request furthers 
the modernization efforts of recent budget requests and targets critical workforce needs. 
 
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Murphy, and Members of the Subcommittee, the Library is the 
embodiment of the American ideal of a knowledge-based democracy.  I thank you again for 
supporting the Library of Congress and for your consideration of our fiscal 2019 request.

WRITTEN TESTIMONY 
OF 
KIRSTJEN M. NIELSEN 
SECRETARY 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
FOR A HEARING ON 
“THE FISCAL YEAR 2019 DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY BUDGET” 
 
BEFORE THE 
 
                        UNITED STATES SENATE 
                        COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
                      SUBCOMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY 
 
Tuesday, May 8, 2018 
Washington, DC 
 
Chairman Capito, Ranking Member Tester, and distinguished Members of the 
Subcommittee: 
 
It is a privilege to appear before you today to discuss the Department of Homeland Security’s 
(DHS) crucial missions and to present the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget request for 
the Department. 
 
The men and women of DHS are exceptional and dedicated professionals who are on watch 24 
hours a day, 365 days a year protecting Americans from threats by land, sea, air, and in 
cyberspace, while also promoting our Nation’s economic prosperity. They work tirelessly to 
strengthen the safety and security of our Nation from persistent and emerging dangers, including 
terrorists, transnational criminal organizations, rogue nation states, and natural disasters. 
 
The FY 2019 Budget request provides funding to advance core DHS missions. It sustains and 
strengthens our most critical programs and capabilities and places emphasis on protecting our 
nation from terrorism and countering threats; securing and managing our borders and enforcing 
our immigration laws; preserving and upholding the nation’s prosperity and economic security; 
securing cyberspace and critical infrastructure; and strengthening homeland security 
preparedness resilience. DHS will also build a culture of efficiency on the foundation of agency 
reform efforts to ensure accountable, effective, and efficient operations. 
 
The FY 2019 President’s Budget for DHS requests $47.5 billion in net discretionary funding and 
an additional $6.7 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for response and recovery to major 
disasters. 
 
This Budget would make crucial investments needed to secure our borders against threats and 
illegal entry. The request includes recruitment, hiring, and training of 750 additional U.S. Border 
Patrol Agents, 2,000 additional U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) law 
enforcement officers, and more than 1,500 support staff needed to more robustly execute the 
Department’s border security and immigration enforcement missions. It also funds construction 
and renovations at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers to meet increased training 
requirements for DHS. 
 
Investments in our layered defense at the border would include 65 miles of new border wall 
construction in the highest-traffic zones along the southwest border, as well as priority tactical 
infrastructure, border security technology improvements, and aircraft acquisition. The 
Administration also reiterates the unfunded wall requests from the FY 2018 Budget in addition to 
the investments outlined in the FY 2019 Budget. These investments ensure DHS law 
enforcement personnel are supported with effective surveillance technology and equipment to 
improve their ability to detect and interdict illegal activity. 
 
The FY 2019 President’s Budget includes funding for 52,000 detention beds, including 2,500 
beds reserved for family units, to ensure that apprehended aliens who are subject to removal 
from the United States—such as illegal border crossers, criminal aliens, and national security 
threats—are detained in safe and secure detention facilities pending their removal. For 
apprehended aliens who are not considered a threat to our communities, but who may pose a 
diminished flight risk, the President’s Budget would fund ICE’s Alternatives to Detention 
Program to provide intensive supervision for up to 82,000 average daily participants through a 
combination of home visits, office visits, alert response and electronic monitoring. Proposed 
funding for removal operations will facilitate the complex coordination required to return 
aliens safely and expeditiously to their home countries and pay for transportation costs. 
 
Unfortunately, some of these critical missions are impeded by jurisdictions that refuse to 
cooperate with DHS in the enforcement of federal law. This makes it more dangerous for federal 
agents and officers to do their jobs. And it creates a greater threat to public safety, and results in 
greater expense to American taxpayers. I hope the Committee will work with DHS to help make 
sure jurisdictions around the country do not harbor criminal aliens or put the men and women of 
DHS at risk while they are doing their jobs to protect the public. 
 
The Budget gives our frontline operators the tools and resources they need to more aggressively 
disrupt and dismantle transnational threats. It would advance the Administration’s efforts to 
block terrorists, criminals, and other nefarious actors from reaching the United States and 
exploiting our immigration system. It would further integrate intelligence into DHS operations to 
make sure rapid changes in the threat environment are met with a near-real-time change in our 
response. And it proposes funding across the Department for initiatives that will help us keep 
pace with adaptive enemies and new threats. 
 
For example, the Budget focuses on bolstering DHS activities to counter transnational criminal 
organizations (TCOs). TCOs are facilitating the illicit flow of opioids and other deadly 
substances into America. The drugs and violence they import are a threat to the homeland, which 
is why we are focused on ramping up counter-TCO activities. The Budget bolsters the capacity 
of ICE/HSI special agents to conduct transnational criminal investigations, and it provides 
funding to support law enforcement hiring and workload growth consistent with this mission, 
including $105 million for critical training, IT, facility support infrastructure, and wiretaps 
associated with ICE’s proposed increased staffing and workload. 
 
The Budget proposes essential funding to implement the President’s executive orders to intensify 
vetting of U.S.-bound travelers and individuals in our immigration system. Since the beginning 
of last year, DHS has undertaken historic efforts to improve every phase of the vetting process so 
that we can be more confident in knowing who is coming into our country—and more capable of 
identifying nefarious actors. This includes making applications more rigorous, deepening 
background checks, tightening travel and arrival screening, and enforcing foreign government 
information-sharing requirements. The Budget will facilitate the stand-up of the newly 
announced National Vetting Center (NVC), which will become a central U.S. Government hub 
for fusing intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security data to enhance the vetting 
process. A detailed implementation plan is currently under development to identify NVC 
capacity and operational needs that will inform future budget requests. 
 
Additionally, DHS is seeking to provide critical resources to the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) to 
better defend the nation against transnational threats and support the response to natural 
disasters. The USCG secures our maritime borders by operating up to more than 1,500 miles 
offshore to extend the Nation’s security and to enforce laws. During the 2017 hurricane season, 
the USCG, working alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was 
prepared and immediately responded to the needs of our citizens and partner nations. Their 
unique blend of statutory authorities combines civil law enforcement, response, and prevention 
with military service capabilities, resulting in an extremely agile force capable of responding to 
any significant event or emergency. 
 
The FY 2019 President’s Budget requests $1.9 billion for the recapitalization of USCG assets. 
This funding provides for a new Offshore Patrol Cutter, four Fast Response Cutters, and the 
Nation’s first new heavy Polar Icebreaker in more than 40 years, providing an advanced 
command, control and communications platform capable of operating in the harshest 
environments. It also provides for timely and necessary sensor and service-life extensions to 
aircraft and improvements to shore infrastructure. These are the investments we need to be 
making to defend our territory, and I hope the Committee will support our requests. 
 
We are also seeking important cybersecurity enhancements. This Committee knows that the 
dangers we face online are serious, and they emanate from hackers, TCOs, nation-states, and 
other nefarious actors. DHS is on the digital frontlines of this fight and is undertaking historic 
efforts to safeguard the Federal Government’s civilian information technology systems and to 
work with all levels of government, international partners, and business sectors to share 
cybersecurity information and build resilient systems. 
 
The President’s Budget would continue investments in cybersecurity initiatives that protect 
federal networks and address identified vulnerabilities. More than $644 million is requested for 
DHS’s Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation program and the National Cybersecurity 
Protection System program, commonly referred to as EINSTEIN, which provide network 
monitoring tools, intrusion prevention, intrusion detection, and analytical capabilities that 
strengthen the cybersecurity of federal civilian departments and agencies. 
 
The threat is real, and we know that a sophisticated adversary can put the foundations of our 
democracy at risk through cyberattacks, which is why our request for FY 2019 would also make 
sure DHS is positioned to counter foreign meddling by supporting state and local election 
officials in defending the integrity of election systems. The Budget also would provide $158 
million to secure the Nation’s interoperable emergency communications capabilities that enable 
first responders and government officials to continue to communicate in the event of natural and 
man-made disasters. 
 
Moreover, DHS is seeking to ramp up “soft target” security efforts. From terrorist attacks to 
school shootings, we have seen public areas continue to be struck by violence. Our National 
Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) is helping to lead the charge on soft target 
security. The President’s Budget would provide almost $12 million for the establishment of the 
Soft Target Security Program which would expand NPPD’s capabilities to reduce the risks to 
these locations through a mix of technology integration, targeted threat information sharing, 
training, and improved standards for security. This program will provide a more 
comprehensive, innovative, and coordinated approach to address threats to soft targets—
including schools, entertainment venues, major events, and public spaces. 
 
 
Our wider transportation system also faces persistent and emerging threats, as terrorists adapt 
their tactics to target airlines, airports, and other transportation hubs. The President’s Budget was 
built to confront these challenges. It would add 687 TSA screeners and 145 additional computed 
tomography systems in order to stay ahead of our enemies, especially by helping to better detect 
concealed explosives, threat devices, and suspicious passengers. This budget would also provide 
an increase of nearly $27 million for CBP’s National Targeting Center to improve our 
capabilities to identify high-risk individuals and cargo both entering and leaving the United 
States in the air, land, and sea environments. 
 
Similarly, we are seeing an evolution in the danger posed by chemical, biological, radiological, 
and nuclear agents. That is why in December I announced the establishment of a DHS 
Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD). I call on Congress to permanently 
authorize this Office and to ensure we have the authorities needed to protect Americans against 
such deadly agents. Already, CWMD has been at the forefront of driving the Department’s 
response to recent threat streams and incidents. The President’s Budget supports CWMD’s 
efforts to mitigate security vulnerabilities, and includes $75 million for the acquisition and 
deployment of nuclear, chemical, radiological, and biological systems to support operational 
customers, including enhanced Radiation Portal Monitors and other programs to support 
scanning of cargo entering the Nation. In addition, it includes $65 million for capability building, 
including outreach efforts necessary to ensure federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, and 
international partners are enabled to support the WMD detection mission. 
 
The President’s Budget recognizes that homeland security is central to economic security. It 
would provide funding to ensure DHS components are able to facilitate lawful trade and travel, 
mitigate threats, hold violators accountable, counter foreign economic aggression, and advance 
America’s economic interests. For instance, the Department is focused on maintaining a level 
playing field for the $2.4 trillion dollars of imports crossing our border each year, which is why 
the President’s Budget includes funding to enhance the Automated Commercial Environment 
(ACE) and to put more attention on high-risk imports while facilitating smaller, legitimate 
shipments more quickly. The request also includes funding for additional attorneys, trade 
specialists, and financial specialists to provide adequate support for trade facilitation and 
enforcement activities. 
 
The men and women of the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) also protect our Nation’s financial 
infrastructure, and the FY 2019 Budget supports the USSS in its use of advanced technologies 
and task force partnerships to enforce counterfeiting laws and to safeguard the payment and 
financial systems of the United States from financial and computer-based crimes. The agency 
also protects our highest elected officials, visiting foreign dignitaries, select Federal facilities, 
and major events. The request would allow for an additional 450 USSS agents, officers, and 
professional staff and would fund critical protective infrastructure and technology upgrades. 
 
Last year our country experienced one of the most costly and damaging seasons for natural 
disasters in recent history. DHS is committed to helping our communities in the wake of these 
catastrophic events, and FEMA will devote the resources and attention needed—in 
cooperation with state, local, tribal, and territorial governments across the country—to ensure 
we recover. The President’s Budget supports the DRF, which sustains FEMA’s response and 
recovery efforts and funds a variety of federal assistance programs that enable state and local 
governments to prevent, protect, respond, and recover from incidents of terrorism and other 
catastrophic events. The Budget also focuses on other efforts that will help create a “culture of 
preparedness” nationwide and make our nation more resilient to disasters. 
 
The 2019 President’s Budget is committed to ensuring that every American dollar is spent 
wisely, and DHS continues to identify efficiencies to meet this goal. The Budget funds the 
construction of a new headquarters building for FEMA at the St. Elizabeths campus, which will 
consolidate a wide range of DHS entities in a common location when complete. This will not 
only foster integrated decision making and collaboration, but it will provide for more efficient 
use of shared resources across the Department, while also reducing the Department’s rent costs. 
 
Ultimately, the President’s FY 2019 Budget request recognizes current fiscal realities, as well as 
the persistent and evolving dangers we face. We have outstanding men and women working at 
DHS committed to protecting our homeland and the American people. You have my 
commitment to work tirelessly to ensure that they are equipped and empowered to do their jobs. 
And I appreciate your support in doing so. 
 
Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today and for your continued support 
of DHS. I remain committed to working with Congress, and I look forward to forging a strong 
and productive relationship to secure our homeland. 
 
I am pleased to answer any questions. "

Statement of 
Honorable Lucian Niemeyer 
Assistant Secretary Of Defense 
(Energy, Installations and Environment) 
 
 
 
Before the Senate Committee on Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies 
Fiscal Year 2019 Department of Defense Budget Request for  
Energy, Installations and Environment 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
April 26, 2018 
Introduction 
 
Chairman Boozman, Ranking Member Schatz, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee: 
Thank you for the opportunity to present the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 budget request 
for the Department of Defense programs supporting energy, installations, and the environment.  
This is my first time appearing before you and I look forward to working with the committee to 
support the priorities of the Department and the quality of life for our military members and 
family members who are called to sacrifice so much for public service.  
 
First, thank you for your continued support for our mission.  We are grateful to Congress and the 
American people for the recently-enacted Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which lifts the caps so 
our military can be resourced at a funding level that begins to reverse the effects of sequestration.  
The Administration sent Congress a proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 budget request of $716 
billion for national security, $686 billion of which is for the Department of Defense.  We have a 
responsibility now to honor the trust of the American people by spending each defense dollar 
wisely to address our most urgent priorities to build a more lethal, resilient, and rapidly 
innovating Joint Force.  
 
In order to so, we need a timely appropriation in Fiscal Year 2019 to be fully effective.  While 
the process of Continuing Resolutions instead of spending bills provides Congress with 
additional negotiating time, the price is paid in stress on the Department through a shortened 
period to execute contracts for combat capabilities and readiness requirements.  Budgetary 
disruption and instability negatively impact the Department’s ability to work efficiently and 
modernize rapidly. 
 
Earlier this year, the President released a National Security Strategy which guided the 
development of a National Defense Strategy to clearly articulate the threats and challenges our 
Nation faces around the world.  The objectives of the Department are “to be prepared to defend 
the homeland, remain the preeminent military power in the world, ensure the balances of power 
remain in our favor, and advance an international order that is most conducive to our security 
and prosperity.”  Our FY 2019 budget priorities enable the Department to establish a foundation 
for rebuilding the U.S. military into a more capable, lethal, and ready Joint Force.  Each military 
service has a distinctive readiness recovery plan and the increases are targeted to advance these 
plans to improve readiness and increase lethality. 
 
The National Defense Strategy acknowledges that great-power competition has reemerged as the 
central challenge to U.S. security and prosperity, demanding prioritization and hard strategic 
choices.  “The future Joint Force will have a modern, flexible, and tailored nuclear deterrent; 
decisive, globally-capable conventional forces; and competency in irregular warfare.  The future 
force will be lethal and resilient in contested environments, disruptive to adversaries, and 
competent across the conflict spectrum.” 
 
The strategy confronts the stark reality that the homeland is no longer a sanctuary.  America is a 
target, whether from terrorists seeking to attack our citizens; malicious cyber activity against 
personal, commercial, or government infrastructure; or political and information subversion.  
New threats to commercial and military uses of space are emerging, while increasing digital 
1 
 
connectivity of all aspects of life, business, government, and military creates significant 
vulnerabilities.  During conflict, attacks against our critical defense, government, and economic 
infrastructure must be anticipated and deterred. 
 
The strategy stresses forward force maneuver, resilient posture, and agile logistics.  Investments 
over the next few years will prioritize ground, air, sea, and space forces that can deploy, survive, 
operate, maneuver, and regenerate in all domains while under attack.  Our investments must 
facilitate the transition from large, centralized, unhardened infrastructure to smaller, dispersed, 
resilient, adaptive basing that includes active and passive defenses. 
 
Finally, the strategy requires each of us in the Department to drive budget discipline and 
affordability.  Better management begins with effective financial stewardship.  As noted in the 
National Defense Strategy, “The Department will continue its plan to achieve full auditability of 
all its operations, improving its financial processes, systems, and tools to understand, manage, 
and improve cost.  We will continue to leverage the scale of our operations to drive greater 
efficiency in procurement of materiel and services while pursuing opportunities to consolidate 
and streamline contracts in areas such as logistics, information technology, and support 
services.  We will also continue efforts to reduce management overhead and the size of 
headquarters staff.  We will reduce or eliminate duplicative organizations and systems for 
managing human resources, finance, health services, travel, and supplies.  The Department will 
also work to reduce excess property and infrastructure, providing Congress with options for a 
Base Realignment and Closure.” 
 
Each mission within our energy, installations, and environmental portfolio is directly engaged in 
the successful execution of this strategy.  The DOD representatives before you today provide 
warfighter capabilities through over 585,000 facilities on more than 500 bases, posts, camps, 
stations, yards, and centers around the world, with a replacement cost exceeding $1 trillion, not 
including the cost of the 27 million acres of land that our installations occupy.  We execute the 
construction of facilities to provide our Combatant Commanders in partnership with our Allies 
with basing adaptability and deployment flexibility.  
 
Our warfighters need reliable energy to carry out their missions, whether they are out in the field 
or on base.  We spend over $12 billion annually on fuel and energy, not including investments to 
enhance the energy security of our critical facilities and assets in the Department.  We are also 
working with other agencies in the Administration to support the President’s goal to accelerate 
development of all energy sources in ways that are compatible with the preservation of military 
capabilities.  
 
Our warfighters need access to unencumbered land, water, and airspace to hone their readiness 
and lethality without compromising health and safety—we invest heavily in programs and 
achievements to secure access to ranges that support mission-essential activities.  We are also 
heavily engaged with other Federal agencies to provide our warfighters with larger, and more 
realistic ranges with less maneuver restrictions to better simulate battlefields and threats around 
the world. 
 
 
2 
 
The continued support of Congress, and in particular, this subcommittee, allow us to use the 
resources provided to enhance the agility, resilience, readiness, and lethality of our forces around 
the world. 
 
With a clear understanding of the Secretary’s intent, we have set forth the following objectives to 
guide our efforts to carry out the strategy and to confront our challenges posed by years of 
underfunded facility and infrastructure accounts.  
 
1.  We are using every program and funding source available to us to eliminate waste in 
DOD installations and infrastructure and maintain what we need; 
 
2.  We continue to advocate for adequate funding for installation and infrastructure accounts 
to meet mission requirements and to address risks to safety and readiness; 
 
3.  We are working with other Federal agencies, States, and communities to protect 
installations and ranges from incompatible development and to enhance the combat 
credibility of our Nation’s test and training ranges; 
 
4.  We are implementing programs to ensure combat capability, missions, and resiliency by 
enhancing the energy security of our forces and assets; 
 
5.  We are exploring new opportunities for third party partnerships and engaging with 
industry to determine best practices and innovative solutions for our current challenges; 
 
6.  We are working with the military engineering and contracting community to develop 
smarter contracts, and manage contracts smartly; 
 
7.  We continue to provide for the safety and welfare of our people and resources through 
unparalleled environmental stewardship and occupational safety programs; 
 
8.  And last, but definitely not least, we are enhancing our collaboration with the hundreds of 
dedicated defense communities around the Nation supporting our bases and providing for 
the quality of life for our troops and their families. 
 
We have a number of high priority issues to review today, including the ongoing improvement 
and recapitalization of DOD facilities, access to training lands, protecting the health of our force, 
and ensuring energy resiliency for both our expeditionary forces and installations.  
  
Fiscal Year 2019 Budget Request – Military Construction and Family Housing 
 
The President's FY 2019 budget requests $10.5 billion for the Military Construction (MILCON) 
and Family Housing Appropriation – an increase of approximately $700 million from the FY 
2018 base budget request, inclusive of FY 2018 budget amendments to support the Missile 
Defense Agency and hurricane recovery requests.  This increase supports the Secretary of 
Defense’s guidance.  In addition to construction required to bed down new or changing missions, 
3 
 
this funding will also be used to restore and modernize enduring facilities, acquire new facilities 
where needed, and eliminate those that are excess or obsolete. 
 
While the FY 2019 request makes significant progress in recapitalizing facilities in poor and 
failing condition, the funding will not in one fiscal year fully reverse the impacts of six years of 
sequestration.  Many of our facilities have degraded significantly from reduced investments in 
Military Construction, Facilities Sustainment and Restoration and Modernization.  The 
Department currently has an unfunded backlog of deferred maintenance and repair (M&R) work 
exceeding $116 billion, and many of our facilities will require significant investment in the 
future.  The stark reality is that it may be too costly to buy ourselves out of this backlog.  The 
Department must ensure that its infrastructure is ideally sized to increase the lethality of U.S. 
forces while minimizing the cost of maintaining unneeded capacity, which otherwise diverts 
resources from critical readiness and modernization requirements.  
 
We are requesting $8.9 billion for military construction (excluding Overseas Contingency 
Operations funding) across the Services and defense agencies, which is the substantially higher 
than our previous budget submission.  This represents a five percent increase from our FY 2018 
request, inclusive of budget amendment requests for a Missile Defense missile field expansion at 
Fort Greely, AK, and repairs related to the 2017 hurricane season.  This request addresses 
requirements for construction at enduring installations stateside and overseas, and for specific 
programs such as the NATO Security Investment Program and the Energy Resilience and 
Conservation Investment Program.  In addition, we are targeting MILCON funds in key areas to 
support the national defense strategy.  
 
1.  Delivery of power projection platforms: In support of the Secretary of Defense’s 
guidance that increased DOD funding will improve readiness and increase warfighter 
lethality, the DOD Components applied more than 66 percent of the MILCON budget 
request to construct operational/training facilities ($3.5 billion) and 
maintenance/production facilities ($1.4 billion).   
 
2.  Combatant Command Priorities: In support of the Secretary’s priority to enhance our 
relationship with our Allies while providing adaptive basing opportunities for our 
warfighters, more than $1.1 billion is included in the President’s Budget request ($291.1 
million in the base and $828.4 million in the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) 
request) to support Combatant Command priorities.  Within the OCO request, $700 
million is for MILCON projects supporting the European Deterrence Initiative to 
improve infrastructure and facilities throughout the European theater to provide our 
allies, partners, and potential adversaries a clear indication of the United States’ long-
term commitment to Europe.  The improvements support military readiness in the region 
and improve theater Joint Reception, Staging, Onward Movement, and Integration 
capabilities.  
  
3.  Homeland Defense: The FY 2019 budget request includes $182 million to support missile 
defense of the homeland, including $174 million for the second phase of the Long Range 
Discriminating Radar System Complex at Clear AFS, Alaska, and $8 million for the 
expansion of Missile Field #1 to support two additional ground based interceptors at Fort 
4 
 
Greely, Alaska.  We also have dedicated the bulk of our $150 million Energy Resiliency 
and Conservation Improvement program (ERCIP) for FY 2019 to projects that will 
enhance the reliable delivery of power to mission facilities.  We believe this program is a 
critical tool to quickly respond to emerging energy security requirements and request the 
continued support by the committees for full funding of this account.  
 
The Department is committed to protecting the quality of life for military personnel and their 
families by ensuring access to suitable, affordable Family and Unaccompanied Housing.  The 
environment in which our forces and their families live has an impact on their ability to do their 
job, and on the Department's ability to recruit and retain.  Quality of life – to include the physical 
condition of the facilities in which our service members and their families live and work and a 
safe, healthy environment around and within those facilities – is also critical to support personnel 
readiness for new and current missions and strategic initiatives worldwide.  
 
While the Department has privatized 99 percent (more than 200,000 units) of our family housing 
in the United States, our FY 2019 Family Housing budget request includes $514 million to fund 
family housing construction at locations where privatization is not feasible or not authorized 
overseas.  In addition, our FY 2019 budget request includes $1.1 billion for operation and 
maintenance of government-owned and leased family housing worldwide, to include providing 
housing referral services to assist military members with their housing needs.  This O&M budget 
request supports more than 34,000 government-owned family housing units, most of which are on 
enduring bases in overseas locations, as well as more than 7,500 government-leased family 
housing units where government-owned or privatized housing is unavailable.  The requested 
funding will ensure that U.S. military personnel and their families continue to have suitable 
housing choices. 
  
The Department also continues to modernize Unaccompanied Personnel Housing to improve 
privacy and provide greater amenities.  The FY 2019 President’s Budget request includes $245.8 
million for 8 construction and renovation projects, providing more than 1,690 new or replacement 
bed spaces that will improve living conditions for trainees and unaccompanied personnel.   
 
Our request also includes $1.7 million to support administration of the Military Housing 
Privatization Initiative (MHPI) program as prescribed by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.  
This includes monitoring MHPI programmatic goals and performance, and risk associated with 
Federal credit assistance provided for MHPI projects (e.g., government direct loans and limited 
loan guarantees).  The Department continues to work with our MHPI project owners to help 
ensure the long-term viability of individual projects and the program as a whole.  We are 
continually assessing the impact that changes to the Basic Allowance for Housing may have on 
project revenue, which covers project operating and maintenance expenses, funds debt payments, 
and finances the future housing revitalization and recapitalization necessary to provide continued 
high quality housing for military families and to ensure these projects remain viable throughout 
their 40-50 year lifespans.

Special Considerations  
 
Cost of labor in a post-storm bid climate and impact on 2018 and 2019 execution 
The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was one of the most destructive hurricane seasons on record, 
with over $1 billion in damage in to DOD facilities.  The private sector rebuilding will take years 
and many billions of dollars while consuming a large portion of the U.S. construction market.  
As such, the Department’s FY 2019 MILCON budget request takes into account the impact on 
construction costs of a high demand for specialty craftsmen and material prices over the near-
term.  While the ongoing recovery from last summer’s hurricane damage has tightened 
construction markets and driven up construction prices in the most impacted areas, the 
Department judges the impacts will last through October 2018, barring a repeat of last summer.  
As such, we plan on using prior-year bid savings from other MILCON projects to absorb 
potential bid spikes in FY 2018 in order to avoid delays in the award of critical warfighting 
requirements.  We would appreciate a discussion with the committees prior to a decision to 
rescind funds from prior-year MILCON accounts which could threaten our ability to award 
FY2018 priority projects.  We do not anticipate needing to adjust FY 2019 MILCON project cost 
estimates in the affected areas to reflect spikes in construction prices.    
 
Actions planned to mitigate contract cost increases and time delays 
We have undertaken a proactive assessment of recent challenges in MILCON project delivery 
and program management to improve our performance delivering MILCON projects on schedule 
and within budget.  The Department is implementing reforms in a number of key areas, to 
include: improving identification of project requirements; enhancing collaboration between 
resource sponsors, end users, and construction agents to ensure projects meet mission 
requirements within budget constraints; selecting the best engineering and acquisition strategy to 
cost-effectively meet mission requirements; identifying risk mitigation measures before cost or 
schedule changes adversely impact the mission; and increasing awareness and accountability at 
all levels of management and performance as problems arise. The Department is also consulting 
with our industry partners to identify commercial best practices to lower costs, save time, 
measure performance differently, and improve project quality in support of the warfighter. 
 
Further challenges to incremental funding of military construction projects 
The Administration and Congress have competing interests on an incremental funding policy for 
large MILCON projects.  Congressional decisions to reallocate incremental appropriations for a 
MILCON project results in the need for DOD to defer priorities late in the budgeting cycle in 
subsequent years in order to include remaining increments in the budget request.  Further 
Congressional incrementation may result in delays to project delivery of critical warfighter 
requirements. 
 
Facilities Sustainment and Recapitalization 
 
In addition to MILCON, the Department invests significant funds to maintain and repair our 
existing facilities.  Sustainment funding represents the Department’s single most important 
investment in preserving the condition of its facilities.  It includes regularly scheduled 
maintenance and repair or replacement of facility components—the periodic, predictable 
investments that should be made across the service life of a facility to slow its deterioration, save 
6 
 
resources over the long term, maintain safety, optimize facility performance across its lifecycle, 
and help improve the productivity and quality of life of our personnel.  
 
These activities have endured funding constraints under the Budget Control Act, forcing Defense 
Components to accept significant risk in facilities sustainment and recapitalization.  Recognizing 
this, the Military Departments increased Facility Sustainment commitments in the FY 2019 
budget request of $9.1 billion, a 6.3 percent funding increase compared to the Department’s FY 
2018 budget request. 
 
In addition, Restoration and Modernization funding is used to perform total facility renovations 
and critical repairs to ensure the facility can support assigned missions.  Our FY 2019 budget 
request includes $2.8 billion of O&M funding for recapitalization.  The combined facility 
sustainment and recapitalization funding of $11.9 billion, a slight decrease the FY 2018 request, 
still reflects an acceptance of significant risk in DOD facilities.   
   
As a result of limited investments in previous budgets for facilities sustainment and 
recapitalization, 23 percent of the Department’s facility inventory is in “poor” condition [Facility 
Condition Index (FCI) between 60 and 79 percent] and another 9 percent is in “failing” condition 
(FCI below 60 percent) based on recent facility condition assessment data.  This will ultimately 
result in DOD facing larger bills in the out-years to restore or replace facilities that deteriorate 
prematurely.   
 
Previous budgets also have limited investment for targeted demolition to eliminate obsolete, 
inefficient, and underutilized support infrastructure.  Without a new Base Realignment and 
Closure round, DOD has largely been forced to rely on routine demolition or renovation of 
buildings as part of MILCON projects in order to right size its facility inventory.  The 
Department dedicated some of its additional FY 2019 resources to demolish more unneeded 
facilities.  The FY 2019 budget request includes $442 million of O&M funding specifically for 
demolition or conversion of existing facilities and $65.4 million for MILCON funding to support 
demolition of assets in conjunction with new construction.  In total, almost 30 million square feet 
of building space will be removed or replaced.   
 
Environmental and Safety Programs 
 
Restoring military readiness requires that we maintain access to training lands and protect the 
health of our force.  The Department’s environmental budget accomplishes these objectives 
through activities ranging from managing critical habitat and avoiding training restrictions to 
addressing drinking water health advisories and making the best use of limited cleanup dollars.  
At the same time, we manage a $27 billion (and growing) environmental liability, the second 
largest DOD liability, while sustaining our reputation as the Nation’s premier steward of natural 
resources and cultural assets.  The President’s FY 2019 Budget requests $3.4 billion for 
environmental programs, which is comparable to the FY 2018 request, to continue our efforts in 
these areas. 
 
We are requesting $1.3 billion to continue cleanup efforts at the remaining Installation 
Restoration Program (IRP – focused on cleanup of hazardous substances, pollutants, and 
7 
 
contaminants) and Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP – focused on the removal of 
unexploded ordnance and discarded munitions) sites.  This includes $1.1 billion for 
“Environmental Restoration,” which encompasses active installations and Formerly Used 
Defense Sites (FUDS – sites that DoD transferred to other Federal agencies, States, local 
governments, or private landowners before October 17, 1986).  The remaining $245 million is 
for “BRAC Environmental.” 
  
Our focus remains on continuous improvement in the restoration program: minimizing overhead, 
adopting new technologies to reduce cost and accelerate cleanup, and refining and standardizing 
our cost estimating.  We have improved our relationships with State regulators through increased 
dialogue, which reduces the number of formal disputes over cleanup levels and allows us to 
implement cleanup activities in a timelier manner.  All of these initiatives help ensure that we 
make the best use of our available resources to complete cleanup. 
 
Table 5: Progress Towards Cleanup Goals 
Goal: Achieve Response Complete at 90% and 95% of Active and BRAC IRP and MMRP 
sites, and FUDS IRP sites, by FY 2018 and FY 2021, respectively 
 
Status as of the end  Projected status at  Projected status at

DLA  86%  88%  96% 
FUDS  84%  86%  93% 
Total  86%  88%  93% 
 
By the end of 2017, the Department, in cooperation with State agencies and the Environmental 
Protection Agency, completed cleanup activities at 86 percent of Active and BRAC IRP and 
MMRP sites, and FUDS IRP sites, and is now monitoring the results.  During FY 2017 alone, the 
Department completed cleanup at over 500 sites.  Of the roughly 39,800 restoration sites, almost 
33,200 are now in monitoring status or have completed cleanup. 
 
In addition, DOD has made significant progress in the cleanup of our FUDS sites, completing 84 
percent of the IRP sites.  Despite this progress, 1,700 of the over 5,100 FUDS sites still need to 
be addressed, many of which are MMRP sites.  The Department is evaluating opportunities, such 
as partnering with landowners at our FUDS sites, to expedite cleanup and make these lands 
available for development sooner. 
 
While DOD is committed to cleaning up all the remaining sites in a timely manner, many of 
these sites present complex challenges.  New and changing standards require DOD to reprioritize 
or reopen previous remediation decisions which delays progress.  Additionally, some sites have 
no feasible solution to clean up the contamination, and as a result, the Department is making 
significant investments in environmental technology to identify new potential remediation 
methods. 
 
 
8 
 
Environmental Technology 
A key part of DOD’s approach to meeting its environmental obligations and improving its 
performance is the pursuit of advances in science and technology.  The Department has a long 
record of success developing innovative environmental technologies and quickly transferring 
them from the laboratory to actual use on remediation sites, installations, ranges, depots, and 
other industrial facilities.  These same technologies are also now widely used at non-Defense 
sites helping the nation as a whole. 
 
While the FY 2019 budget request for Environmental Technology overall is $172 million, our 
core efforts are conducted and coordinated through two key programs – the Strategic 
Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP – focused on basic and applied 
research) and the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP – focused 
on validating more mature technologies to transition them to widespread use).  The FY 2019 
budget request includes $77 million for SERDP and $24 million for ESTCP for environmental 
technology demonstrations, with an additional $16 million requested specifically for energy 
technology demonstrations.  
 
These programs have already achieved demonstrable results and have the potential to increase 
training land availability by developing more effective management strategies for installation 
managers, to reduce costs by developing new ways of treating groundwater contamination, and 
to reduce the life-cycle costs of multiple weapons systems.  In the area of Environmental 
Restoration, we are launching an aggressive initiative to develop more cost-effective treatment 
options for other newly-identified contaminants in addition to addressing Perflurooctane 
Sulfonate (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA).  In the critical area of installation energy, 
we are focused on proving technology and solutions that cost-effectively improve the energy 
security of our installations and that protect our energy assets and facilities from cyber attacks. 
 
Environmental Conservation and Compatible Development 
The Department continues to preserve access to the land, water, and airspace needed to support 
our mission.  As training, testing, and operational activities expand and new weapons systems 
are introduced, access and use of ranges becomes even more important.  The FY 2018 budget 
request for Conservation is $419 million.  The Department will invest these funds to maximize 
our flexibility to use lands for military purposes, as well as addressing incompatible land uses 
beyond our fence lines. 
 
The Department’s lands and waters are vital to readiness, but also support a diverse array of fish 
and wildlife species, including over 400 that are federally protected under the Endangered 
Species Act (ESA).  Managing for healthy and resilient natural landscapes provides the 
conditions necessary for mission-essential activities, such as reducing fire risks, avoiding 
wildlife conflicts, and improving range and training area conditions. 
 
Species endangerment and habitat degradation can and does have negative impacts on the 
mission through regulatory protections.  In recent years, there has also been a marked increase in 
the number species being petitioned and evaluated for listing under the ESA.  We have initiated a 
TIGER TEAM with the Department of the Interior to develop proactive, collaborative 
conservation initiatives to help prevent additional species of concern to the Department from 
9 
 
being listed under the ESA, and implementing conservation actions to facilitate species recovery 
and de-listing.  As a result of our management, research, and coordination efforts, the 
Department has regained access to important training lands.  For example, our continued 
cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and other partners for the 
conservation of the black-capped vireo at Fort Hood has significantly reduced training 
restrictions on 73,000 acres, and the species is currently being evaluated for de-listing.  
Similarly, working with partners in the USFWS and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in 
California, the US Marine Corps translocated over 1,000 endangered desert tortoises from newly 
withdrawn lands at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), Twentynine Palms.  
This translocation opened over 160,000 acres for training, filling a critical need to support large-
scale Marine Expeditionary Battalion (MEB) exercises.  Ongoing management and monitoring 
efforts will help sustain military readiness. 
 
We have also realized great success and mission benefits from the unique regulatory provisions 
within the ESA that exclude military lands from critical habitat designations.  Building on this 
success, we will continue to work with our partners at the USFWS and National Marine Fisheries 
Service, as well as other Federal, State, and non-governmental partners, to develop new and 
innovative regulatory approaches that streamline processes and provide greater mission 
flexibility.  We will also be working to develop more landscape-scale initiatives to better 
capitalize on both our on-installation conservation programs and our off-installation conservation 
partnerships through the Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) Program. 
 
Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Program 
REPI investments protect training, testing, and operational assets of the Department.  As 
training, testing, and operational activities increase and new weapons systems are introduced, the 
ability to work with Federal, State, local and private partners to promote compatible 
development, relieve regulatory restrictions, and leverage resources that sustain critical military 
capabilities, becomes even more important.  Investing in and taking advantage of current 
opportunities for innovative collaboration is paramount to securing the operational viability of 
local installations and ranges.  REPI is able to directly leverage the Department's investments at 
approximately one-to-one with those of our partners, effectively ensuring compatible land uses 
around our installations for half the price.  Through REPI’s partnering efforts, we can continue to 
support the warfighter, provide value to the taxpayer, and enhance military readiness and 
capabilities. 
 
To enable DOD to sustain its national defense mission and to ensure military installations do not 
become refuges of last resort for threatened, endangered, or at-risk species, the Department has 
developed an approach that supports land protection beyond installation boundaries.  Under this 
approach, DOD engages with other governmental and non-governmental partners who work with 
private landowners, to develop initiatives and agreements for protecting properties for the 
purposes of avoiding or mitigating regulatory restrictions on training, testing, and operations on 
DOD lands.  These efforts ease the on-installation species management burden and reduce the 
possibility of restricted activities, ultimately providing more flexibility for commanders to 
execute their missions. 
 
10 
 
A recent, innovative example of this approach is the Department’s Gopher Tortoise Conservation 
Crediting Strategy, which the Department, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and three 
State agencies finalized in March of 2017.  This Strategy seeks to address the conservation of the 
gopher tortoise, a candidate species for protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), 
thereby providing the regulatory predictability that commanders require to effectively operate at 
installations and ranges throughout the southeast.  Through the 2018 REPI Challenge, a 
competitive funding process that seeks to cultivate innovative approaches to sustaining military 
capabilities, the Department seeks to fund similar species crediting strategies that will help 
reduce existing or future regulatory restrictions to testing, training, and operational activities. 
 
Within the $424 million for Conservation, $75 million is directed to the REPI Program.  The 
REPI Program is a cost-effective tool to protect the nation’s existing training, testing, and 
operational capabilities at a time of decreasing resources.  In the last 15 years, REPI partnerships 
have protected more than 510,000 acres of land around 93 installations in 31 States.  In addition 
to the tangible benefits of preserving DOD’s existing training, testing, and operational assets, 
these efforts have resulted in significant contributions to the economic health and recreational 
opportunities for local communities.   
 
In addition, DOD, along with the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture, continues to 
advance the Sentinel Landscapes Partnership to protect large landscapes where conservation, 
working lands, and national defense interests converge – places defined as Sentinel Landscapes.  
Established in 2013, the Sentinel Landscapes Partnership further strengthens interagency 
coordination and provides taxpayers with the greatest leverage of their funds by aligning Federal 
programs to advance the mutually-beneficial goals of each agency.  
 
Since the initiation of the Partnership, agencies from the three Departments have designated 
seven locations as Sentinel Landscapes.  Some of the military’s most important installations 
anchor these Landscapes: Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington; Fort Huachuca in Arizona; 
Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River and the Atlantic Test Ranges in Maryland (Middle 
Chesapeake Sentinel Landscape); Avon Park Air Force Range in Florida; Camp Ripley in 
Minnesota; and two consortia of installations in Eastern North Carolina and Georgia.  
Partnerships at each of these locations are collaborating to preserve, enhance, and protect habitat 
and vital working lands near military installations in order to reduce, prevent, or eliminate 
military test, training, and operational restrictions due to incompatible development.  At Joint 
Base Lewis-McChord, Fort Huachuca, and Middle Chesapeake Sentinel Landscapes combined, 
partners have invested more than $86 million between Fiscal Years 2013 and 2016 to advance 
each location’s specific military mission and resource conservation goals.  Over $17 million of 
the total investment during this period has come from State and local governments, whose 
support for the mission of the Partnership has helped to ensure its success. 
 
In addition to investments made in these areas, partners at each of the Sentinel Landscapes are 
working collaboratively on innovative approaches to better leverage existing efforts to preserve 
working lands and promote compatible development.  In the Middle Chesapeake and Avon Park 
Air Force Range Sentinel Landscapes, partners are working to improve efforts to match REPI 
funds with funding from the other Departments by aligning or merging agency requirements for 
the acquisition and monitoring of easements and land interests.  This unprecedented level of 
11 
 
interagency cooperation will enable the most efficient use of taxpayer funding to protect military 
capabilities and sustain readiness. 
 
Department of Defense Energy Programs 
 
Unlike the Department’s MILCON and Environmental Remediation programs, where the budget 
request includes specific line items, our energy programs are subsumed across other accounts, 
yet are critical to our support for military readiness, resiliency, and agility.  
 
Operational Energy - “Unleash us from the tether of fuel” 
 
Operational energy is the energy required for training, moving, and sustaining military forces 
and weapons platforms for military operations.  While energy is an essential component of our 
warfighting capability, longer operating distances, remote and austere geography, and anti-
access/area denial threats are challenging the Department’s ability to assure the delivery of fuel.  
As the ability to deliver energy is placed at risk, so too is the Department’s ability to deploy and 
sustain forces around the globe.  
 
Based on his experience in Iraq, then Lt Gen James Mattis, Director of Marine Corps Combat 
Development Command, directed researchers in 2005 to identify technological and operational 
improvements that would “unleash us from the tether of fuel.”  The operational energy 
investments in the FY 2019 budget request are focused on reducing that “tether” and increasing 
the capability of our forces on land, air, and sea. 
 
The FY 2019 President’s Budget supports a broad set of investments to ensure lethality in 
contested environments through resilient and agile logistics.  The Department is investing over 
$2.8 billion to upgrade and procure new equipment, improve propulsion, adapt plans, concepts, 
and wargames to account for increasing risks to logistics and sustainment, and enhance how the 
Department considers energy in developing new capabilities.  As the Department responds to 
changing threats in Europe, the Indo-Pacific, and the Middle East, these initiatives are increasing 
capability and decreasing risks for warfighters deployed around the globe.  
 
Significant initiatives include: 
     
  Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF): The Department is requesting 
$40.6 million in RDT&E funding to support operational energy research programs that 
improve military effectiveness.  Ongoing initiatives include efforts to improve the fuel 
economy of our tactical vehicle fleets, increase the energy performance of unmanned systems, 
enhance power and thermal management for high pulse power weapons, and wirelessly 
transmitting energy in the far field.  Our new starts this year include assessments of 
operational energy science and technology gaps in meeting warfighter requirements over the 
near-, mid-, and far-term. 
  Operational Risk in Wargames: To better plan for the impact of operational energy in 
contingencies, we are actively engaged in supporting war gaming and exercises conducted by 
the Department.  Recently, my office participated the Air Force’s Global Engagement 
wargame, the Army’s Deep Futures 17 wargame, as well as the U.S. Pacific Command 
12 
 
Logistics Wargame.  Operational Energy staff continuously participate in the planning and 
execution of the games, as well as the assessment of game results.  With the integration of 
realistic constraints to logistics capacity and threats to our fuel storage and distribution, our 
efforts will improve Department decision-making in operation plans, concept and capability 
development, and program investments. 
  Direct Support to the Warfighter: In coordination with the Combatant Commands and the 
Military Services, my office works closely with the warfighter to enhance lethality and 
readiness.  We invested $4 million in 2017 to adapt Service training and education programs 
in each of the Services to increase operational reach and readiness.  We have developed a 
repository to capture operational energy lessons learned and are using the information we 
have gleaned to influence warfighters on the effects of their energy decisions on risk, reach, 
and the readiness of the force.  Finally, my team works with AFRICOM, EUCOM, and 
CENTCOM to decrease risk to operations by leading power assessments resulting in 
improved power reliability and reduced fuel consumption, which has direct effects on the 
reduction of vulnerable logistics convoys while providing more operational capability to 
commanders on the ground. 
        
Installation Energy 
 
Installation energy is the energy used to power our 500 plus permanent installations here in the 
U.S and overseas, including the fuel used in our 160,000 non-tactical fleet vehicles.  Our 
installation energy bill remains our single largest base operating cost.  In FY 2017, we spent $3.5 
billion to heat, cool, and provide electricity to our facilities.  To reduce this cost, the Department 
is pursuing energy efficiencies through building improvements, new construction, and third party 
financed investments. 
 
The Department of Defense has identified a top priority to ensure that our military capabilities 
and our ability to protect our Nation’s interests are assured through the delivery of reliable and 
resilient power.  Given recent federal reports on the vulnerability of our national commercial 
electrical grid to emerging threats, we have reviewed the scope of our efforts to concentrate 
resources on projects which will enhance the resilience of our defense critical and task critical 
assets.  These efforts will include the continued development of distributed energy sources which 
can be used to power critical missions regardless of the condition of the commercial grid. 
 
The Department’s FY 2019 budget request includes approximately $726 million for investments 
in energy resilience and energy conservation, most of which are directed to existing buildings.  
This includes $576 million in the Military Components’ Operations and Maintenance accounts 
for sustainment and recapitalization projects, which generally involve retrofits to install 
improved lighting, high-efficiency HVAC systems, double-pane windows, energy management 
control systems, and new roofs.  The remainder ($150 million) is for the Energy Resilience and 
Conservation Investment Program (ERCIP), a MILCON account which funds projects that 
improve energy resilience and security, save energy and water, reduce DOD’s energy costs, and 
most importantly, contribute to mission assurance.  
 
 
 
13 
 
Energy Resilience and Conservation Investment Program  
Secure access to energy resources on our installations is critical to the execution of the DOD 
mission.  The interdependent and vulnerable nature of existing electric power grids supporting 
our installations places risk on our mission capabilities and installation security as well as our 
power projection ability and support to global operations.   
 
ERCIP is one of the Department’s key tools to enable more robust energy security.  DOD is 
requesting $150 million for this program for FY 2019, including $113 million for energy 
resilience projects and $37 million for energy conservation projects.  These projects include two 
microgrid projects, one at Schriever AFB, CO and one at Camp Williams, UT.  In addition, the 
portfolio includes a project at Fort Sill, OK, to construct a new underground electric service 
connection between an existing substation and a newly constructed substation.  This project will 
support critical missions of our Field and Air Defense Artillery Brigades by eliminating the 
single point of failure at Fort Sill and providing complete redundancy to critical missions in the 
event of a power disruption caused by a natural disaster, physical attack, or other event. 
 
These resilience projects have a combined Savings to Investment Ratio (SIR) of 2.26.  In other 
words, every dollar we invest in ERCIP, generates more than two dollars in savings, 
demonstrating that, in most cases, energy resilience does not have to come at a premium price. 
 
Energy Resilience Planning and Facilities Energy Management 
In addition to investing in energy resilience projects, the Department is committed to real-world 
scenario-based planning, including using the results of the North American Reliability 
Corporation (NERC)-sponsored GridEx and our installation reliability exercises to drive more 
sophisticated internal testing and investment for resilient infrastructure.  This improves our 
installations’ security posture, increases our planning effectiveness, and ensures our ability to 
continue critical missions in the face of grid power disruptions that could occur due to weather 
events and/or direct physical or cyber attack.  We are also working with the Departments of 
Energy and Homeland Security to pinpoint the energy needs of critical defense assets and 
national infrastructure in order to maximize the use of reliable electricity delivered through our 
national power administrations.  
 
Leveraging strong energy sector relationships of the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory 
Council, DOD is engaging with industry and Federal interagency stakeholders to identify 
opportunities to enhance the Department’s mission assurance through outside-the-fence 
solutions.  Inside the installation fence, DOD is actively improving data sharing between mission 
operators and installation owners to use all available technologies that produce energy resilience 
solutions prioritized by mission, informed by metrics, and validated by results.  Furthermore, the 
Department is working with the Department of Energy to support the early-stage research and 
development of advanced reactor technologies, including small modular reactors and very small 
modular reactors.  DOD envisions potential future use for very small reactors at remote operating 
bases and independent strategic sites where an assured source of power aside from the 
commercial power grid is critical for the delivery of national security missions and capabilities. 
 
Energy resilience includes cybersecurity of Facility-Related Control Systems (FRCS).  FRCS 
supporting Defense Critical Infrastructure (DCI) are essential to perform warfighting 
14 
 
capabilities, execute critical missions, and project power; therefore they are actively threatened 
by adversaries and are highly vulnerable to cyber security attacks and failures.  Malware such as 
Stuxnet, BlackEnergy, and Crashoverride specifically targeted FRCS and the Ukraine electric 
grid attack demonstrated the capability to cut power to mission-critical facilities.  Risk to 
missions increase as more devices are connected to networks without appropriate security 
protections, and poor cyber hygiene persists by system operators without cybersecurity skills.  
To build a FRCS defense posture, the Department recently began developing FRCS 
cybersecurity plans to account for the capabilities and resources required to implement cyber 
security controls on its highest prioritized assets and systems.  We will continue to work with the 
Department’s Chief Information Officer and Principal Cyber Advisor toward solutions and 
resources ensuring FRCS are defensible, survivable, and resilient to operate and sustain critical 
functions in a cyber-contested environment. 
 
The Military Departments are continuing to implement updated energy resilience policies, which 
requires plans for energy disruptions and the capability to ensure available, reliable, high-quality, 
and cyber secure power to continuously accomplish our missions from our installations and 
facilities.  This includes prioritizing installation missions, conducting assessments, and planning 
and programming energy projects that reduce mission risk by improving energy resilience and 
security.  My office also issued an Energy Resilience: Operations, Maintenance and Testing 
Strategy and Implementation Guide last year to provide installation commanders, mission 
operators, and energy managers procedures to ensure that energy generation systems, 
infrastructure, equipment, and fuel are available and reliable to support critical mission 
operations on military installations.  We will be releasing further guidance this year that enables 
the Department to identify and align critical mission operations with critical energy requirements 
and effectively plan outage scenarios, which directly translates energy resilience metrics into 
tangible improvements in power and fuel resiliency for mission assurance. 
 
The Department’s energy efficiency efforts not only contribute to energy resilience by reducing 
critical loads, but also by lowering our base operating costs, which frees up funds for the 
warfighter.  Since FY 2005, the Department has continued to reduce facility energy usage, 
freeing up approximately $5.4 billion for higher priorities.  To further improve facilities energy 
management, my office issued a policy to require the Military Departments to develop 
Installation Energy Plans (IEP) by the end of FY 2019.  These plans directly enable installations 
to plan and carry out investments to enhance mission assurance for critical facilities. 
 
Smart Financing to Promote Energy Resilience 
The Department has broad alternative financing authorities that can be leveraged to implement 
installation energy initiatives that assist in improving energy resilience and mission assurance at 
our installations at lower cost to the taxpayer.  These authorities allow us to use performance-
based contracts, power purchase agreements, enhanced use leases, and utilities privatization, 
among others.  Using Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) and Utility Energy 
Service Contracts (UESCs), private energy firms or utility companies make energy upgrades at 
our installations and are paid back over time using utility bill savings.  Since December 2011, the 
Department has awarded $2.6 billion in performance-based contracts, which are expected to save 
DOD over $4 billion across the contract terms, which are then used to pay for energy 
improvement. 
15 
 
 
Another way the Department leverages its financing authorities is non-Federal financing for 
large-scale distributed energy projects.  This minimizes DOD’s capital investment by leveraging 
smarter contracts that incentivize industry to fund resilient infrastructure improvements.  When 
the business case supports it, the Department is pursuing distributed energy projects with micro-
grid-ready applications that enable the provision of continuous power in the event of a 
disruption.  For example, the Army leased land to Hawaiian Electric Company to construct, own 
and operate an on-site 50 megawatt (MW) multi-fuel/biofuel generation plant at Schofield 
Barracks, Hawaii.  The on-site generation system will enhance the resilience of the Oahu 
electrical grid and can provide Schofield Barracks, Field Station Kunia, and Wheeler Army Air 
Field with one hundred percent of their electrical power needs in the event of a power grid 
disruption.  Additionally, at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, the Navy signed an 
enhanced-use lease with a developer to construct an on-site solar plus battery energy storage 
system that includes infrastructure and contractual rights that allow the Navy to greatly improve 
power quality and reduce costs during normal operations.  During a power disruption, this 
project will operate as a micro-grid to provide a reliable and continuous source of backup power, 
directly reducing risk to our mission. 
 
To maximize opportunities for these types of smart contracts, the Department is standardizing 
project information and streamlining processes to spur investment by the financial services 
industry.  DOD is initiating a study to accelerate adoption of energy resilience projects through a 
shared risk rating, which incentivizes third parties to seek opportunities that support DOD 
mission, retains the Department’s control over its assets and operations, and improves facility 
contract execution.  This will enable low-cost, high-value contracts that make prudent use of 
resources and ensure our military’s capability, lethality, and readiness. 
 
High Interest Programs Supporting the National Defense Strategy 
 
Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 
 
As stated in the National Defense Strategy, the Department is working to reduce excess property 
and infrastructure.  To achieve greater performance and affordability, we must ensure that our 
basing infrastructure is ideally sized to increase the lethality of our forces while minimizing the 
cost of maintaining unneeded capacity, which diverts resources from critical readiness and 
modernization requirements.  These efforts will be enhanced by a comprehensive enterprise 
review of how and where we base new forces and capabilities in support of the National Defense 
Strategy.  Emerging technologies such as hypersonic systems, autonomous vehicles, and cyber 
forces may require new basing concepts.  Bases may also need to be assessed in order to 
optimize the training and deployment of directed energy programs, electronic warfare, and 
artificial intelligence systems.  In lieu of another request for legislation in FY 2019 to authorize 
an additional Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round, we will review our facilities, to 
include facility usage optimization review to ensure we have a better accounting of excess 
infrastructure.  We also have proposed for FY 2019 increased efforts to demolish unneeded or 
obsolete facilities over the course of this year.  Our collective efforts will allow us to provide 
Congress with fair, objective, and transparent options for future base realignments and closures, 
which maximize Department resources while also addressing any outstanding Congressional 
16 
 
concerns. 
 
Business Operations Reforms 
 
In the weeks and months ahead we will relentlessly pursue a host of initiatives that directly 
contribute to the SecDef's priorities of building a more lethal force, strengthening alliances and 
attracting new partners, as well as reforming the Department for greater performance and 
affordability.  In particular, the Deputy Secretary of Defense established the Reform 
Management Group to lead the Department’s business operations reform effort.  This group, 
which is led by the Chief Management Officer in close coordination with the Director of Cost 
Assessment and Program Evaluation, consists of nine cross-functional teams, including 
information technology, human resources, community services, contracts, real property, testing 
and evaluation, medical services, logistics and supply, and financial management.  They are led 
by subject matter experts within their respective fields and call upon their experience and 
relationships within their communities to generate ideas for both immediate and longer term 
business process improvements. 
 
My Principal Deputy leads the real property management reform team, which is identifying “best 
business practices” throughout the Department and across the entire Federal Government that 
can be applied toward increasing resource effectiveness and reducing operating costs on an 
enterprise-wide basis.  Additionally, we are working with local municipalities outside the gates 
of our military installations to gain insights on the “Smart Cities” movement sweeping the nation 
that will enable us to expand the use of public-private and public-public partnerships.  Further, 
we are engaging the private sector to identify and, where feasible, adopt “corporate best 
practices” to enhance the mission assurance of our installations made all the more resilient 
through the application of innovative solutions provided by emerging technologies and bolstered 
by the Internet of Things (IoT).   
 
Though the individual teams are responsible for creating opportunities to increase effectiveness, 
efficiency, and performance throughout the Department of Defense, leadership is responsible for 
overseeing the execution of these reforms.  As we move forward, the Department will be grading 
the reform efforts based on evolving performance and productivity measures, benchmarked from 
private sector best practices, with an enduring focus on increased lethality and improved 
readiness.  
 
Protecting and Enhancing our Training and Test Range Infrastructure 
 
In addition to test and training lands owned by the Department of Defense, we have a close, 
cooperative relationship with the Department of the Interior to manage public lands and off shore 
areas for use by DOD.  This relationship is crucial to our ability to protect and enhance our test 
and training capabilities across the country.  From time to time, we also have a recurring 
requirement to renew public land withdrawals in order to continue military operations.  This 
withdrawal renewal process can take up to seven years, significant resources, and extensive man-
hours to undertake an exhaustive environmental review and other studies for a land use which 
has been in place for decades and is still determined to be of critical use by DOD.  We also have 
been identifying locations where the Department would like to expand ranges, which will 
17 
 
significantly improve the combat credibility of our test and training ranges by offering 
opportunities for more realistic maneuver, attack, and opposing force capabilities.  Offering our 
combatant forces a combined-arms environment more closely resembling what may be 
encountered in a contingency against a peer competitor is a vital element to increasing the 
lethality and readiness of our forces.  As such, we are actively engaged with the Department of 
the Interior on improvements to streamline the review process, thereby reducing the time and 
resources required for execution. 
 
Addressing Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) 
 
The investigation and cleanup of PFOS and PFOA in drinking water where previous Department 
of Defense activities are determined to be the source of the contamination continues to be a top 
priority for my office.  PFOS and PFOA are part of a class of man-made chemicals used in many 
industrial and consumer products to make products resist heat, stains, water, and grease.  In the 
1970s, DOD began using aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), which quickly extinguishes 
petroleum-based fires, but contains PFOS, and in some cases PFOA.   
 
On May 19, 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued Lifetime Health 
Advisories (LHAs) recommending the individual or combined levels of PFOS and PFOA in 
drinking water be below 70 parts per trillion.   
 
In response, the Department began testing DOD drinking water systems to identify drinking 
water that exceeded EPA’s LHA.  DOD has tested all 524 DoD-owned drinking water systems 
worldwide.  As of August 31, 2017, twenty-four DOD drinking water systems tested above the 
LHA and DOD has followed the EPA advisory recommendations, to include providing 
consumers bottled water or additional treatment of water.  Where DOD purchases drinking 
water, we identified 12 drinking water systems where the results are above the EPA LHA level.  
These installations are working with the drinking water supplier to taking appropriate actions 
(such as providing bottled water) to ensure all personnel receive safe drinking water. 
 
Although the EPA LHA level is only guidance under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and 
is not an enforceable drinking water standard, DOD considers the EPA’s LHA toxicity 
information when assessing risk to human health under its cleanup program.  DOD followed a 
comprehensive approach to identify installations where we have stored or used AFFF containing 
PFOS or PFOA and suspect there was a release that may impact drinking water. 
 
As of August 2017, DOD has identified 401 active and BRAC installations where there are one 
or more areas with a known or suspected release of PFOS or PFOA groundwater that may impact 
drinking water off an installation.  The Military Departments are following the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) process.  The DoD 
Components then determine whether there is exposure through drinking water and, if there is 
exposure, the Departments’ priority is to cut off the drinking water exposure.  As of August 
2017, the Military Departments have sampled over 2,600 groundwater wells for PFOS/PFOA (on 
90 installations) with 1,621 sampling results exceeding the EPA LHA.  The Military 
Departments will prioritize sites for further action using a risk-based approach.  The 
Department’s fundamental premise in site prioritization is “worse first,” meaning the DoD 
18 
 
Components will address sites that pose a greater potential risk to human health and the 
environment first.  These known or suspected PFOS and/or PFOA release areas are in various 
stages of assessment, investigation, and cleanup.  Throughout the CERCLA process, the 
Department will work in concert with regulatory agencies and communities, and will share 
information in an open and transparent manner.  Now that we have an initial inventory, it may 
take a few years to determine the potential cleanup costs as we collect information on the nature 
and extent of the releases.  As DOD moves through the CERCLA process, it will be necessary to 
understand the regulatory cleanup standards for PFOS and PFOA. 
 
We are also taking steps to remove and replace AFFF containing PFOS from our supply system.  
In January 2016, the Department issued a policy requiring Service-specific risk management 
procedures to prevent uncontrolled land-based AFFF releases during maintenance, testing, and 
training activities.  The policy also requires the removal and proper disposal of AFFF containing 
PFOS from the local supplies for non-shipboard use where practical.  Each of the Military 
Departments is taking actions to remove AFFF containing PFOS from the supply system. 
 
In addition, SERDP is addressing environmental issues associated with PFOS and PFOA and the 
use of AFFF.  SERDP researchers are developing technologies to quantify and remediate these 
substances in both soil and groundwater.  SERDP is also researching fluorine-free substitutes for 
AFFF which meet the military’s stringent performance requirements.  In FY 2019, ESTCP will 
initiate demonstrations of existing replacement AFFF formulations at DOD facilities to 
determine if their performance can meet DOD’s needs. 
 
Finally, we are working with EPA and States to address the many challenges that have been 
identified since the EPA issued the LHA.  Likewise, we are working with the Agency for Toxic 
Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to support the effort to conduct the exposure 
assessment and health study required by the FY 2018 NDAA.  Addressing PFOS and PFOA is a 
priority for the Department, and we are committed to finding an alternative that meets critical 
mission requirements while protecting human health. 
 
Focus on the Indo-Pacific Region 
 
Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) 
Our posture in the Pacific must be capable of persistent engagement with all countries in the 
Indo-Pacific.  The National Defense Strategy recognizes that China is leveraging military 
modernization, influence operations, and predatory economics to coerce neighboring countries to 
reorder the Indo-Pacific region to their advantage.  As the most forward U.S. territories in the 
Pacific region, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) are 
critical to countering China’s influence.  To that end, the Department’s has three ongoing 
initiatives in Guam/CNMI: the Marine Corps relocation from Okinawa to Guam; a CNMI Joint 
Military Training (CJMT) proposal to develop ranges and training areas on Tinian and Pagan 
Islands; and the establishment of a Divert and Exercise Airfield on the north side of Tinian 
International Airport.  
 
The relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam, which is estimated to cost $8.7 billion and 
involves 5,000 Marines organized as a Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), supports the 
19 
 
Department’s restructured posture in the Indo-Pacific region and our alliance with Japan.  It will 
better align our forward-deployed forces to enable us to respond quickly and effectively to any 
contingency threatening regional security, to ensure rapid delivery of humanitarian assistance in 
response to natural disasters, and to provide a foundation of stability for the continued free 
movement of trade, investment, and commerce.  It will also ensure that we fulfill our 
commitments to the Government of Japan and the Japanese people to reduce the number of 
Marines on Okinawa. 
 
The relocation is expected to achieve initial support capability (ISC) in 2024, contingent on 
affordability and environmental analyses.  The FY 2019 budget request includes $266 million in 
MILCON and Planning & Design funding, including $143 million for a multi-purpose machine 
gun range on Guam.  Last year, the Department awarded approximately $750 million in 
construction projects, including the foundational $309 million utilities and site improvement 
project for the future Marine Corps Base Guam.  Approximately $500 million of these contracts 
come from Japanese-provided funding.  Overall, the Government of Japan has committed $3.1 
billion to fund this relocation and has already transferred $1.5 billion of its commitment to the 
U.S. Treasury. 
 
In addition to ranges constructed on Guam for the Marine relocation, the Department is 
proposing a $910 million initiative to develop ranges and training areas in the CNMI to increase 
joint military training capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region.  The Marine Corps is leading this 
initiative on behalf of the U.S. Pacific Command.  While the Marines relocating to Guam will 
use the proposed CNMI ranges and training areas, these two initiatives have independent utility 
and are being studied under separate environmental analyses.  
 
The Air Force is continuing efforts to establish a divert capability for up to 12 tankers on the 
north side of Tinian International Airport, at an estimated cost of $375 million.  It will also be 
used for humanitarian assistance staging, exercises and other aircraft support activities, 
significantly improving the Air Force's ability to conduct strategic airlift operations and provide 
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  For FY 2019, the budget request includes $51 
million to construct a cargo pad and maintenance facility.  The CNMI’s Commonwealth Ports 
Authority approved the Air Force’s Airport Layout Plan in January and forwarded it to the 
Federal Aviation Administration for final review and approval, allowing us to kick off land lease 
negotiations.  Those efforts are on-going and we anticipate completion sometime later this year.  
 
Public Infrastructure in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)  
U.S. military initiatives are competing with Chinese promises of significant investments in new 
casinos and hotel construction.  As such, public infrastructure assistance is a key component of 
our strategy to foster commitment and cooperation between the Department and the CNMI.   
 
The Mariana Islands play a critical role in providing a platform for maintaining a significant 
forward presence in the Indo-Pacific region.  However, many parts of the CNMI's infrastructure 
are more than 30 years old, and some portions date back to the end of World War II.  The 
tropical climate and typhoons, combined with system age and limited maintenance, have 
degraded the infrastructure even further.  To address the mutual requirement for adequate 
transportation infrastructure, DOD has proposed to partner with the local government and the 
20 
 
local community in the immediate term to carry out civilian infrastructure assistance projects as 
training activities for military engineering units – a win-win for DOD and the community.  For 
FY 2019, the Department is requesting $10.5 million in investments via the Office of Economic 
Adjustment to improve public infrastructure on Tinian.  Providing tangible improvements to the 
local community not only supports our military activities on the island, it demonstrates that DOD 
is committed to the CNMI’s long-term economic growth, advancing Secretary Mattis’ goal of 
strengthening partnerships. 
 
Workforce Issues in Guam and Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)  
Stable economies in Guam and CNMI, underpinned by a sustained labor pool, are critical to the 
Department’s ability to implement the National Defense Strategy and achieve national security 
objectives in the Indo-Pacific region.  However, both Guam and the CNMI are having a difficult 
time sustaining their workforce due to geographic isolation and a small population base.  The 
initial cost just to get to Guam and or the CNMI is generally prohibitive for the type of laborer 
needed, and people from the U.S. mainland are historically hesitant to move so far from family 
and stateside conveniences.  These issues will only get worse when Guam’s/CNMI’s exemption 
from the otherwise applicable nationwide cap for H-2B nonimmigrant workers and the CNMI-
only transitional worker (CW-1) program expires on December 31, 2019.  Without long-term 
access to a foreign labor pool, the economies of these isolated U.S. territories will suffer and the 
cost of ongoing defense projects could skyrocket beyond their current estimates. 
 
Although Section 1049 of the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act provided 
some short-term relief, the Department believes a long-term solution recognizing Guam and the 
CNMI’s unique challenges is necessary.                    
 
Office of Economic Adjustment 
 
The request of $70 million for the Defense Office of Economic Adjustment directly funds 
programs to support and preserve our installations and ranges, including collaborative studies 
with local communities to ensure compatible civilian development.  We also use these funds to 
study and strengthen the resiliency of supply chains to remain responsive to the needs of our 
industrial base through fluctuations in procurement activity.  The Office is an essential interface 
to promote constructive and mutually beneficial alliances and partnerships with local 
communities, States, and territories that provide critical support to our warfighters.  These 
partnerships have fostered an unprecedented level of support and preservation of military 
installations by States and communities who protect our bases as regional economic engines.  
The Office also provides funds to ensure that adequate planning and implementation occurs in 
the expansion of public services and investments to support our existing and growing missions.  
Maintaining support for this Office is crucial to the continued ability of our installations to safely 
and securely operate while responding to fluctuations in military activities, and keeping faith 
with our service members and families by addressing quality of life issues in local defense 
communities.  
 
 
 
 
21 
 
Military Aviation and Installation Assurance Siting Clearinghouse 
 
The Military Aviation and Installation Assurance Siting Clearinghouse is the primary office 
within the Department of Defense charged with the mission to support the expansion of 
commercial energy development and power transmission in the United States in areas and using 
methods that are compatible with preservation and safe operation of military activities and 
capabilities.  The Department appreciates the statutory changes made by Congress to Title 49 of 
the United States Code.  The revised authority increases the public visibility of DoD impacts 
from specific projects, increases State engagement in the impact review process, improves 
DoD’s ability to protect its missions from incompatible energy development, and strengthens 
installation commanders’ ability to highlight potential impacts.  
 
As a result of Congressional direction and our own efforts, we are effectively evaluating the 
mission impact of commercial energy projects to identify and implement affordable and feasible 
mitigation solutions where DOD missions might be adversely impacted.  In 2017 the Department 
reviewed over 4,200 applications for energy projects that were forwarded by the FAA, which 
nearly matched the high number from 2016.  Due to the extensive collaboration between our 
office, local communities, States, and energy developers, no commercial energy project reviewed 
in 2017 rose to the level of an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to present the President’s FY 2019 budget request for DOD 
programs supporting installations, energy, and the environment.  We appreciate Congress’ 
continued support for our enterprise and look forward to working with you as you consider the 
budget request.

NOT FOR PUBLICATION UNTIL RELEASED BY THE 
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE 
 
 
 
 
Chairman Shelby, Vice Chairman Durbin, distinguished members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the current state of Army 
Medicine and the opportunities and the challenges that lie ahead.  Your continued 
support enables Army Medicine to remain ready and responsive in a complex and 
demanding global security environment.  It has been a privilege serving as The 44th 
Army Surgeon General and Commanding General of U.S. Army Medical Command for 
the past two years, and I am incredibly proud to lead a team of talented and dedicated 
professionals.  The strength of our Army is our people, Soldiers, Civilians and Families; 
and we have a solemn obligation to care for those who serve our Nation and their 
Families.   
The United States Army must be prepared for an increasingly complex world.  
Our senior defense leaders continually and clearly articulate the concerns from North 
Korea, Russia, China, Iran, and terrorist threats to the United States. In various ways, 
these potential adversaries challenge America’s power, influence and interests.   Army 
Medicine is prepared to support the Joint Force with scalable medical capabilities in all 
threat scenarios and across all domains.  We know that future multi-domain conflicts will 
require enhanced capabilities, to provide care at the point of injury or illness.  Due to 
tactical or operational circumstances, our healthcare teams may have to provide 
prolonged care in environments lacking robust medical infrastructure.  Further, our 
mission requires that we respond to natural disasters and infectious diseases, including 
possible pandemics and emerging threats. 
  Army Medicine has the opportunity to make significant improvements in 
healthcare as we implement the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal 
Year 2017 (FY17), which will influence how we sustain readiness.  We are working 
closely with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) and the rest of the Joint Health Services 
Enterprise (JHSE) to implement these legislative changes, with thorough analysis, 
deliberate planning and ongoing coordination.  We wholeheartedly support the transition 
efforts and will continue to work diligently with our JHSE colleagues to implement NDAA 
requirements while improving medical readiness, meeting the operational requirements 
of our Combatant Commanders and providing quality healthcare to our patients.

We are the Nation’s premier, expeditionary and globally integrated medical force 
and readiness is my number one priority.  We welcome the recent two-year bipartisan 
budget agreement which promised predictable funding.  With this funding, Army 
Medicine can provide the right medical capabilities our warfighters need and conserve 
the fighting strength of the Total Force.  To that end, we will focus on Readiness, 
Modernization and People, in concert with Reform, to ensure we are always ready.    
 
READINESS AND HEALTH 
The Army Medical Department (AMEDD) has over 180,000 patient contacts 
daily.  To put this in perspective, it is roughly equivalent to reaching each person in 
Huntsville, Alabama every day.  Yet, our readiness mission extends beyond the walls of 
our Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs).  Readiness permeates everything we do from 
prevention and resilience to rehabilitation and transition.  There are two essential 
components that make up readiness: an Army that is medically ready and a medical 
force that is ready to meet the ever-evolving challenges of today and tomorrow. First, 
AMEDD must ensure our Soldiers are physically and mentally fit, ready to deploy 
anywhere, anytime.  Second, we must be a responsive medical capability with clinically 
proficient individuals who are also worldwide deployable and adept in their warrior tasks 
and drills.  Many Army Medicine Soldier readiness initiatives such as the Performance 
Triad, which promotes proper sleep, nutrition and activity to improve overall health and 
reduce obesity; the comprehensive pain management program to reduce reliance upon 
opioids; and advances in traumatic brain injury care have garnered the interest of the 
U.S. Surgeon General. 
 
Soldier Medical Readiness 
Readiness begins with a fit and healthy fighting force and is the foundation of a 
strong national defense.  The strength of our Army is inextricably linked to our Soldiers’ 
health and wellness.  With that foremost in our minds, we have enhanced individual and 
unit readiness in several ways, to include:  leveraging our health and readiness data, an 
electronic profile system and embedding athletic trainers and physical therapists at the 
unit level.  We are also providing nutrition education; wellness centers; and research 
2 
 
through all portions of the performance triad of sleep, activity, and nutrition.  Medical 
readiness is a shared Soldier and command team responsibility.  However, Army 
Medicine plays a decisive role in monitoring, assessing, and identifying key health-
related indicators and outcomes, as well as providing recommendations to mitigate 
risks.   
Through Medical Readiness Transformation (MRT) initiative, Army Medicine 
focused on reducing the number of Soldiers in the most severe non-deployment 
category to increase readiness of the Total Force.  As a result, the Total Force has 
achieved the lowest non-deployable percentage in recent history.  Additionally, the 
medical readiness (MR) of the Total Army consistently improved over the past 12 
months and the Army exceeded the DoD goal.  Current endeavors include the new 
Health and Administrative Portal which expands MR visibility to additional healthcare 
personnel for their supported Soldier populations.  Regarding the dental readiness of 
the force, the Total Army reached a remarkable rate of 97.6%.  MRT allows for better 
decision-making and reporting, while improving communication and transparency 
between Commanders and healthcare providers.     
To assist in Soldier readiness and deployability, we maintain 14 Warrior 
Transition Units (WTUs) across the country.  Warrior Care and Transition embodies the 
Army’s enduring promise to provide high-quality care to our wounded, ill and injured.  
Since the establishment of these organizations, nearly 77,000 Soldiers have completed 
the program with approximately 43% (33,000) returning to duty.  This is roughly 
equivalent to six Brigade Combat Teams.  Our WTUs have helped in increasing 
readiness and provided retention cost savings for the Army.    
The Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) is also an important aspect of 
continually improving Army readiness.  The Army average number of days for 
completing the Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) Phase is performing better than the 
Army standard.  Resourcing DES staff at the MTFs ensures Soldiers are evaluated 
through the process expeditiously, but with care. This translates to increased readiness 
for the Army.  Continuous process improvements and close coordination with external 
stakeholders are necessary for continued success.  
3 
 
Readiness requires a broad and a carefully managed strategy to minimize pain 
during the healing process.  Over the last two decades, Army Medicine has transformed 
its pain management strategy with great success.  Our MTFs have addressed complex 
pain through multidisciplinary pain committees, which periodically review pain care 
plans for high risk patients such as those with complex, difficult injuries; high utilization 
of health care resources; or high risk pain-related behaviors.  In treating acute and 
chronic pain, our holistic management system integrates traditional and non-traditional 
methods to ensure a decrease in the level of pain while restoring patients’ quality of 
sleep, moods, and activity.  In FY 2016, the prevalence of Opioid Use Disorder among 
the active duty Army was 0.15%, much lower than the 0.90% rate in the overall U.S. 
adult population.  Our pain management program is integral to sustaining this process 
by providing quality care, mitigating suffering and returning Soldiers to the fight.  
Next, in support of Army readiness, the Army has made several innovations in 
behavioral health (BH) care which cannot be replicated or purchased in the civilian 
healthcare system.  Army Medicine has led the way with our Embedded Behavioral 
Health (EBH) program.  The practice of assigning BH providers to operational units has 
consistently been recognized as a DoD-wide best practice.  More Soldiers are receiving 
care in the outpatient setting, allowing clinicians to manage BH conditions earlier, before 
crises occur.    
The Behavioral Health Data Portal (BHDP) is recognized as the DoD frontrunner 
in BH outcomes monitoring, as it enables precision medicine, enhances quality and 
continuity of care, and contains systems for providing individual feedback and action at 
the point of care.  Overall use of BH care increased from approximately 900,000 
encounters in FY07 to over 2.25 million in FY17; precision BH care, enabled by the 
BHDP, enhanced the benefit level of treatment provided during these visits.  Army 
Medicine will continue to refine and build on successes in the BHDP to enhance our 
ability to monitor clinical outcome metrics and refine BH programs based on their 
metrics.  We are excited to report we have shared the BHDP with the DHA to implement 
throughout the Services, thereby benefitting all Service Members.  Efforts continue to 
advance BHDP functional integration into MHS GENESIS, the new electronic health 
record for the DoD. 
4 
 
Other key components of ensuring medical readiness are improving our ability to 
execute preventive medicine, public health, health surveillance and health risk 
assessment.  This minimizes incidences or the severity of disease or illness.  AMEDD 
works to protect our people against diseases or Chemical, Biological, Radiological, 
Nuclear, Explosives hazards by applying uniform and timely countermeasures in our 
Army and across the Joint Force.     
 
Ready and Responsive Medical Capability and Force Development 
The demand signal from the Army and the Joint Force is the foundation of our 
ready and responsive medical force.  Their requirements drive how Army Medicine 
recruits, trains and operates, from expeditionary and prehospital to primary and tertiary 
care. This means maintaining our skilled medical force through daily MTF operations, 
medical training, and education programs.  Our training facilities are essential to that 
end. 
We use our Medical Simulation Training Centers at 21 locations to augment 
training outside of our MTFs. For example, the Anderson Simulation Center, located at 
Madigan Army Medical Center, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA, is the first DoD facility 
to be accredited both by the American College of Surgeons and the Society for 
Simulation in Healthcare. The Center is one of seven sites nationwide to hold Level 1 
accreditation by the Society for Simulation in Healthcare and the only site in Washington 
State and Northern Oregon that provides the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery 
(FLS), Endoscopic Surgery (FES), and Robotic Surgery (FRS) via simulation training.  
Anderson serves as the primary training site for FLS training in Washington State and 
certifies both military and civilian doctors in training to meet the simulation requirement 
for their residencies further embracing opportunities to collaborate with civilian partners; 
our Simulation Center at William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso, TX also 
works with the University of Texas for its residency training programs.  We are 
extremely proud of the world class medical education and training we provide. 
Army Medicine runs the largest Graduate Medical Education (GME) training 
program in the DoD.  Annually, we train over 1,500 physicians in our MTFs.  Our 
reputation for superior clinical training and leadership development boosts recruiting 
5 
 
and retention efforts and our first time medical board certification pass rate of about 
92% well exceeds the 86% national average in FY17.  Our GME programs are vital 
force generation and retention tools.  The reach of Army GME extends across all Army 
components.  Those leaving active duty service are a primary source of GME-trained 
physicians for the nation’s civilian healthcare system, as well as the Army Reserves and 
National Guard, helping to offset civilian physician training shortages. 
 In addition to GME, the Army Medical Department Center and School 
(AMEDDC&S) located in San Antonio, Texas is the largest civilian-accredited service 
school.  Annually, we train more than 31,000 U.S. students and 330 International 
students.  This includes enlisted, officers, warrant officers and Civilians in diverse 
graduate, leadership and technical programs.  The AMEDDC&S has 13 Master’s 
Degree Programs and Doctoral Programs, three of which are ranked in the top 10 
nationally by U.S. News and World Report.     
Despite our GME reputation and efforts, we are challenged in our recruiting 
efforts to acquire some low density specialties.  Orthopedic, thoracic, and general 
surgery are critically short specialties for Army Medicine across all components, as are 
emergency medicine, anesthesiology and psychiatry.   
We are actively working to adapt and align residency and fellowship training 
allocations to emphasize the sustainment of trauma care capability.  Moving forward we 
will continue to expand partnerships with civilian institutions to establish enduring 
training agreements.  We are also continuing to collaborate across the Services to 
leverage tri-service training platforms to optimize individual and team training 
opportunities.  Finally, in an effort to recruit and retain these critical skillsets, we 
maximize our use of student loan repayment and financial assistance programs, health 
professions scholarships, accession bonuses and special pay and incentives.  
Predictable, continued funding is essential to maintain and enhance these programs 
and keep them relevant to recruitment and retention efforts. 
The success of Army Medicine is ultimately determined by our ability to meet the 
operational requirements of the Combatant Commanders. The AMEDDC&S developed 
the curriculum for and graduated the first 10 students in December 2017 from the 
Expeditionary Combat Medic (ECM) program. The ECM is a force multiplier that will 
6 
 
produce medics able to provide additional advanced medical services to include 
treatment of common conditions, prevention of disease and treatment of combat trauma 
casualties.  We estimate that the Total Force requirement will be 2,600 ECMs by 2024.  
ECM represents the primary solution to developing prolonged casualty care.  It 
addresses FORSCOM’s needs and we believe this capability will decrease morbidity 
and mortality in a major conflict.   
The lessons of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have informed requirements 
for medical capability and development of force structure.  The Expeditionary 
Resuscitation Surgical Team (ERST) training also at San Antonio is an additional 
training set to increase the readiness of our medical force and meet the operational 
requirements for our Joint Force. The three-week course provides advance surgical, 
resuscitative and critical care training to surgical teams supporting operating forces in 
austere, remote environments.    
In the area of training, Army Medicine has developed Critical Clinical Training 
Task Lists (CCTTLs) for 98 AMEDD Officer Areas of Concentration and 24 enlisted 
military occupational specialties.  This enhances individual and unit readiness in support 
of Army and Combatant Commanders’ war plans and contingency operations by 
codifying unit specific mission essential tasks.   
Army Medicine is also able to increase its readiness through Army and Joint 
Global Health Engagement.  These international programs are a form of medical 
cooperation, advancing best practices in military medicine while assuring our allies and 
partners of our commitment to their security.  Army Medicine is postured to participate in 
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities when directed by our Nation.  
Each of our Services provide medical support to Combatant Commanders as 
directed in strategic and operational documents.  During early phases of any operation, 
setting the theater is essential to mission success and enables successful transition to 
other military operations.  For ground operations, Army medical forces are the likely 
force provider.  Army medical personnel are integrated into all echelons of support from 
organic medical forces in the Brigade Combat Team to theater level hospitalization.  
The AMEDD makes up approximately 70% of medical force structure allocated to 
Combatant Commanders and routinely provide support to the Joint Force.  To reduce 
7 
 
risk to ground-based operations, we must remain ready - manned, trained, and 
equipped, to support military operations.  
Although medical support is a shared responsibility, the Army is responsible for 
providing logistical support to Joint Forces assigned to areas of operation.  Currently 
Army Medicine has been identified as the Theater Lead Agent for Medical Materiel for 
five of six Combatant Commands including the Korean peninsula.  We ensure a 
coordinated and integrated medical logistics support plan for the Joint Force.  For 
contingency operations, AMEDD forces are the lead for the medical logistics support 
essential to operational success.   
 
MODERNIZATION 
Army Medicine has a long history and proven record of support to our Nation, 
from Army surgeons operating independently during the Revolutionary War to our 
current Globally Integrated Operations.  We are continually evolving to meet the 
environment we face.  Thankfully, we have progressed from the era of leeches and 
bloodletting to now employing advanced technologies, such as virtual health and freeze 
dried plasma.  In the process, the battlefield survivability rate and the overall health of 
the force has improved exponentially.  Our successes are due to the great team of 
researchers and modern technologies we employ. 
  The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC) is unique to 
the Department of Defense and drives medical innovation.  It combines Medical 
Research, Development and Acquisition capabilities with strategic and operational 
logistics as a total life cycle management command.  MRMC activities ensure that our 
Soldiers remain in optimal health and are equipped to protect themselves from disease 
and injury.  Cutting edge technology research by our professionals in six medical 
research laboratory commands in the continental United States and across the globe 
have added to the readiness, lethality and survivability of the Total Force.  Proper 
funding has allowed MRMC to make advancements in combat casualty care, clinical 
rehabilitative medicine, medical training, health information, infectious disease 
prevention and operational medicine.  There is no nation on earth that approaches the 
reach and scale of such support to deployable forces.     
8 
 
 
 
Virtual Health (VH) 
Our ability to bring care closer to our patients, deployed or stationed at home, 
through telecommunications is one of the most promising and cost effective 
developments in Army Medicine in a generation.  In 1992, the Army pioneered portable 
virtual health (VH) systems for operations in Somalia.  Twenty-five years later and in 
response to Hurricane Maria, the 14th Combat Support Hospital (14th CSH) deployed to 
Humacao, Puerto Rico where they established clinical operations for our fellow citizens 
including VH capabilities.  The 14th CSH in Puerto Rico coordinated their care through 
providers at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas and Eisenhower Army Medical 
Center in Georgia. 
Since 1992, there has been an exponential improvement in VH, and it is now a 
global endeavor.  The Army designated its first Virtual Medical Center (V-MEDCEN) at 
Brooke Army Medical Center.  We offer over 30 clinical specialties across 18 time 
zones, in over 30 countries and territories, which enables providers to remotely monitor 
patient vitals, provide virtual consultations, and assist medics engaged in combat 
casualty care.  VH is a way to transform access in garrison facilities, patients' homes or 
at points of injury.  The operational benefits of this innovation include providing remote 
trauma and advanced burn care and coaching special lifesaving techniques such as 
methods to decrease intracranial pressure in a Soldier with a traumatic brain injury, 
packing and temporarily closing the abdominal cavity in a gunshot wound survivor 
accessing deep vessels to stop bleeding and save a limb in a Soldier with a severe leg 
wound.  Technology now allows Army Medicine to mitigate the challenge of distance to 
save lives, limbs and eyesight. 
   
Medical Protection 
Protecting the force through treatment or from infectious disease is essential to 
the AMEDD mission.  The DoD, through the MRMC, is the largest sponsor of trauma 
and injury research and development in the Nation. In fact, no other private or federal 
entity provides significant funding to advanced topics in acute casualty care.  Through 
9 
 
this research, the DoD spearheaded development of a first-of-its kind technique to 
control hemorrhaging from inside the blood vessel a balloon that temporarily stops 
blood flow from large blood vessels to the extremities while keeping intact the supply to 
vital organs.  Additionally, MRMC is collaborating with the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) to bring life-saving products such as Freeze-Dried Plasma, through the approval 
process as expeditiously as possible.  Future prolonged battlefield evacuation times will 
require these types of novel solutions to improve battlefield survivability.  
Malaria is still the number one infectious disease threat for deployed forces.   
Due to the efforts of Army infectious disease researchers, two anti-malaria drugs are in 
final stages of clinical trials and FDA license packages.  Two malaria vaccines also 
continue testing in clinical trials as part of a broader DoD malaria vaccine portfolio. For 
the first time, these candidates demonstrate a greater than 85% efficacy, lasting up to 
six months against controlled human malaria infections.  Continued support for these 
programs will result in a viable solution for Service members. 
Finally, our modernization efforts have generated tremendous progress regarding 
traumatic brain injuries (TBIs).  Since 2000, Army personnel have sustained over 
217,000 TBIs, 177,088 of which were classified as mild.  Thanks to Congressional 
funding, the Army researchers at Fort Detrick, Maryland have discovered a new blood 
test to evaluate mild TBI, which was recently approved by the FDA.  Soon, our medical 
personnel will no longer have to rely on the symptoms of concussions alone to diagnose 
TBIs, but will have access to an objective marker of injury to the brain, all from a simple 
blood test.  This test has great potential to change the practice of medicine for brain 
injury, in particular, to quickly evaluate injured Soldiers in remote locations. 
 
PEOPLE 
As previously mentioned, the strength of our Army is its people.  Notably, we 
have a ready medical force capable of global deployment for the full range of military 
operations as we ensure the Total Force is ready to fight and win our Nation’s wars.   
The recruitment, development, employment and retention of Soldiers who are 
adaptive, skilled medical professionals is critical to the ability of Army Medicine to 
conduct its mission across multiple domains.  Properly managing talent management is 
10 
 
of vital importance to enhancing readiness by aligning the unique talents of our people 
to the needs of our Army in supporting the JHSE and any operational requirements.   
Our Soldiers and Civilians must be developed and equipped with tools that 
enable effective, agile and adaptive leaders.  Our education and training must be 
developed in tandem with development of a career progression model that identifies key 
assignments that impart the experience and knowledge crucial to understand and solve 
the complex and dynamic challenges associated with globally integrated health 
services.  These steps will produce medical leaders and staffs who understand how to 
plan, coordinate and build synergy from medical capabilities inherent to all Services, 
interagency, multinational partners and nongovernmental organizations.   
The ultimate outcome is Army Soldiers who are medical professionals capable of 
operating within a joint framework and warfighting leaders informed of the force-
multiplying capabilities of JHSE.  To this end, we are committed to ensuring all Soldiers 
and Civilians are provided full career opportunities to reach their highest potential and 
their vast talent is realized.   
 
Conclusion  
There is no other health service support capability on the planet that compares to 
Army Medicine.  We must be capable of transporting an entire hospital, moving it half 
way around the world at a moment’s notice and establishing it where needed.  We have 
been a reliable health enabler supporting our Army and the Joint Force since 1775 and 
will continue that mission as long as our Army and the Joint Force continue to call on 
us.  Congressional support has enabled Army Medicine to advance military medical 
care in support of our Army, the Joint Force and that has also advanced the healthcare 
system of our Nation.   
  The Strength of our Army is derived from our Soldiers, and in turn, their 
Families.  Our strength is not derived from a weapon or a weapon system alone; it 
originates from our people.  Army Medicine is the driving force behind the medical 
innovations and technologies that allow us to adapt to future challenges that may arise 
at home or abroad.  We will provide prolonged care at the point of need and through 
every echelon of care, while continuing to meet or exceed national quality of care 
11 
 
standards.  This is our solemn obligation to our Nation; our readiness to support our 
Nation’s Army will always be assured.   
I remain committed working with all of our DoD, Joint, interagency, 
intergovernmental, multinational and civilian partners to improving readiness, enhancing 
the healthcare delivered to our beneficiaries, evolving to support the Army and Joint 
Force in future conflicts, and continuing to take care of our Soldiers, Civilians, and their 
Families.  I appreciate the subcommittee’s work and continued support to our Soldiers, 
Army Medicine and our Army.

Comptroller General of the United States  
 
 
 
GAO-18-426T   
 
Letter  Letter 
 
 
 
    
Chairman Daines, Ranking Member Murphy, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss our fiscal year 
(FY) 2019 budget request. I very much appreciate the confidence this 
subcommittee has shown in supporting our efforts to serve the Congress 
and improve government performance, accountability, and transparency. 
Since 2014, this Committee has provided funding that has resulted in our 
work achieving over $265 billion in financial benefits and more than 5,000 
other improvements in federal programs and government operations. Last 
fiscal year alone, our work generated almost $74 billion in financial 
benefits and 1,280 program and operational improvements across 
government. This resulted in a return of $128 for every dollar invested in 
GAO. GAO’s work was also incorporated into appropriation and 
authorization legislation passed over the past year, including 
requirements for federal agencies to implement GAO’s recommendations. 
I also thank the Committee for its support for our FY 2018 appropriation. 
We have revised both our FY 2018 operating plan and our FY 2019 
request to reflect the new appropriation level, including the disaster 
assistance supplemental funds we received. In FY 2018, we will begin 
hiring additional staff, achieving a full-time equivalent (FTE) level of 3,020 
and positioning us to reach 3,100 FTE in FY 2019. The funding level will 
also allow us to invest in information technology and building facility 
projects that will improve efficiency and reduce long-term operating costs. 
Our FY 2019 request is at the same funding level as FY 2018. With these 
resources, we will achieve a staffing level of 3,100 FTE, allowing us to 
better serve Congress as it addresses many critical domestic and 
international challenges and fulfills its oversight responsibilities, as well as 
enable GAO to continue making important contributions to improving 
government performance and accountability. 
 
Fiscal Year 2019  GAO is requesting budget authority of $614.8 million for FY 2019. This 
will fund the necessary activities to continue to meet the highest priority 
Request 
needs of the Congress. The funding will allow us to cover mandatory pay 
and inflationary cost increases, and achieve increases in our on-board 
staff. The request includes an appropriation of $578.9 million and $35.9 
million in offsetting receipts and reimbursements from program and 
financial audits, rental income, training fees, bid protest fees, and funds 
provided to GAO for mandated work. 
Page 1  GAO-18-426T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Congressional Budget Justification (CBJ) submitted in January 
presented a FY 2018 direct appropriation of $540.8 million plus $33.0 
million in offsets reflecting the continuing resolution level. To avoid 
exceeding this level and out of uncertainty about the final appropriation, 
we developed a prudent hiring plan that would have resulted in 2,900 full 
time equivalents (FTE) in FY 2018. 
With the two-year budget agreement and funding enacted for FY 2018, 
including $10 million in 2-year funding for information technology and 
building infrastructure projects, we revised both our FY 2018 operating 
plan and our FY 2019 budget request. The information technology 
investments lower our operational costs in the long run and the 
investments in infrastructure will allow us to bring in a new tenant and 
increase our rental revenue. This will allow GAO to put more funds into 
human capital in the future. We now plan to accelerate hiring for the rest 
of this fiscal year. The revised plan will put us in a position to achieve 
3,100 FTE in FY 2019 without an increase over the FY 2018 
appropriation level, moving GAO closer to its optimal staffing level of 
3,250 FTE. The chart below provides a summary by program for the 
revised FY 2019 request.

cybersecurity issues and the threats to the nation’s critical infrastructure; 
2) continue our focus on a range of rapidly evolving science and 
technology issues; 3) bolster our reviews of the increased investment in 
Department of Defense programs; and 4) assess the challenges 
associated with growing federal health care costs. In FY 2018, we plan to 
utilize 3,020 FTE, an increase of 120 over the level included in the CBJ.

Currently, we plan to use $8 million of the disaster supplemental in FY 
2018 and FY 2019 (approximately $2 million and $6 million, respectively). 
Cyber-Based Threats to the Nation’s Systems and Critical 
Infrastructure – The cyberattacks suffered by the Office of Personnel 
Management, Equifax, and other large organizations in recent years 
highlight the criticality of more effective cybersecurity. Threats from state 
and non-state actors are growing in sophistication and scope and can 
have a serious, or even potentially catastrophic, impact on federal 
systems, the nation’s critical infrastructure, and the privacy and safety of 
the general public. 
As Congress turns to GAO for insightful analysis and advice to address 
these rapidly evolving threats, recruiting top-tier cyber talent to augment 
our current audit workforce is critical. GAO plans to recruit talent from 
leading cybersecurity-related undergraduate and graduate institutions, 
including those participating in the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service 
program. This would augment our existing cadre of experts who can 
assess the nature and extent of cyber risks, both present and future, as 
well as evaluate the government’s complex and multi-faceted attempts to 
address them. 
In particular we plan to continue our focus on ensuring the security of 
federal information systems and cyber critical infrastructure,1 two key 
components of our cyber High Risk area. Over the next 2 years, our 
planned efforts include assessing government-wide initiatives to 
implement continuous diagnostics and monitoring capabilities, establish 
effective risk management processes at federal agencies, and work with 
the private sector responsible for critical infrastructure. 
Other planned activities include evaluating key agency capabilities for 
responding to security incidents and data breaches, as well as assessing 
                                                                                                                     
1 Critical infrastructure includes systems and assets so vital to the United States that 
incapacitating or destroying them would have a debilitating effect on national security. 
These critical infrastructures are grouped by the following 16 industries or “sectors”: 
chemical; commercial facilities; communications; critical manufacturing; dams; defense 
industrial base; emergency services; energy; financial services; food and agriculture; 
government facilities; health care and public health; information technology (IT); nuclear 
reactors, materials, and waste; transportation systems; and water and wastewater 
systems.

their security postures through detailed vulnerability assessments and 
penetration testing of agency network defenses. For example, the 
Explanatory Statement accompanying the 2018 Omnibus Appropriations 
Act required GAO to evaluate information security at the Office of 
Personnel Management and the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
both of which have had recent major data breaches. 
Regarding the protection of cyber critical infrastructure, we plan to focus 
on the cybersecurity of specific sectors, such as the electricity grid, and 
oil and gas pipeline subsectors, and evaluate the effectiveness of the 
public-private partnership model as a framework for protecting the 
nation’s critical assets from cyber threats. 
Impact of Scientific and Technological Advances – Rapid advances in 
science and technology play an important role in our society as they can 
impact economic growth as well as the social and environmental well-
being of the United States. Although such advances will remain central to 
the prevailing issues of our day, including economic competitiveness, 
improved medical care and the prevention of disease, and information 
security, the ability of the United States to lead these advances is 
increasingly challenged. 
Given the persistent and growing demand for this technical work, GAO 
strives to continue to build our staff capacity in this growing area. We now 
have developed best practice guides related to capital project cost 
estimating, project scheduling, and assessing technology readiness, and 
will apply these guides in assessing multi-billion dollar federal projects at 
agencies including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, 
Energy, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
We plan to expand and accelerate our work including potential technology 
readiness assessment evaluations of complex technical acquisitions such 
as the Columbia class Navy nuclear submarine, the Joint Strike Fighter, 
the James Webb Space Telescope, DHS border protection technologies, 
and Uranium Processing Facility. Strategic technology reports on artificial 
intelligence systems, freshwater technologies in agriculture, sustainable 
chemistry, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria will be completed or initiated 
by FY 2019. Based on interest expressed by various Committees of 
jurisdiction, potential future work would focus on block-chain 
technologies, artificial intelligence in health care, autonomous vehicles, 
and personalized medicine.

Assisting Congress in Overseeing and Transforming the Department 
of Defense – The Department of Defense (DOD) faces significant 
challenges in responding to a complex and rapidly evolving national 
security environment. Considerable resources are entrusted to it to do so, 
about 48 percent (more than $671 billion) of discretionary appropriations 
for fiscal year 2018. This represents a nearly 10 percent increase over the 
fiscal year 2017 enacted level of almost $612 billion. The President’s 
budget for fiscal year 2019 further proposes to increase this to more than 
$686 billion. Concurrently, DOD is working to sustain and advance its 
military superiority while it undergoes one of the most significant 
organizational realignments since the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986.2 
Congress has directed GAO to review a broad range of DOD’s activities. 
Since 2006, GAO has made over 3,000 recommendations to DOD 
designed to strengthen the department’s programs and operations, and 
this work has resulted in over $63 billion in financial benefits since fiscal 
year 2015. To inform the new Congress and administration, GAO 
highlighted much of this work last year in a special report identifying five 
key challenges facing DOD – rebalancing and rebuilding forces, 
mitigating cyber risks and expanding cyber capabilities, controlling costs 
and managing finances, strategically managing human capital, and 
achieving greater efficiencies in business operations – as well as the 
factors that have impacted the department’s progress in these areas. 
GAO will continue to allocate significant resources to review a broad 
range of DOD’s activities. For example, the latest National Defense 
Authorization Act contains provisions for GAO to continue to support 
congressional oversight of DOD’s efforts to balance current operational 
deployments with training and equipping forces capable of fulfilling the full 
spectrum of military operations, such as through assessments of the 
department’s efforts to rebuild readiness and modernize for the future. 
We will further review the plans, organization and capabilities of the 
department’s cyber operations; the safety and effectiveness of the U.S. 
strategic nuclear force; and DOD’s investments in science and 
technology, which provide innovations to enhance the superiority of 
weapon systems now and in the future. We will assess the extent to 
which the Defense Contract Audit Agency and Defense Contract 
Management Agency are effectively and efficiently overseeing

contractors’ primary business systems, such as accounting and property 
management. 
We will also continue to assess the department’s strategies and 
incentives for recruiting, retaining, and developing a workforce that 
accounts for nearly 50 percent of the department’s budget, as well as 
contracting approaches DOD uses to buy the billions in goods and 
services needed to carry out its missions. Further, as DOD implements 
key organizational changes mandated by the Congress, we expect 
Congressional interest in the department’s progress and associated 
impacts. These changes include the creation of a Chief Management 
Officer position and implementation of cross-functional teams to drive 
organizational change, as well as the creation of the offices of the Under 
Secretary for Research and Engineering and Under Secretary for 
Acquisition and Sustainment. We will also continue to assess DOD’s 
progress in following Congressional direction to recommend a new 
organizational and management structure for its national security space 
components. 
GAO will continue to focus on DOD issues through its work to update the 
biennial High Risk report for 2019. Seven DOD areas are included in our 
High Risk report, including financial management, weapon systems 
acquisitions, business systems modernization, and support infrastructure 
management, as well as designations in 11 additional areas, such as the 
government-wide personnel security clearance process, added to the 
High Risk list earlier this year, in which DOD shares responsibility with 
other federal agencies. GAO’s annual work to review fragmentation, 
overlap and duplication in the federal government will report on DOD’s 
efforts to achieve efficiencies, such as across its defense agencies and 
field activities, as well as efforts to achieve efficiencies in the 
management of its over 500 installations worldwide. 
GAO’s annual “Quick Look” reports, assessing the cost, schedule, and 
performance of about 80 major defense acquisition programs, help 
support the Congress in overseeing the department’s $1.5 trillion in 
planned spending on these systems. One particular focus in the coming 
year is on the costs, schedule, and technical capabilities of the Columbia 
class nuclear submarine program, one of DOD’s largest acquisitions. 
Finally, DOD’s financial management challenges remain a High Risk area 
that continues to negatively affect DOD’s ability to manage the 
department and make sound decisions on mission and operations. For 
example, DOD’s financial management problems have contributed to (1) 
Page 7  GAO-18-426T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
inconsistent and sometimes unreliable reports to Congress on weapon 
system operating and support costs and (2) an impaired ability to make 
cost-effective choices, such as deciding whether to outsource specific 
activities or how to improve efficiency through technology. 
DOD’s financial weaknesses are one of three major impediments 
preventing a GAO opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the 
federal government. With DOD’s reported discretionary spending making 
up nearly half of the federal government’s reported discretionary 
spending, and its reported assets representing more than 70 percent of 
the federal government’s reported physical assets, monitoring DOD’s 
efforts to achieve auditability represents a major GAO responsibility. To 
fulfill that responsibility, we will, in coordination with the DOD Office of 
Inspector General, actively monitor (1) the financial audits of the military 
services and other defense organizations, and (2) DOD’s progress in 
implementing corrective actions for identified deficiencies, which currently 
number over 1,000. With DOD’s start of mandated full financial statement 
audits in fiscal year 2018, this effort will require increased levels of GAO 
staffing and resources. 
Assisting Congress in Health Care Challenges – Growth in federal 
spending for major health care programs, estimated at $1 trillion in fiscal 
year 2017, has exceeded the growth of GDP historically and is projected 
to grow faster than the economy. 
These health care programs include Medicare, Medicaid, and the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program, along with federal subsidies for 
health insurance purchased through the marketplaces established by the 
ACA and related spending. These federal commitments to health care 
programs are a key driver of the nation’s fiscal spending. Growth in 
federal spending on health care is driven both by increasing enrollment, in 
part due to the aging of the population, and health care spending per 
person. 
The federal government faces challenges to effectively and efficiently 
managing health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and 
programs that serve American Indians, veterans, and military service 
members. Specifically, the demands to meet Americans’ health needs are 
growing in volume and complexity while oversight is becoming more 
challenging. Understanding these complexities and offering fact-based 
recommendations to address them requires advanced policy and 
analytical expertise. 
Page 8  GAO-18-426T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our health care policy expertise is frequently sought out by Congress on 
a range of health care issues. In 2017, we issued products for 32 different 
Committees and Subcommittees that examined access to and quality of 
care, drug availability and pricing, program expenditures and integrity, the 
protection of public health, and health care markets. 
We have made recommendations in these audit products to improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of federal health care spending, and 
documented almost $2 billion in savings in 2017 alone by agencies taking 
action on our recommendations. 
GAO will continue to focus on health care issues through its work to 
update the biennial High Risk report. With our 2017 High-Risk Update, we 
designated the Indian Health Service (IHS) as high risk. This area joins 
four other federal health care programs on the High Risk list, Medicare, 
Medicaid, the Food and Drug Administration, and VA Health Care. 
Finally, GAO will continue to devote resources for our health care work on 
the most pressing public health-related issues of today. For example, we 
have a growing body of work examining the federal government’s 
response to the ongoing opioid epidemic, which killed more than 42,000 
Americans in 2016. However, more work is needed on the federal 
government’s efforts to prevent opioid and other illicit drug use. We will 
also continue to examine the pricing and utilization of health care 
services-key drivers of public and private health care spending and costs. 
Managing federal health care spending, and holding entities accountable 
for the outcomes of such spending, will be critical to restoring the nation 
to a fiscally sustainable long term path. 
 
GAO Information  The resources we received for FY 2018, and request for FY 2019, will 
allow GAO to make strategic investments in information technology (IT), 
Technology and 
and GAO’s facilities infrastructure. GAO greatly appreciates the two-year 
Building Infrastructure  designation of $10 million in Infrastructure Operations spending provided 
for in the FY 2018 budget. This funding flexibility will enable GAO to make 
sound capital investments in new technology and address important 
funding requirements in support of our building facilities that will increase 
efficiency, lower operating costs, and allow us to increase our rental 
revenue. 
Information Technology – At present, GAO operates in a computing 
environment that is rapidly aging. We have made headway over the past 
few years to improve our infrastructure by implementing a virtual desktop 
Page 9  GAO-18-426T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
infrastructure and consolidating 11 remote field office data centers into a 
single primary data center at Headquarters. Additionally, we replaced 
older server technology for data storage with newer, faster, more efficient 
technology that strengthens the agency’s security and reduces costs. 
With the funding provided by Congress, we will be able to build on these 
past improvements and make additional critical investments that will 
further improve our effectiveness and efficiency and provide long term 
cost savings. 
Modernizing our current communications system is an important project 
that is enabled by this funding.  Our current technology is near its end of 
life and a significant capital expense would have been required to 
upgrade this old technology.  Over the next two years, GAO will now 
upgrade to communications technologies that will greatly enhance GAO’s 
capabilities and replace aging technology.  GAO will be able to take 
advantage of key features incorporated into new tools that would not be 
possible with legacy systems. 
For example, we will replace our obsolete video and teleconferencing 
equipment that is no longer supported and is proving to be extremely 
challenging to maintain and utilize effectively.  We will upgrade our 
software to take advantage of integrated collaborative technologies, such 
as instant messaging, desktop sharing, and video conferencing.  These 
technologies, VoIP services, in an integrated platform using digital voice 
services are less expensive to maintain saving GAO significant annual 
maintenance costs and recurring capital expenses. In summary, this 
improvement to our system will make it easier for our staff to work 
together more effectively, and is less expensive to operate. 
Furthermore, this investment in GAO will enable us to begin the migration 
from our current document management system that is over 30 years old, 
to modern technology that provides greater capabilities. Our current 
document management system is used daily by all GAO staff and houses 
all of GAO’s audit documents, as well as information obtained from 
agencies, and data analysis that forms the basis of GAO’s products. The 
current system is slow and difficult to use, yet critical to our success. By 
upgrading the system, we will stabilize this important software platform 
and improve the user experience resulting in greater efficiencies. 
This modernization effort will be built upon the success of previous work 
we have done to improve our infrastructure and develop tools that make 
our efforts to produce work more efficient. We will continue to upgrade 
Page 10  GAO-18-426T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
key systems that directly support the products and services we provide to 
the Congress. We have successfully implemented a new Engagement 
Management System (EMS) that helps us manage our work more 
efficiently and we have a prototype of the New Blue system that will both 
greatly improve how we create and share GAO content with our clients. 
New Blue is an enterprise-wide effort which will allow GAO to easily 
publish web-based products in HTML format instead of the static PDF 
format in a way that reduces manual activities for analysts and publishing 
staff.  It will enable analysts to perform different functions concurrently 
and eliminate the need for separate copies for drafting, referencing, and 
each review. It will also streamline publishing and enable consistent and 
flexible distribution via multiple channels with responsive design that will 
allow our reports to be read on any device. 
An enormous amount of effort has gone into upgrading and securing our 
information technology systems and with this new flexibility and funding in 
FY 2018 and FY 2019 we are going to make substantial headway toward 
completing our modernization efforts. 
Facilities and Security – While most of GAO’s staff is located at its 
Headquarters in Washington, DC, we maintain a presence in strategic 
locations throughout the country and this remains a priority. GAO is 
consolidating space within its Headquarters building to ensure efficient 
utilization. With respect to our building investments, GAO is currently 
undergoing moves, as commercial leases expire, to secure federal office 
spaces in Oakland, California, Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California, 
and Huntsville, Alabama. By moving into federal controlled space we are 
providing increased physical security for our employees and locally stored 
data. 
We appreciate the support of the committee for providing us with the 
authority to transfer funding to the U.S. Army to build GAO a new building 
on the grounds of the Redstone Arsenal Army Base to house GAO’s 
existing Huntsville staff. This new building will be a one-time expense, 
with no rent and minimal maintenance costs going forward saving GAO 
what it would have paid in rent. We expect completion of the new building 
in the next year. Additionally, with the two-year funding, we will make 
investments in our Headquarters building by consolidating and upgrading 
space enabling us to lease empty space to new tenants.

Assisting the  GAO continues to be recognized for its non-partisan, objective, fact-
based, and professional analyses across the full breadth and scope of the 
Congress in Shaping 
federal government’s responsibilities and the extensive interests of 
Legislation  Congress. 
Since our last budget request, Congress has passed a number of laws 
that reflect GAO findings and recommendations. For example: 
  The National Defense Reauthorization Act of 2018 (NDAA) 
included several directives based on GAO findings and 
recommendations concerning defense-related and other issues. 
Specifically 
  Improving defense-related efforts in key areas such as budget 
guidelines; cost savings; leadership of business operations; 
military readiness goals and implementation strategies; potential 
vulnerabilities in military aircraft; risks to military installations from 
climate change; and sustainability for the F-35 combat aircraft. 
  Requiring additional reporting requirements to help keep the 
Columbia-class submarine program on track, raising the cost cap 
for the Ford-class carrier program, and directing changes to 
DOD’s space leadership structure. In addition, the reauthorization 
includes funding reductions warranted by GAO findings. 
  Requiring annual reports on the time required to conduct 
investigations, adjudicate cases, and grant security clearances. 
This reflects a matter GAO raised for Congress’s consideration in 
2017, namely that such reporting should be reinstated given the 
need to continue efforts to reform the personnel security clearance 
process government-wide, an area that GAO placed on the high-
risk list in January 2018. 
  Changing the Small Business Administration’s Historically 
Underutilized Business Zone Program that provides federal 
contracting preferences for eligible small businesses. In making 
these changes, Congress relied on our analysis of the use of 
unemployment rates in making business zone designations to 
better target counties with depressed economic conditions. 
  The No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act 
directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop a quality 
assurance document for carrying out the toll-free Veterans Crisis Line 
requires VA to develop a plan to ensure that each telephone call, text 
message, and other communications received is answered in a timely 
Page 12  GAO-18-426T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
manner. These requirements reflect GAO’s recommendations related 
to ensuring that veterans who called the crisis line had their calls 
answered in a timely manner. 
  The FITARA Enhancement Act of 2017 extended until 2020 the 
deadline for federal agencies to optimize their data centers, reflecting 
the GAO recommendation that they be given more time to do so. In 
line with previous GAO findings, that act also made permanent the 
requirement that agencies evaluate, manage, and publicly report on 
the risk of their major information technology investments. 
  GAO’s reports and testimonies are also reflected in the 2018 
Omnibus Appropriations Act, including: 
  Using GAO work to direct agencies to implement GAO 
recommendations. For example, the act directed 
  the Department of Homeland Security to develop robust 
performance metrics for all deployed border security; begin 
the collection of performance data to evaluate the 
individual and collective contribution of specific 
technologies; and assess progress in fully deploying 
planned technologies and determine when mission 
benefits from such deployments have been fully realized, 
citing a GAO testimony; and 
  the Secretary of the Department of the Interior to take 
several steps to improve Indian education, including 
implementing GAO recommendations and restructuring 
Indian Affairs to better support management control and 
accountability for the Bureau of Indian Education system. 
  Requiring agencies to report on how they plan to implement GAO 
recommendations or what corrective action plans they plan to 
take. For example: 
  having the entity responsible for managing cybersecurity 
across the federal government and critical infrastructure, the 
National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration 
Center (NCCIC), report on plans to implement GAO 
recommendations to determine if it is carrying out its statutory 
functions, such as sharing information about cyber threats, in 
the way it should: making the information timely, relevant and 
actionable, and to establish performance metrics for them;  
  having the Bureau of Indian Affairs report on progress to 
implement recommendations on data to improve road 
Page 13  GAO-18-426T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
management and inform student attendance strategies, citing 
a GAO 2017 report; 
  having the Indian Health Service report on how it will address 
GAO recommendations on setting and monitoring agency wide 
standards for patient wait time and IT issues related to this 
monitoring, citing a GAO 2016 report; 
  having the Department of Defense (DOD) report on efforts to 
align the structure, statutory parameters and regulatory 
guidance across all Federal prescription drug buying programs 
to increase buying power and reduce costs, citing a GAO 
recommendation to the same effect; and 
  having the Bureau of Indian Affairs report on barriers to 
developing strategies to properly manage oversight of energy 
resources, citing a GAO 2017 report. 
  Finally, providing funding to enable activities aligned with GAO 
recommendations. For example, the act appropriated funds to: 
  the Department of Homeland Security to conduct regular 
assessments of advanced protective technologies related to 
cybersecurity, citing a 2016 GAO report; the Department of 
Health and Human Services for grants for clinical training of 
sexual assault nurse examiners to administer medical forensic 
examinations and treatments to victims of sexual assault, 
citing a GAO 2016 report; and the Veterans Health 
Administration for research into overmedication of veterans 
that led to veterans’ deaths, suicides, and mental health 
disorders, among other things, citing multiple GAO reports. 
 
Financial and  Financial Benefits – In fiscal year 2017, we documented $73.9 billion in 
financial benefits for the government – a return of about $128 for every 
Program Benefits 
dollar invested in us. Examples of our work that contributed to these 
benefits included (1) improving the Department of Defense’s (DOD) 
processes for acquiring weapon systems ($36.0 billion); (2) auctioning of 
the broadcast television spectrum by the Federal Communications 
Commission ($7.3 billion); and (3) reducing the amount TRICARE pays 
for compounded drugs ($1.9 billion). 
Other Benefits – Many other benefits resulting from our work cannot be 
measured in dollars but lead to program and operational improvements. 
In fiscal year 2017, we recorded 1,280 of these other benefits. For 
example, our work on public safety and security: 
Page 14  GAO-18-426T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  led the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to tighten its controls on 
licensing for possession of radioactive materials when, in one of our 
tests, investigators secured agreements to buy devices that, together, 
contained a dangerous quantity of material; 
  led FEMA to better prepare for its future disaster response activities 
by developing (1) a plan to finance equipment for its urban search and 
rescue task forces, and (2) a process to apply lessons learned from its 
incident management assistance teams; and 
  led the Food and Drug Administration to issue a final rule requiring 
drug companies to report data on the sale and distribution of 
antibiotics for use in food animals. 
Similarly, our work related to vulnerable populations: 
  led the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue a 
strategy addressing the use of opioids such as heroin and prescription 
pain medications during pregnancy, which can lead to newborns 
having a condition called Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; 
  led the Veterans Administration to improve its oversight and process 
for providing veterans newly enrolled in its health care system with 
timely access to primary care appointments; and 
  led several agencies, including the Departments of Homeland 
Security, the Interior, and State, to better protect contractor 
employees against reprisal, when they identify fraud, waste, abuse, or 
mismanagement. 
Furthermore, our work in the area of agency operations: 
  led DOD to establish categories for prioritizing its more than 83,000 
missing persons cases from military conflicts since World War II, 
based on the feasibility of recovery; 
  prompted the Social Security Administration to not provide increases 
in monthly disability insurance benefit payments until it had 
determined if individuals’ earnings required changes in benefits—
preventing overpayments to about 4,300 beneficiaries in 2016; 
  prompted DOD to strengthen its oversight of equipment provided to 
Iraq’s security forces by developing new procedures for recording 
equipment transfer dates and making other planned changes to 
improve accountability; and 
  led OMB and the Department of the Treasury to improve 
implementation of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of

2014 (P.L. 113-101) by clarifying requirements, using implementation 
plans, and documenting procedures. 
 
Building Bodies of  Through the products we issued in fiscal year 2017, we continued to build 
on bodies of work to address our three broad strategic goals for serving 
Knowledge 
the Congress and the nation to (1) address current and emerging 
challenges to the well-being and financial security of the American 
people, (2) help respond to changing security threats and global 
interdependence, and (3) help transform the federal government to 
address national challenges. Examples include: 
Protection of children – We reported on the (1) federal support for 
pediatric trauma care centers—used to treat children with potentially life-
threatening or disabling injuries; (2) federal support for states to oversee 
the use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care; and (3) 
federal coordination on early learning and childcare. 
Veterans – We reported on the need to improve (1) management of 
veterans’ health care, (2) protections for veterans against financial 
exploitation; and (3) the Department of Veterans Affairs’ use of vacant 
and underutilized property to house homeless veterans. 
Health care – We reported on the (1) actions needed to prevent illegal 
drug use, such as opioids; (2) federal efforts to position the physician 
workforce to meet current and future demands; and (3) need to 
harmonize federal and state rules to better protect Medicaid beneficiaries 
receiving personal care services. 
Science and technology – We reported on (1) the Internet of Things, 
smart technologies and devices that sense information and communicate 
it to the Internet or other networks—offering new benefits and potential 
risks to IT, privacy, and safety; and (2) medical device technologies 
designed to rapidly diagnose infectious diseases. 
Military readiness – We reported in FY 2017 and prior years on the: (1) 
considerable readiness challenges facing the Military Departments; (2) 
need for better strategies, goals and metrics for guiding the departments’ 
readiness rebuilding efforts, and more oversight of these efforts by the 
Office of the Secretary of Defense; and (3) Navy’s training, manning and 
infrastructure challenges that have contributed its readiness crisis. 
Page 16  GAO-18-426T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
High Risk areas – We issued the biennial update of our high-risk report 
to focus attention on government operations that are highly vulnerable to 
fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement or need transformation. It offers 
solutions to 35 high-risk problems, including four new areas, federal 
Indian education, health, and energy programs; federal environmental 
liabilities; government-wide personnel security clearance processes; and 
the 2020 Census (see Enclosure I). For example, we reported on the 
enormous challenge that a complete count of the nation’s population is for 
the Bureau of Census as it seeks to control the cost of the census while it 
implements several new innovations and manages the processes of 
acquiring and developing new and modified information technology (IT) 
systems supporting them. Over the past 4 years, we have made 33 
recommendations specific to the Bureau regarding the 2020 Census. As 
of October 2017, the Bureau had fully implemented 10 of the 
recommendations, and was at varying stages of implementing the 
remaining recommendations. 
In 2017, our High Risk work contributed to 154 reports, 43 testimonies, 
$42.2 billion in financial benefits, and 519 other benefits. In the last 
decade this work has led to about $240 billion in financial benefits. 
Fragmentation, overlap, and duplication – Our seventh annual report 
identified 79 new actions across 29 new areas that could reduce 
fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, or provide other cost savings and 
revenue enhancement opportunities across the federal government. 
Actions taken by the Congress and executive branch agencies to address 
the 645 actions government-wide we identified from 2011 to 2016, have 
led to about $136 billion in financial benefits – $75 billion to date, with $61 
billion more expected. 
Testimonies – In FY 2017, senior GAO Officials testified 99 times before 
45 separate committees or subcommittees on issues that touched all 
major federal agencies. The following, listed by our three strategic goals, 
are examples of topics GAO addressed in testimony:

Focusing on  Serving Our Clients – In fiscal year 2017, we received 739 requests for 
work from 92 percent of the standing committees of the Congress – 
Congressional 
supporting a broad range of congressional interests. We issued 658 
Priorities  reports and made 1,414 new recommendations. Our senior executives 
were asked to testify before 45 separate committees or subcommittees 
on topics including the nation’s fiscal health; Navy readiness; preventing 
high-risk travelers from boarding U.S. bound flights; and improving the 
response to Zika virus outbreaks. Our testimonies continued to 
Page 18  GAO-18-426T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
underscore the importance of implementing GAO’s recommendations to 
strengthen the government’s performance and yield financial benefits. 
Outreach Efforts – I continued my regular meetings with the Chairs and 
Ranking Members of congressional committees to obtain their views on 
GAO’s work, including their priorities, and to discuss opportunities and 
challenges facing our nation. 
I also sent letters to the heads of most federal departments to 
acknowledge the actions taken to date to implement our prior 
recommendations and to draw their attention to priority recommendations 
still requiring their attention. These letters were also sent to the 
congressional committees of jurisdiction to inform their oversight. 
We continue to collaborate with the Congress to revise or repeal 
mandated reporting requirements to align our work with current 
congressional priorities and maximize our staff resources. For example, 
S. 2400, the GAO Audit Mandates Revision Act of 2018, would shift many 
low-risk financial audits to public accounting firms so GAO can audit 
Treasury’s General Fund. The fund, which has never been audited 
before, covers every federal entity that receives appropriated funds. 
 
Internal  Supporting Our People – The hard work and dedication of our diverse 
and professional multidisciplinary staff positioned GAO to achieve a 96 
Improvements 
percent on-time delivery of our products in fiscal year 2017. Our 
performance this year also indicates that staff received the support 
needed to produce high-quality work. GAO also continued its distinction 
as a best place to work in the federal government, ranking second among 
mid-size federal agencies and first for supporting diversity by the 
Partnership for Public Service. 
Managing Our Internal Operations – In fiscal year 2017, we continued 
efforts to maximize our value by enabling quality, timely service to the 
Congress and being a leading practices federal agency. We made 
progress addressing our three internal management challenges – human 
capital management, engagement efficiency, and information security. To 
enhance engagement efficiency, we fully transitioned to an updated 
engagement management process and new management system. 
We also undergo an annual independent financial statement audit. For FY 
2017, our financial statements received an unmodified “clean” opinion 
once again. This unmodified opinion along with our effective internal 
controls, demonstrate our sound stewardship of the taxpayers’ dollars 
Page 19  GAO-18-426T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
entrusted to us. Our independent auditors found that GAO maintained, in 
all material aspects, effective internal control over financial reporting, and 
our financial management systems substantially complied with the 
applicable requirements of the Federal Financial Management 
Improvement Act of 1996. 
In addition, independent organizations perform a peer review of GAO’s 
system of quality control for work done under generally accepted 
government auditing standards to determine whether it is suitably 
designed and operating effectively. The peer review includes a review of 
audit documentation, tests of functional areas, and staff interviews. Our 
most recent external peer review, conducted by a team of international 
auditors, resulted in a clean opinion on the effectiveness and 
appropriateness of our quality assurance framework. We also 
demonstrated that our detailed performance and financial information is 
complete and reliable and meets our high standards for accuracy and 
transparency. 
 
Legal Work  In FY 2017, our Office of General Counsel created an electronic bid 
protest filing system, handled about 2,600 bid protests, issued over 500 
bid protest and other decisions, including appropriations law decisions, 
and issued the third chapter of the fourth edition of “Principles of Federal 
Appropriations Law”. This is the primary resource for appropriations law 
guidance in the federal community. 
 
Strategic Planning  I am pleased to announce that GAO has issued our 2018-2023 Strategic 
Plan for Serving the Congress and the Nation (See Enclosure II). As the 
United States confronts a series of new and long-standing challenges, 
GAO will rely on this latest strategic plan to guide our efforts to help make 
government more accountable, efficient, and effective and, ultimately, 
help improve the safety, security, and well-being of the American people. 
Our plan outlines a number of important drivers and trends that will shape 
GAO’s work in the coming years, in areas such as national security and 
defense, health care, and new developments in science and technology. 
GAO’s new plan consists of three components: 
  Goals and Objectives (GAO-18-1SP), 
  Key Efforts (GAO-18-395SP), and 
  Trends Affecting Government and Society (GAO-18-396SP). 
 
Page 20  GAO-18-426T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
This 3-part format enables the trends and key efforts to be updated 
periodically to reflect rapidly changing external forces and shifts in 
priorities. By periodically reviewing our plan, GAO will remain agile and 
responsive to the areas of greatest national concern and usefulness to 
the Congress and the public. Prior to issuance a draft was shared for 
comment by Congress, employees and external stakeholders. 
 
Center for Audit  The Congress authorized GAO to establish a Center for Audit Excellence 
(the Center) in 2014 to provide training and technical assistance to 
Excellence 
enhance the capacity of domestic and international accountability 
organizations. Although GAO contributes to a number of efforts that 
promote good governance and enhance accountability community 
capacity, the Center is unique in its ability to tackle complex training and 
capacity building projects because it can offer a wide range of services at 
locations throughout the world. The Center is authorized to charge fees 
for its services to facilitate recovery of its costs. 
Since the Center’s opening in October 2015, the Center has provided 
training or technical assistance services to nearly two dozen federal, 
state, local, and international organizations. The Center expanded its 
volume of work significantly between FY 2016 and FY 2017, collecting 
$41 thousand in fees in FY 2016, its first year of operation, and $345 
thousand in fiscal year 2017. The Center also signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding with the U.S. Agency for International Development, a key 
partner to the Center in promoting accountability among developing 
nations. 
During fiscal year 2017, the Center enhanced the capacity of 15 domestic 
and international accountability organizations. Domestically, the Center 
provided high quality training to promote greater understanding of 
Government Auditing Standards (the Yellow Book), internal control, 
performance auditing, report writing and other topics to five state and 
local audit offices, three federal audit organizations, and four other 
domestic audit organizations. Based on formal and informal feedback, the 
organizations and the vast majority of training participants found the 
training to be greatly useful. Moreover, several audit organizations have 
returned to the Center repeatedly for training and technical assistance to 
help their staff build capacity in applying auditing concepts and tools 
introduced in Center training classes. 
The Center also expanded its work and achieved positive impact in 
working with international accountability organizations in fiscal year 2017. 
Page 21  GAO-18-426T   
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Center provided training and technical assistance to a Supreme Audit 
Institution in Eastern Europe that enhanced its capacity to conduct 
information technology audits. The Center also worked with the 
Millennium Challenge Corporation to develop and start a project that is 
helping to enhance the capacity of a Supreme Audit Institution in Central 
America. Most recently, the Center worked with the US Agency for 
International Development to finalize an agreement for the Center to 
assess and identify ways to build the capacity of a Supreme Audit 
Institution and internal audit organization in an African country. 
The Center continues to implement its Business Plan and look for 
additional ways to build on the successes achieved and find additional 
ways to further strengthen the capacity of accountability partners to help 
enhance the oversight of U.S. federal funds used domestically and across 
the globe. For example, during fiscal year 2018, the Center plans to 
expand its international work further by leveraging its Memorandum of 
Understanding with USAID and building on outreach and partnerships 
with other organizations such as the World Bank. 
 
Concluding Remarks  We value the opportunity to provide Congress and the nation with timely, 
insightful analysis on the challenges facing the country. I would like to 
thank the Committee again for its support of GAO and the FY 2018 
Budget. Our FY 2019 budget requests the resources to ensure that we 
can continue to address the highest priorities of the Congress. 
Our request will allow us to continue building our staffing level and 
provide our employees with the appropriate resources and support 
needed to serve the Congress effectively. This funding level will also 
allow us to continue efforts to promote operational efficiency and address 
long-deferred information technology investments and maintenance. We 
will also continue to explore opportunities to generate revenue to help 
offset our costs. 
I appreciate, as always, your careful consideration of GAO’s budget and 
your continued support.

  Good afternoon, Chairman Moran, Ranking Member Shaheen and other distinguished 
Members of the Subcommittee. I am honored to appear before you today to present the 
President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 budget for the Department of Justice.   
 
Let me start by thanking you for your strong support for the Department in the recently 
completed FY 2018 Omnibus Appropriations bill. President Trump’s FY 2019 Budget proposal 
totals $28 billion for the Department of Justice to support federal law enforcement and the 
criminal justice priorities of our state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners.  The request 
represents a comprehensive investment in the Justice mission and includes increases in funding 
to help us reduce violent crime, enforce the nation’s immigration laws, combat the opioid 
epidemic, and continue our priority commitment to national security.   
 
The Department of Justice is facing a severe challenge. We must confront rising violent 
crime and surging homicide rates.  Illicit drug production and supplies are up worldwide.  Illicit 
drug prices are low, supplies are high, and purity is at record levels. This is true for the core 
dangerous drugs: fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine. In addition, the nation is 
beginning to make reductions in opioid prescriptions, and we must have further significant 
reductions in manufacturing and prescribing highly addictive opioids.  
Our DOJ team, along with our federal, state, and local partners, have high motivation and 
determination. We have been redeploying our resources this past year to focus directly on these 
problems. Let me say clearly, Mr. Chairman, you and this committee have been strongly 
supportive. We are determined to use every new dollar you have worked to provide us to achieve 
the maximum benefit in our efforts against these deadly drugs.  
  The President has ordered us to support state and local law enforcement, dismantle 
transnational organized crime, and reduce crime.  For the last year, we have aggressively carried 
out that agenda and have already seen notable successes that benefit the American people.  
 
The key Department funding priorities include: 
 
  Combating Violent Crime. The budget allocates an additional $109.2 million to support 
the President’s initiatives to reduce violent crime by targeting the worst of the worst 
transnational criminal organizations, violent gangs, and drug traffickers ravaging our 
nation.  A smart and sustained effort of this kind with our state and local partners will 
produce good results. 
  Drug Enforcement and the Opioid Crisis. The budget requests $295 million to combat 
the opioid epidemic that is destroying lives and whole communities. It will allow us to              
target the drug trafficking organizations, the drug companies, pharmacists, and 
pharmacies that are moving too many prescription drugs into America.  
  Enforcing Immigration Laws. This budget requests an additional $65.9 million to 
maintain the efficacy and efficiency of immigration enforcement and adjudication 
programs and processes.  Of note, this budget requests 75 new immigration judges (IJs) 
and support staff. Our goal is to responsibly end the lawlessness in our system and offer a 
lawful system that works to advance the national interest.  
  State, Local, and Tribal Assistance. The budget provides $3.9 billion in discretionary 
and mandatory funding for state, local, and tribal law enforcement assistance, who 
1 
 
 
comprise 85% of all law enforcement officers in America.  Critical programs aimed at 
protecting the life and safety of state and local law enforcement personnel, including the 
Public Safety Partnership Program and the Project Safe Neighborhood Program, 
demonstrate our continuing commitment to supporting state, local and tribal law 
enforcement.  
  Reprioritizing and reshaping resources for a more efficient Department.  In line with 
the President’s Executive Order on a “Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the 
Executive Branch,” we are committed to establishing a leaner federal government        
that reduces both bureaucracy and costs to the American taxpayer. The Department is 
proposing a number of initiatives to achieve savings, to reduce the size of government, 
and maximize agency performance.  
 
Combating Violent Crime   
 
  Protecting the American people from violent crime is a top priority for the Department of 
Justice. Unfortunately, in recent years, crime has been on the rise in too many places across the 
country. FBI statistics show that, in 2015 and 2016, the United States experienced the largest 
increases in violent crime in a quarter-century.1  Over those two years, violent crime increased 
by nearly 7%. Robberies, assaults, and rapes all increased, and homicide increased by a shocking 
20%.   
  In 2017, the Department made some great strides, including the launch of the enhanced 
Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) initiative, which brings together all levels of law enforcement 
and the communities they serve to develop effective, locally based strategies to reduce violent 
crime. Led by our 94 United States Attorney’s Offices, PSN task forces are hitting the streets 
across America to apprehend and bring violent criminals to justice.  I am asking Congress for 
additional PSN funding for Fiscal Year 2019, totaling $140 million, because I believe nothing 
will be more effective at reducing violent crime.   
 
  Under this program, I am asking a great deal of our United States Attorneys.  I am 
empowering them and holding them accountable for results.  To put them in the best position to 
impact and reduce violent crime, I have directed the re-allocation of resources and will be 
enlisting and deploying 300 additional violent crime prosecutors across the United States this 
year. So far, the Department has brought cases against the greatest number of violent criminals in 
at least 25 years—since the Department began tracking a “violent crime” category. Although 
preliminary numbers for 2017 show a decrease, violent crime rates are still excessively high.2   
 
  The FY 2019 budget also requests $109.2 million in program enhancements to reduce 
violent crime and combat transnational criminal organizations. These resources will enable the 
Department to dismantle the worst criminal organizations, target the most violent offenders, and 
protect the public. This includes increased funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
and Explosives’ (ATF) National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) in order to 
centralize the correlation process that enables ballistic identification services for law

enforcement partners in a more accurate, efficient and streamlined manner.  Further, it supports 
expediting ATF’s processing of National Firearms Act (NFA) applications, which will allow for 
technical advancements to ensure the most accurate and timely firearms registrations to support 
the enforcement of the NFA and provide certifications in support of criminal trials.  Finally, it 
will provide ATF additional resources to provide assistance to cities with surging firearms 
violence by augmenting and enhancing ATF’s regional Crime Gun Intelligence Centers.   
 
  It will also provide funding to the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Forces 
(OCDETF) with $4.6 million for the establishment of a Co-Located Strike Force to target those 
transnational criminal organizations that pose the greatest threat to our national security and the 
safety of American citizens.  The Criminal Division (CRM) is also requesting $13 million for 
Mutual Legal Assistance (MLAT) Reform.  This critical funding will support 37 attorneys and 
35 paralegals who support prosecutors domestically and abroad by navigating foreign laws, 
treaties, and other requirements, to secure the return of fugitives to face justice and to obtain the 
evidence needed to convict them.  The Office of International Affairs (OIA) often seek evidence 
needed to thwart terrorist plots or seek the removal of violent criminals hiding in America’s 
cities. Finally, the U.S. Marshals Service, the oldest American federal law enforcement agency 
tasked with apprehending dangerous and wanted fugitives, is seeking $7.3 million for the 
development and implementation of a comprehensive information technology (IT) integration 
project called the “Capture Initiative.”  This will consolidate operational data and improve 
business and mission capabilities at the headquarters and in the field, while ensuring their data is 
protected from cybersecurity risks. 
 
Drug Enforcement and the Opioid Crisis 
 
  The United States is in the midst of the deadliest drug epidemic in American history. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 63,600 
Americans died from drug overdoses in 2016, a 21% increase from the previous year.3 Over 
42,200, or approximately two-thirds, of these overdose deaths were caused by heroin, fentanyl, 
and prescription opioids. The President declared this scourge a National Public Health 
Emergency in October 2017, and the Department remains committed to doing its part to protect 
the American people from the impact of drugs and drug-related crime nationwide. 
 
  The FY 2019 budget requests $295 million in program enhancements and transfers for 
the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to combat the opioid crisis and bolster drug 
enforcement efforts. These resources will enable the Department to target those drug trafficking 
organizations most responsible for the opioid epidemic and drug-related violence in our 
communities, as well as ensure the life and safety of first responders who are on the front lines 
protecting the American people. 
   
  In FY 2017, Congress funded the establishment of six heroin enforcement teams, 
comprised of DEA Special Agents and state and local task force officers.  These teams have 
already begun to combat the trafficking in heroin, fentanyl analogues and the violence associated

with drug trafficking that is ravaging our communities.  DEA continues to aggressively pursue 
enforcement actions against international and domestic drug trafficking organizations, and in FY 
2019 we are seeking $31.2 million to fund an additional eight new heroin enforcement groups to 
be deployed to DEA Field Divisions that have identified heroin as the first or second greatest 
threat to their area.  The funding will also increase the number of DEA Special Agents at Field 
Divisions to target the Mexican Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) that pose the 
greatest drug threat to the United States.   
   
  Further, the FY 2019 request also supports $9.7 million for DEA to expand its Fentanyl 
Signature Profiling Program (FSPP) as it works to link fentanyl seizures to international and 
domestic trafficking networks responsible for fueling the opioid crisis.  It would also provide 
funding for DEA’s drug identification technology and personal protective equipment for agents 
in the field to minimize exposure to deadly opioids during enforcement actions and allow DEA 
to convert the El Salvador Formally Vetted Unit to a Sensitive Investigative Unit (SIU). 
 
  Finally, the President’s Budget proposes to permanently transfer $254 million to DEA 
from the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) for facilitating coordination of the 
High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program along with other drug enforcement 
assets.  Transferring the HIDTA grants to DEA will enable us to focus on combating drug 
trafficking in areas where the threat is the greatest and where there is a coordinated law 
enforcement presence.   
    
Enforce Immigration Laws 
 
  We are a strong, prosperous, and orderly nation and such a nation must have a lawful 
system of immigration.  Let no one contend that we reject immigration and want to “wall off 
America” from all lawful immigration.  We admit 1.1 million immigrants lawfully to permanent 
legal status—green card status—every year, the highest numbers in the world. Indeed, at this 
unprecedented rate we will soon have the largest percentage of non-native born in our nation’s 
history with the percentage continuing to rise every year thereafter. Thus, the good and decent 
people of this country are right to insist that this country should end the illegality, create a 
rational immigration flow, and protect the nation from criminal aliens. It cannot be that someone 
who illegally crosses the border and two days later arrives in Sacramento, Dubuque, Louisville, 
or Central Islip is home free—never to be removed. 
 
  It cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country 
with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits. Meanwhile those who 
engage in this process lawfully and patiently and wait their turn are disadvantaged. Our citizens, 
want our government to think about their needs and to consider their interests.  They have 
dreams too.  Immigration law is the province of the federal government.  This Administration 
and this Justice Department are determined to make it work fairly and effectively for the people.  
 
  The FY 2019 President’s Budget strengthens the Nation’s security through stronger 
enforcement of the Nation’s immigration laws.  The Department is requesting $65.9 million in 
immigration-related program enhancements for FY 2019, which will enhance border security and 
immigration enforcement.  These investments will also improve our ability to conduct 
4 
 
 
immigration hearings to help combat illegal immigration to the United States by expanding 
capacity, improving efficiency, and removing impediments to the timely administration of 
justice.  This budget supports the Department’s efforts, along with our partners at the Department 
of Homeland Security, to fix our immigration system. 
 
  The Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) oversees the Nation’s immigration 
courts and the Board of Immigrant Appeals.  At the beginning of FY 2018, there were nearly 
650,000 cases pending nationwide, a 25 percent increase from FY 2016 and by far the largest 
pending caseload before the agency, marking the eleventh consecutive year of increased 
backlogs.  To maintain efficacy and efficiency of immigration enforcement and adjudication 
programs, the Department’s request includes $39.8 million for 75 new immigration judges (IJs) 
and support staff.  Further, $25 million is included in this request for EOIR to modernize its 
wholly paper-based case-related system to provide for electronic submission of all case-related 
information, establish Record of Proceedings (eROP), establish electronic case adjudicatory aids 
for IJs, improve its case management processes and end-to-end workflow, and eventually 
transition to a paperless courtroom.   
   
State, Local, and Tribal Assistance 
 
  Federal law enforcement officers constitute only 15% of the total number of law 
enforcement officers nationwide; therefore, 85% of the officer support relies upon strong 
partnership with state and local law enforcement.  The Department supports its partners in state 
and local law enforcement, who have critical intelligence about violent crime in their 
communities, and whose actions are crucial in the fight against violent crime and the opioid 
epidemic.  The FY 2019 Budget continues its commitment to state, local and tribal law 
enforcement by investing approximately $3.9 billion in discretionary and mandatory funding in 
programs to assist them.  Funding has been prioritized to meet the most pressing law 
enforcement concerns – violent crime and opioid abuse – and to help the victims of crime.   
 
  We are also confronting the state and local jurisdictions that have undertaken to undo our 
immigration laws through so-called “sanctuary policies.” Such policies undermine the moral 
authority of law and undermine the safety of the jurisdictions that adopt them.  Police are forced 
to release criminal aliens back into the community—no matter what their crimes.  Think about 
that: Police may be forced to release pedophiles, rapists, murderers, drug dealers, and arsonists 
back into the communities where they had no right to be in the first place.  They should—
according to law and common sense—be processed and deported. These policies hinder the work 
of federal law enforcement; they are contrary to the rule of law, and they have serious 
consequences. 
   
  Sanctuary jurisdictions feign outrage when they lose federal funds as a direct result of 
actions which contradict federal law.  Some have even decided to go to court so that they can 
keep receiving taxpayer-funded grants while continuing to impede federal immigration 
enforcement.  We intend to fight this resolutely. We cannot continue giving federal grants to 
cities that actively undermine the safety of federal law officers and intentionally frustrate efforts 
to reduce crime in their own cities. These jurisdictions that knowingly, willfully, and 
purposefully release criminal aliens back into their communities are sacrificing the lives and 
5 
 
 
safety of American citizens in the pursuit of an extreme open borders policy. It is extreme, 
because if a jurisdiction will not deport someone who enters illegally and then commits another 
crime, then who will they deport?  
 
  This is not just a bad policy; it is a direct challenge to the laws of the United States.  It 
places the lives of our fine law enforcement officers at risk ; I cannot and will not accept this 
increased risk because certain elected officials want to make a statement. Our duty is to protect 
public safety and protect taxpayer dollars and I plan to fulfill those duties.  
 
Restructuring Initiatives 
 
  The Administration is committed to establishing a leaner, more productive federal 
government that reduces both, bureaucracy and costs to the American taxpayer. Since 2017, the 
Department of Justice has undertaken efforts to refocus resources and return our efforts to our 
core mission.  To support the President’s Executive Order on reorganizing the Executive Branch, 
the Department of Justice has begun taking steps to streamline and improve its good stewardship 
of taxpayers’ dollars. As part of the FY 2019 President’s Budget, the Department is proposing a 
number of initiatives to achieve savings, to reduce the size of government, and maximize agency 
performance.  Highlights of the restructuring initiatives include:  
 
  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ (ATF) responsibilities related 
to alcohol and tobacco enforcement will transfer to the Department of Treasury’s Alcohol 
and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.  ATF will retain its current enforcement 
responsibilities for firearms and explosives, while re-focusing their resources on violent 
crime. As part of that, ATF will pursue a workforce refresh effort, leveraging attrition 
from its retirement-eligible workforce to reinvigorate a cadre of Special Agents and 
Investigators to work on ATF’s violent crime initiatives.   
 
  The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) will shift to historical inmate-to-staff ratios.  It will also 
close two Regional Offices and two stand-alone minimum-security prison camps, which 
is anticipated to achieve over $122 million in savings.   
 
  Beginning in FY 2018, the Department will merge administrative support and certain 
grant management staff for the three Department grant offices. These grants benefit our 
state and local partners who are on the front lines fighting crime and battling the opioid 
crisis.  The Department plans to build one grants management system to streamline the 
grants process. As part of this effort in FY 2019, the Department will consolidate the 
Office of Community Oriented Policing (COPS) into the Bureau of Justice Assistance at 
the Office of Justice Programs (OJP).   
 
  The budget also proposes to transfer the Community Relations Service (CRS) to the Civil 
Rights Division, who will then be able to perform its community mediation work in a 
more centralized manner and at a greater savings to the taxpayer.    
 
  Finally as previously noted, the HIDTA grant program will transfer from ONDCP to 
DEA.  This change will eliminate redundancies within federal organizations by 
6 
 
 
reallocating this program, which supports states and communities fighting the scourge of 
illegal drugs, into the same agency leading the enforcement efforts in those communities. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Chairman Moran, Ranking Member Shaheen and Members of the Subcommittee, it is my 
pleasure to highlight our efforts to be good stewards of the resources and authorities bestowed on 
us as we strengthen the Department’s ability to ensure safety, equality, and justice for all 
Americans.  As Attorney General, I am committed to making the Department of Justice run as 
efficiently and effectively as possible, without adding to the burden of the American taxpayer.  I 
thank you for your past support of the Department’s financial needs, and for the opportunity to 
present our FY 2019 budget request.  I look forward to working with you through the upcoming 
fiscal year to ensure that the Department of Justice remains on solid financial footing and can 
accomplish its multiple and varied missions effectively.

WRITTEN STATEMENT 
BY KRISTINE L. SVINICKI, CHAIRMAN 
UNITED STATES NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 
TO THE 
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT 
APRIL 25, 2018 
 
Good afternoon Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Feinstein, and distinguished members 
of the Subcommittee. My colleagues and I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you to 
discuss the U.S Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC) Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 budget 
request. 
 
The NRC is an independent Federal agency established to regulate commercial nuclear power 
plants; research and test reactors; nuclear fuel cycle facilities; and radioactive materials used in 
medicine, academia, and for industrial purposes. The agency also regulates the transport, 
storage, and disposal of radioactive materials and waste and the export and import of 
radioactive materials.  
 
The agency’s statutory mission is to license and regulate the civilian use of radioactive materials 
in the United States, to ensure adequate protection of public health and safety, and to promote 
the common defense and security. The FY 2019 budget request reflects the agency’s continued 
commitment to improving effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability, including increasing the 
use of risk information in regulatory decision-making. 
  
The NRC’s FY 2019 budget request, including resources for the NRC’s Office of Inspector 
General (OIG), is $970.7 million. The FY 2019 request represents an overall increase of $48.7 
million, including an increase of 61 full-time equivalent employees (FTE) compared with the FY 
2018 enacted budget. This requested increase in resources is largely tied to the proposed 
1 
 
activities related to the license application (construction permit) for the Yucca Mountain deep 
geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste and for further 
development of the regulatory infrastructure necessary to review advanced nuclear reactor 
technologies. 
 
In FY 2019, the NRC proposes to recover $815.4 million of the requested FY 2019 budget from 
fees assessed to NRC licensees. This will result in a net appropriation of $155.3 million, with 
$47.7 million to be derived from the Nuclear Waste Fund, which is an increase of $23.7 million 
in net appropriations compared with the FY 2018 enacted budget. The requested increase is 
primarily the result of activities related to Yucca Mountain licensing, which are not fee-billable 
and must be recovered from the Nuclear Waste Fund, and the development of capabilities and 
tools for the review of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. We are still in the process of 
assessing the impacts of the enacted budget on individual program areas, so the budget 
comparisons in the remainder of this testimony will be to the FY 2018 annualized continuing 
resolution. 
 
Before discussing the specifics of the NRC’s FY 2019 budget request, I’ll discuss several key 
issues being addressed by the Commission. 
 
Yucca Mountain 
The NRC continues to provide monthly updates to Congress on its activities in response to the 
decision issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in In re Aiken 
County, focusing on our efforts to spend most effectively the limited remaining unobligated 
carryover funds appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund to continue with the licensing 
processes for Yucca Mountain. As part of those efforts the agency has completed the remaining 
2 
 
four volumes of its safety evaluation report and a supplement to the Department of Energy’s 
Environmental Impact Statement. 
 
In February of this year, the Licensing Support Network Advisory Review Panel (LSNARP) 
conducted a public meeting with stakeholders, including the state of Nevada, in order to 
provide information to and gather input from advisory panel members and the public regarding 
a suitable replacement or possible reconstitution of the Licensing Support Network (LSN). The 
LSN was originally established by the NRC to provide access via the internet to documents 
associated with Yucca Mountain licensing proceedings and activities. LSNARP members 
and members of the public were provided an opportunity to submit additional written 
comments regarding matters discussed at the meeting by the end of March. After all of 
the comments have been reviewed, the NRC staff will provide the Commission options for 
reconstituting the LSN or developing a suitable replacement system for accessing the 
related documents should the Yucca Mountain licensing adjudication resume in the 
future. 
 
Efficiency and Effectiveness  
Several years ago, the NRC initiated a strategic initiative to “right size” the agency and its 
budget. This work has resulted in reductions in the NRC’s budget and staff. From 2014 to the 
proposed FY 2019 request, excluding high level waste activities, we have reduced our budget 
by 13% from $1.1 billion to $970.7 million. The number of FTE has been reduced from around 
3,800 to about 3,250. The NRC identified 150 agency-wide activities to discontinue or perform 
with fewer resources. Of these, 149 tasks have been completed and the remaining task is on 
schedule. The agency’s current efforts to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability 
3 
 
go beyond previous efforts and the FY 2019 budget reflects additional opportunities to transform 
agency processes and increase the use of risk information in regulatory decision-making. 
 
The NRC’s ability to innovate will facilitate our long-term success in ensuring the safe and 
secure use of nuclear materials in the 21st century. In January of this year, the agency’s 
Executive Director for Operations established an NRC Transformation Team to identify potential 
transformative changes to the NRC’s regulatory framework, culture, and infrastructure. This 
team has been engaging a variety of sources both internal and external to the NRC, including 
the nuclear industry, non-governmental organizations, public organizations, private companies, 
and federal agencies such as the Department of Transportation and the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration. Ultimately, the team will recommend specific areas for transformative 
initiatives for Commission consideration.  
 
New Small Modular Reactors and Advanced Reactors 
We received the first application for certification of a small modular reactor (SMR) from NuScale 
at the beginning of 2017. The agency also is reviewing an early site permit application from the 
Tennessee Valley Authority for two or more SMR modules at the Clinch River site in Roane 
County, Tennessee. We anticipate starting additional SMR pre-application reviews in FY 2019 
and beginning one or more advanced reactor application reviews in the next two to four years. 
 
Congressional Budget Justification Improvements 
Improvements in the FY 2019 Congressional Budget Justification include increasing 
transparency by including a statement regarding how the budgeted resources impact fees in 
each programmatic business line. In addition, the NRC’s Congressional Budget Justification 
includes the Annual Performance Plan, which provides the performance goals as well as 
4 
 
performance indicators and criteria associated with the goals and objectives established in the 
agency’s strategic plan. 
 
FY 2019 Budget Request 
I would now like to highlight specific elements of the FY 2019 budget request. 
 
Nuclear Reactor Safety 
The NRC’s Nuclear Reactor Safety Program encompasses licensing and oversight of civilian 
nuclear power, research and test reactors, and medical isotope production facilities in a manner 
that adequately protects public health and safety. This program also provides reasonable 
assurance of the security of facilities and protection against radiological sabotage. This program 
contributes to the NRC’s safety and security strategic goals through the activities of the 
Operating Reactors and New Reactors Business Lines that regulate existing and new nuclear 
reactors to ensure their safe and secure operation. 
 
Overall resources requested in the FY 2019 budget for Nuclear Reactor Safety are $474.8 
million, including 1,925 FTE. This represents an overall funding increase of $25.8 million, yet 
includes a decrease of 123 FTE, when compared with the FY 2018 annualized continuing 
resolution (CR). The increase in the Operating Reactors Business Line is largely a result of 
research activities funded with authorized prior year unobligated carryover in FY 2017 and 
reflects a change to the fund source. In addition, salaries and benefits increased in FY 2018. 
This budget also includes $10.3 million for the continued development of a regulatory 
infrastructure for advanced nuclear reactor technologies. The budget request reflects ongoing 
work on the agency plan to merge the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation and the Office of 
New Reactors by 2020. 
 
5 
 
Operating Reactors 
 
The Operating Reactors Business Line portion of the Nuclear Reactor Safety Program 
encompasses the regulation of 99 operating civilian nuclear power reactors and 31 research 
and test reactors. The NRC is requesting $375.6 million for operating reactors, including 1,531 
FTE, which represents an overall funding increase of $21.8 million from the FY 2018 annualized 
CR. The increase in resources is largely a result of research activities funded using authorized 
prior year unobligated carryover in FY 2017. In addition, resources increase to support the 
following activities: (1) potassium iodide replenishment for nine States; (2) continued 
development of accident-tolerant fuel (ATF) licensing framework; (3) review of one new 
subsequent license renewal (SLR) application (Surry nuclear power plant in Surry, Virginia) and 
the continuing review of two SLR applications (Peach Bottom in Delta, PA and Turkey Point in 
Homestead, FL); (4) increased risk-informed licensing activities and license amendment 
requests, work related to the risk-informed steering committee, and knowledge management 
and training to support increasing the staff’s capabilities to use risk information in decision-
making; (5) research activities on safety and security of digital systems, materials degradation, 
cable aging, and concrete degradation; (6) increased workload to consolidate high-performance 
computing services and migration to the cloud; and (7) increased workload to enhance the 
Replacement Reactor Program System (R-RPS) to support new reactor inspection/licensing 
and regulatory changes and functionality currently provided by various new reactor systems. 
 
These increases are partially offset by decreases resulting from (1) a reduction in Fukushima 
Near-Term Task Force “Tier 1” work related to the agency’s Mitigating Strategies Order, 
reevaluations of flooding and seismic hazards, and the Hardened Vents Order, as well as the 
completion of “Tier 2” and “Tier 3” work; (2) a reduction in license renewal inspections; (3) a 
reduction in force-on-force inspections due to additional plants entering decommissioning; (4) 
6 
 
the closure of the Fort Calhoun Station near Omaha, NE; (5) the re-baselining of agency 
resources; and (6) a reduced workload to implement the R-RPS and maintain legacy RPS (to be 
decommissioned in FY 2018).  
 
New Reactors 
The New Reactors Business Line portion of the Nuclear Reactor Safety Program is responsible 
for licensing and overseeing the design, siting, and construction of new nuclear power reactors, 
including SMRs and advanced reactors. The new reactors activities ensure that new civilian 
nuclear power reactor facilities are developed in a manner that protects the health, safety, and 
security of the public in an efficient manner. 
 
The FY 2019 budget request for new reactors is $99.1 million, including 394 FTE, a funding 
increase of $3.9 million, yet includes a decrease of 61 FTE, when compared with the FY 2018 
annualized CR.  
 
The NRC continues to interact with vendors about prospective SMRs and advanced reactor 
applications. Additionally, we will continue to refine our regulatory processes as we prepare to 
review these potential applications.  
 
During FY 2019, we will continue to review reactor design certification applications for NuScale 
(SMR) and U.S. APWR (a large light water reactor); conduct licensing reviews for Blue Castle 
Holdings, Inc. and Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems, and conduct an early site permit 
review for the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Clinch River Nuclear Site. Additional resources will 
be allocated to support the potential application review and construction oversight for two 
reactors at the Bellefonte Nuclear Station near Scottsboro, AL. The NRC also will continue 
7 
 
conducting inspections at the two reactors under construction at Vogtle Electric Generating 
Plant in Waynesboro, GA. 
 
Nuclear Materials and Waste Safety 
The Nuclear Materials and Waste Safety Program is responsible for licensing, regulating, and 
overseeing nuclear materials in a manner that adequately protects the public health and safety. 
Through this program, the NRC regulates uranium processing and fuel facilities, research and 
pilot facilities, and other nuclear materials licensees such as medical, industrial, research, and 
academic uses. Additionally, through this program, the NRC regulates spent fuel storage, spent 
fuel and material transportation and packaging, decontamination and decommissioning of 
facilities, and low-level and high-level radioactive waste activities. The FY 2019 budget request 
for this program is $183.7 million, including 650 FTE. This funding level represents an overall 
funding increase of $46.8 million, including an increase of 82 FTE, when compared with the FY 
2018 annualized CR budget. This increase is due to $47.7 million, including 124 FTE, for work 
on the license application (construction permit) for the proposed Yucca Mountain deep geologic 
repository for spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste that was not included in 
the FY 2018 annualized CR. 
 
Fuel Facilities 
The Fuel Facilities Business Line portion of the Nuclear Materials and Waste Safety Program is 
responsible for ensuring that fuel cycle facilities are licensed and operated in a manner that 
adequately protects public health and safety and promotes the common defense and security. 
The FY 2019 budget request for fuel facilities is $25.2 million, including 107 FTE, which 
represents a funding increase of $0.5 million, and a decrease of 6 FTE, when compared with 
the FY 2018 annualized CR.  
8 
 
 
Nuclear Materials Users 
The Nuclear Materials Users Business Line portion of the Nuclear Materials and Waste Safety 
Program supports the licensing and oversight necessary to ensure the safe and secure 
processing and handling of nuclear materials. The FY 2019 budget request for nuclear materials 
activities is $60.6 million, including 215 FTE, a funding decrease of $2.9 million and a decrease 
of 23 FTE compared with the FY 2018 annualized CR.  
 
Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation 
The Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation Business Line portion of the Nuclear Materials and 
Waste Safety Program supports the safe and secure storage of spent fuel and the safe and 
secure transport of radioactive materials. These activities include licensing, oversight, 
rulemaking, international activities, research, and generic homeland security.  
 
The FY 2019 budget request for spent fuel and transportation is $24.8 million, including 100 
FTE, a funding increase of $2.5 million and a decrease of 2 FTE when compared with the FY 
2018 annualized CR. Resources increase primarily under the Licensing Product Line to support 
safety, security, emergency preparedness, and environmental reviews for two concurrent 
applications for a consolidated interim storage facility; the effort to update/consolidate the 
standard review plan; anticipated legal activities; and to support Independent Spent Fuel 
Storage Installation license renewals. 
 
In February, the NRC formally docketed an application by Holtec, Inc. to construct and operate a 
consolidated interim storage facility for spent fuel from commercial nuclear power reactors in Lea 
County, New Mexico. Holtec seeks to store up to 8,680 metric tons of uranium in commercial 
spent fuel at the site in underground storage systems for a 40-year license term. 
9 
 
 
The other application for a consolidated interim storage facility was submitted by Waste Control 
Specialists (WSC) to build and operate a facility near Andrews, Texas.  That application was 
docketed for review in January 2017, but the review was suspended in April 2017 at the 
applicant’s request.  Recently, WCS announced its intent to request that the NRC staff resume 
its review.  
 
Decommissioning and Low-Level Waste 
The Decommissioning and Low-Level Waste (LLW) Business Line portion of the Nuclear 
Materials and Waste Safety Program supports licensing and oversight associated with the safe 
and secure operation of uranium recovery facilities, decommissioning of nuclear facilities, and 
disposition of low-level radioactive waste from all civilian sources. The FY 2019 budget request 
for decommissioning and LLW is $25.4 million, including 104 FTE, an overall funding decrease 
of $1.0 million and a decrease of 11.0 FTE when compared with the FY 2018 annualized CR.  
 
The FY 2019 budget request provides funding for a number of major activities to include 
oversight of the national LLW management program and monitoring of the Department of 
Energy’s waste-incidental-to-reprocessing determinations and related disposal actions at the 
Savannah River Site and the Idaho National Laboratory. Other noteworthy LLW activities 
include decommissioning activities for two research reactors and 20 power reactors. 
 
Under the Licensing Product Line, fewer resources are needed because of the expected decline 
in workload resulting from Wyoming’s anticipated transition to Agreement State status in late 
calendar year 2018. When this agreement is approved and implemented, the NRC will 
discontinue its regulatory authority over certain uranium and thorium milling activities and 
10 
 
transfer regulatory authority and related licenses to the State of Wyoming. Currently, 
approximately 70 percent of NRC-licensed uranium recovery facilities are located in the State of 
Wyoming. Additionally, resources decrease to reflect the expected workload decline with the 
non-military radium program. These decreases are partially offset by increases to support 
various rulemaking activities, including the Greater-Than-Class-C and Transuranic Waste 
rulemakings. 
 
High-Level Waste 
The High-Level Waste Business Line portion of the Nuclear Materials and Waste Safety 
Program supports the NRC’s activities for the proposed Yucca Mountain deep geologic 
repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste using 
appropriations from the Nuclear Waste Fund. The FY 2019 budget request for high-level waste 
is $47.7 million, including 124 FTE. FY 2019 resources would include support to the 
adjudicatory proceeding; infrastructure activities for information technology capabilities; 
rulemakings associated with the geologic repository operations area; and related support 
activities such as acquisitions, recruitment, and staffing. 
 
Corporate Support 
The NRC’s corporate support involves centrally managed activities that include acquisitions, 
administrative services, financial management, human resource management, information 
technology and information management, training, outreach, and policy support. The FY 2019 
resources requested for corporate support constitute 31 percent of the agency’s total budget 
and reflect an overall increase of $1.5 million, yet include a decrease of 108 FTE, when 
compared with the FY 2018 annualized CR. The FY 2019 budget request supports the NRC’s 
continued efforts to modernize IT to increase productivity and security, improve the efficiency 
11 
 
and effectiveness of administrative services, develop a workforce for the 21st century, focus on 
the highest-value work, and improve customer service. Resources increase in FY 2019 primarily 
as a result of investments in IT and an increase in salaries and benefits in FY 2018. 
 
Office of Inspector General 
The NRC’s OIG is a statutory entity whose mission is to independently and objectively audit and 
investigate programs and operations to promote effectiveness and efficiency, and to prevent 
and detect fraud, waste, and abuse. The FY 2019 budget request for the NRC OIG is $12.6 
million, which includes approximately $11 million in salaries and benefits to support 63 FTE, and 
$1.6 million in program support. These resources will support Inspector General auditing and 
investigation functions for both the NRC ($11.5 million) and the Defense Nuclear Facilities 
Safety Board ($1.1 million). 
 
FY 2018 Proposed Fee Rule 
I would like to turn to some key elements of the fees for FY2018. The NRC adjusts its licensing, 
inspection, special project, and annual fees charged to its applicants and licensees each year. 
These adjustments are necessary to implement the requirements of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Act requires the NRC to recover approximately 90 percent of its 
annual budget through fees. Certain items like the Nuclear Waste Fund, generic homeland 
security activities, waste incidental to reprocessing, advanced reactor regulatory infrastructure 
development, international activities, and Inspector General services to the Defense Nuclear 
Facilities Safety Board are excluded from the fee-recoverable portion of the budget. 
 
The NRC proposed to collect $826.7 million in fees in the proposed FY 2018 Fee Rule.  
However, based on the recently enacted appropriations bills, the NRC now anticipates needing 
12 
 
to collect approximately $790.3 million in fees for FY 2018. 
 
The fees are collected by two primary methods. Licensees are charged an annual fee or directly 
billed for services including license amendments, license renewals, and inspections. In setting 
the fees each year, the NRC uses the most recent four quarters of licensee activity and 
additional information from licensees regarding plans to conduct significant work to project the 
expected amount of work that will be directly billed during the fiscal year. The remaining portion 
of the fee-recoverable budget is collected through annual fees assessed to each licensee. 
 
The public comment period for the proposed FY 2018 Fee Rule ended on February 26, 2018. 
The agency has received input from a number of industry stakeholders expressing concerns 
with increasing fees, particularly in areas where the number of licensees are declining (e.g., 
uranium recovery, fuel facilities, and operating reactors). We are mindful of the impact on fees, 
particularly as the number of licensees declines within a fee category. Our goal is to ensure that 
our fees are equitable, fair, and transparent. We monitor such declines and seek to mitigate the 
impact on the remaining facilities, where possible. We are also committed to continuing to 
examine and adapt our fee structure within the bounds of our authority to do so in response to a 
changing industry. 
 
CLOSING 
In closing, safety and security have always been the main focus of the NRC.  This budget 
request reflects our continuing efforts to achieve additional efficiencies while maintaining 
reasonable assurance of adequate protection of public health and safety and the security of our 
nation.

Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Feinstein, and distinguished Members of the 
Subcommittee, this concludes my written testimony. On behalf of the Commission, I thank you 
for the opportunity to appear before you. Thank you also for your support of the vital mission of 
the NRC. We would be pleased to respond to your questions.

U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Mark Green 
Testimony on the Fiscal Year 2019 Budget Request 
 
Introduction 
 
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, Members of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to 
discuss USAID’s FY 2019 Budget Request.   
 
The Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 request for USAID fully and partially managed accounts is 
approximately $16.8 billion.  This represents $1.3 billion more than requested last year.  It 
requests $6.7 billion for global health and $5.1 billion for economic support and development.  
In terms of USAID’s humanitarian assistance, it requests over $1 billion more than last fiscal 
year’s request.  In total, it requests approximately $3.6 billion for International Disaster 
Assistance. 
 
Meeting Priorities 
 
Since I arrived at USAID in August, I had a chance to meet with many of you.  We discussed 
many of the challenges in the world today, and you shared with me your priorities.  Since then, 
we’ve been hard at work at USAID to advance those shared priorities and position the Agency 
for its crucial role in U.S. foreign policy.   
 
Our work has been informed by many of the travels I have undertaken, meeting our teams and 
partners around the world.  I have traveled to Ethiopia, Sudan, and South Sudan, where I saw 
USAID leading the world’s response to the continuing humanitarian need in East Africa.  In 
Ethiopia, I also saw our efforts to foster resilience to help that country withstand the future crises 
that very likely will come. 
 
I have traveled to Mexico and India, where I met with our partners from both the public and 
private sectors.  It was there that I saw glimpses of an exciting future for international 
development, where programs are more private-enterprise driven and our role is increasingly to 
use our skills, experience, and innovative know-how to help countries chart their own journeys to 
self-reliance and prosperity.    
 
In Iraq and Syria, I met with some of our military leaders.  Together, we toured Raqqa, and I 
learned more about USAID’s joint effort with the State Department and Defense Department to 
restore essential services to communities newly liberated from ISIS.  In Switzerland, the United 
Kingdom, and Germany, I met with international partners, including a senior leader from Israel's 
Foreign Ministry, to share some of the new innovations in programing and policy we are 
applying to our work in development and humanitarian assistance, and to discuss areas of future 
1 
 
 
cooperation.  I also took the opportunity to encourage our fellow donors to take on a greater role 
in helping to meet the world’s growing needs.   
 
In Germany, I met with our Mission Directors from the Middle East and Africa -- as well as their 
counterparts from the State Department and DOD -- to discuss how we can strengthen 
interagency cooperation.  At the Munich Security Conference, I heard Vitali Klitschko, the 
Mayor of Kiev, speak about Ukraine’s fight for freedom and democracy.  I was reminded that 
we, too, were once a young nation inspired by the hope of a democratic future, but also 
confronted by numerous challenges as we strived to build our republic.  As I listened to 
Klitschko, I was immensely proud of the work that USAID does to support people, all around the 
world, like him and the heads of the Euromaidan movement who aspire to freedom and citizen-
responsive governance.   
 
In February, we announced USAID’s new Mission Statement.  It includes an explicit 
commitment to strengthening democratic governance abroad -- a priority that I know from our 
discussions you share.  This commitment has informed USAID’s work from our creation; and 
under my leadership, it will continue to do so.  Our FY 2019 Request includes targeted 
investments in Europe and Eurasia that will support strong, democratic institutions and vibrant 
civil society, while countering the Kremlin’s influence in the region.  In Venezuela, we will 
support those who are working for a free and prosperous future.  We have requested robust 
funding for our democracy and governance programs in Venezuela that support civil society, the 
democratically elected legislature, and a free flow of information there.  And in FY 2019, we 
have requested funds to explore and implement more effective approaches to promoting ethnic 
and religious tolerance in Burma, including in Rakhine and Kachin States, and to help meet the 
needs of minorities in Iraq ravaged by ISIS, including those targeted because of their faith.  
 
I have also met with people from across these United States.  I have been to New York, Texas, 
Delaware, Iowa, and even my home state of Wisconsin.  I have met with the Chamber of 
Commerce Foundation and spoken with business leaders, CEOs of American firms.  All of them 
are eager to find ways to align with and enhance USAID’s work, as well as invest in the rapidly 
growing markets that are most often the targets of our programing.  I have met with researchers 
from American universities who are helping us tackle devastating challenges like the Fall 
Armyworm in Africa.  I have also met with American implementing partners -- contractors and 
grantees, faith-based organizations and for-profits -- to explore ways we can improve our 
operations.  
 
On top of all that, I have been “traveling” internally, leading a broad agency Transformation 
effort through which we are re-examining nearly every aspect of our operations and structures in 
order to make sure we are as effective, efficient, and accountable to American taxpayers as 
possible. 
2 
 
 
 
Overview: A Fiscally Responsible Budget for Challenging Times 
 
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members, this is the first time I have had the honor of 
presenting the President's Budget.  However, it is not the first time we have met with your offices 
to review the needs we see in the humanitarian and development sectors.  We have also reached 
out to you and your staff to discuss our growing work in conflict, post-conflict, and otherwise 
fragile zones.  I note that this Request would fund important efforts, such as the urgent work we 
are undertaking to help communities newly-liberated from ISIS’s evil reign by restoring essential 
services to places like Raqqa.  
 
We acknowledge that this Budget Request will not provide enough resources for us to meet 
every humanitarian need or seize every international development opportunity.  In truth, no 
federal budget in recent memory would be large enough to do so, and we would not suggest it 
wise to try to do so.  We come to you with a Budget Request that aims to balance fiscal 
responsibility here at home with our leadership role and national security imperatives on the 
world stage.   
 
Optimizing Resources and Results 
 
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members, we are committed to taking every prudent step 
to extend the reach and effectiveness of our taxpayer resources.  We are working closely with the 
Department of State to encourage other donor nations and recipient countries themselves to 
increase their own contributions to the overall humanitarian and development effort.  This 
includes efforts at strengthening domestic resource mobilization programs so that partners can 
more effectively finance their own development in the future.  We are rethinking and 
streamlining our humanitarian assistance.  We are taking steps to ensure our programs and 
procedures are more private enterprise-friendly so we can better leverage our resources, bring 
new ideas and partners to our work, and increase opportunities for American businesses.  
Through procurement reform, we are striving to become more flexible, and responsive and 
innovative in meeting humanitarian and development objectives, so our implementing partners 
can extend and improve the reach of USAID-supported initiatives.  We are also striving to more 
closely align our resources with USG strategic needs, and are focused on measurement and 
evaluation to support that alignment.  Finally, we are using the opportunity of our 
Transformation to ensure that our programs are of the highest quality and fully reflective of 
America’s key foreign policy priorities.  
 
 
 
 
3 
 
 
Encouraging Others to Do More 
 
As the President has said, “America first does not mean America alone.”  We can and do 
embrace opportunities to partner with others and we expect others to do their part in tackling 
challenges that affect us all.  Working with the State Department, we are using every opportunity 
to push our donor partners to do more in helping to mobilize resources -- including increasing 
their financial contributions.    
 
To put things in context, in 2016, the U.S. provided nearly $34.5 billion in Official Development 
Assistance (ODA), almost one quarter of all ODA.  In terms of humanitarian assistance, the U.S. 
continues to be the largest single donor. Our leadership role as a donor is a point of pride.  It is 
part of our national character -- our readiness to stand with other countries and peoples when 
crisis strikes.  But leadership also means leading others to do more and setting the expectation 
that other donors will do their fair share to advance shared priorities, while also expecting 
improved performance by implementing partners, including the U.N., to maximize the benefit for 
recipients of assistance. 
 
We’ve recently seen a number of key allies increase their ODA contributions.  For example, the 
Republic of Korea has contributed significant amounts to shared priorities like Power Africa, 
global health security, and humanitarian assistance to Syria.  It has increased its aid budget by 30 
percent, a feat recently matched by the United Kingdom.  Germany has become one of the 
world’s leading humanitarian assistance donors, providing a record $2 billion in 2017 to assist 
people from places like Syria, Yemen, the Sahel, and Burma.  And India, which not so long ago 
was itself a major recipient of traditional assistance like food aid, is boosting its contributions to 
key initiatives.  Under Prime Minister Modi, India has become the fifth-largest donor to 
development and reconstruction in Afghanistan. 
 
Domestic Resource-Mobilization 
 
Another way in which we are working to make our resources go further is through our support 
for domestic resource-mobilization (“DRM”) projects.  Through DRM, we help strengthen the 
capacity of our partner nations to finance and lead their own development programs.  The Budget 
requests $75 million for strategically-managed DRM assistance.  From the date of my 
nomination hearing, and nearly every day since, I have said I believe the purpose of foreign 
assistance must be ending its need to exist.  Our assistance should be designed to empower 
people, communities, and government leaders on their journey to self-reliance and prosperity.  
These initiatives can help our partners to cut down on fraud, corruption, and abuse.  They will 
also ensure that our investments produce sustainable results; they will ensure that our partners’ 
ability to respond to the needs of their citizens will not fade away as our formal government 
support recedes gradually.  
4 
 
 
 
Our DRM assistance in the nation of Georgia is a good example of what can be achieved.  
USAID provided DRM assistance of $12 million to Georgia over five years.  The result was an 
additional $4 billion in tax revenue from 2005 to 2011.  By 2017, revenue had increased by 800 
percent.  As part of this effort, we helped streamline Georgia’s customs process and make it 
easier for new businesses to register.  We supported efforts that created an electronic tax-filing 
system and fixed crippling flaws in the Georgian tax refund process.  We also took steps to help 
them cut down on corruption -- encouraging “zero tolerance” policies, harsher punishments for 
violators, and new training programs.   
 
Georgia’s investment in their own development also grew.  Pension and social-welfare spending 
increased by 700 percent.  Education investment grew by 1,700 percent.  Their government even 
introduced a crop-insurance program.  In other words, through our DRM assistance, we helped 
an important partner accelerate its own journey to self-reliance and prosperity. 
 
Strengthening Humanitarian Assistance  
 
In Yemen, 17.8 million people -- the largest number in the world -- are facing severe food 
insecurity.  In January alone, USAID’s partner the World Food Programme provided critical 
food assistance to more than 6.8 million people.  In February, after sustained high-level 
diplomatic engagement by the Department of State, USAID-funded mobile cranes became 
operational in Yemen’s biggest and most critical port.  These cranes are cutting the average time 
it takes to unload ships by as much as half, allowing food, medicine, and other necessities to 
reach people in need more quickly. 
 
Providing humanitarian assistance in places like Yemen is central to our Agency’s Mission, and 
a clear display of American generosity.  It is also dangerous work, as witnessed by the January 
terrorist attack on Save the Children’s offices in Afghanistan, in which four of our partners were 
brutally murdered, or the 28 aid workers who were killed in South Sudan during 2017.  Our 
commitment to this work is reflected by the inclusion of our international disaster assistance to 
help alleviate humanitarian crises in our new Mission Statement.  For years, the responsibilities 
of the two offices leading the bulk of USAID's humanitarian assistance -- Food for Peace and the 
Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) -- have sharply increased.  While they have 
often coordinated, they have worked in parallel, with separate budgets, separate oversight, and 
different strategies.  When you would visit a camp in the field, they would be together on the 
ground, serving the same community shoulder-to-shoulder -- one providing food, and the other 
tarps and blankets, often using the same partners.   
 
Before I arrived at USAID, the Agency commissioned an assessment of our humanitarian 
programming, conducted by an outside firm, but led by career staff, which concluded, not 
5 
 
 
surprisingly, there were better ways to ensure the nimble, effective, and efficient delivery of our 
humanitarian assistance.  The Request before you proposes to fund all of USAID’s humanitarian 
assistance from one account, and imagines a day when USAID’s humanitarian food and non-
food functions are consolidated into a single entity within the Agency.  This will ensure a 
seamless blend of food and non-food humanitarian USAID assistance, better serving our foreign-
policy interests and people in need.  In the end, we will have a shared strategy, integrated 
programs, and joint monitoring-and-evaluation systems that will provide greater efficiency and 
accountability for the American people.  As part of our effort to consolidate USAID’s 
humanitarian functions, we will also consolidate our whole-of-Agency efforts to strengthen 
partner resilience for improved food security.  This will help break the cycle of recurrent and 
protracted crises, and reduce our own future humanitarian liabilities.   
 
Strengthening Our Private-Sector Engagement 
 
Fulfilling our responsibility to taxpayers is about much more than asking other donors to increase 
their contributions, helping countries to finance their own development, or streamlining our 
humanitarian assistance.  In our case, it also means strengthening private-sector engagement 
through true collaborations.  At USAID, we are reaching beyond contracting and grant-making.  
We are exploring the possibilities for co-creating and co-financing programs, tools, and 
initiatives with private-sector partners.  We're embracing the ingenuity and the entrepreneurship 
that private-enterprise offers, and harnessing the efficiencies and effectiveness that private-sector 
competition and market forces can unlock.  And this is something private-enterprise is eager to 
do alongside us.  Additionally, we will partner closely with the proposed new U.S. Development 
Finance Institution, which will only succeed through strong institutional linkages with USAID, 
to further these efforts with financing tools, and have a whole of government approach to private 
sector engagement.   
 
For example, in February, I met with the CEO of a large multinational company, and he 
expressed his eagerness to work with us in countries like South Africa, which, in part because of 
our work, are becoming more suitable for American companies to invest.  This firm and others 
are eager to invest corporate funds in USAID-led initiatives, as well as apply entrepreneurship 
and enterprise-driven techniques, such as impact investing and blended-finance mechanisms, to 
development challenges.  
 
Another example is the new “Smart Communities Coalition” that we helped create alongside 
MasterCard to modernize assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons.  Traditionally, 
when a displaced family first arrives at a camp or settlement, humanitarian workers do their best 
to see that they are immediately registered and provided modest food, water, and medical 
attention.  Residents receive services from twenty or more different humanitarian aid groups, 
6 
 
 
each of which uses their own unique method of tracking who received what service when.  As 
you can imagine, this is a recipe for potential corruption and abuse. 
 
Our partnership with the Smart Communities Coalition will transform this process for more than 
600,000 people.  Our implementing partners at the camps will harness the Internet and smart-
card technology to do their jobs more efficiently, and at a lower cost.  Displaced families will 
have better access to essential services, such as power.  Just as important, in these “smart 
communities,” we will be better able to track our assistance, decrease fraud and abuse, and 
provide services more quickly and cheaply.  This is the power of private-enterprise making us 
better at meeting our core mission.  
 
Procurement Reform:  Encouraging New Partners and New Partnerships 
 
Yet another way in which we aim to make our precious funding go further is by using innovative 
procurement tools to increase competition among potential partners.  In FY 2017, around 60 
percent of USAID funding went to just 25 organizations.  We are exploring new ways to harness 
new partners and ideas, and lower the “cost” and barriers to entry for potential partners as they 
come forward.  We are encouraging entrepreneurship and ingenuity in program design, building 
out technical expertise in areas such as small grants, and embracing approaches that allow us to 
move more quickly in crafting initiatives and considering submissions.   
 
For example, last Fall, when the Vice President announced the U.S. government’s intent to 
support persecuted religious minorities and other communities in Iraq, USAID was able to move 
from “ideas to action” by using a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) -- a tool you have 
supported that can reduce lead times, allowing us to launch a competitive and collaborative 
research and development process rapidly to solve a specific challenge.  We immediately invited 
the public to submit their ideas for pilot projects that would support the resettlement of ethnic 
and religious minorities in their ancestral homes.  Within 10 weeks, we reviewed more than 100 
submissions, and invited those with the best ideas to join us at a co-creation workshop. in 
Baghdad earlier this month  Coming out of the workshop, we will fund the most promising ideas, 
and, if the pilots are successful, we will consider ways in which they can be scaled up.   
 
As another example, last Fall, I announced the world’s first Development Impact Bond (DIB) for 
maternal and child health-- USAID’s second overall DIB, and one of the world’s largest.  Under 
this new model, private capital funds the initial investment, and USAID pays if, and only if, the 
carefully defined development goal is achieved.   
 
In this case, we are working to strengthen maternal and newborn health care facilities in 
Northern India.  Our partners at the UBS Optimus Foundation are raising capital from private 
investors to finance improvements to over 400 private health facilities.  Teams at these 400 
7 
 
 
facilities will help appropriately train staff, and make life-saving equipment and medicines 
available.  Each facility will then undergo a rigorous review process to ensure it has met the 
appropriate accreditation standards.  If the facilities meet those standards, USAID and our 
matching partner, Merck for Mothers, will pay the UBS Optimus Foundation.  The DIB allows 
us to incentivize results, and lessen taxpayer risk.   
 
I am also working to ensure that our partners operate with the highest level of integrity and 
accountability.  Last month, I met with representatives from InterAction, the Professional 
Services Council, and United Nations agencies to make clear to our partners that USAID will not 
tolerate sexual harassment or misconduct of any kind.  In addition, our Executive Diversity 
Council recently met to take up this important topic.  Coming out of that meeting, I directed the 
Agency’s senior leadership team to take mandatory sexual harassment training, and asked them 
to communicate to our partners the seriousness with which we take this issue.  I also formed a 
new Action Alliance for Preventing Sexual Misconduct, chaired by General Counsel David 
Moore, which will undertake a thorough review of our existing policies and procedures to 
identify and close any potential gaps, while strengthening accountability and compliance, in 
consultation with our external partners.  
 
Transformation:  Building Tomorrow’s USAID 
 
Being good stewards of taxpayer resources cannot be a one-time thing, or merely a set of steps 
aimed at a single budget.  We need to undertake experience-informed, innovation-driven reforms 
to optimize our structures and procedures and maximize our effectiveness.    
 
We are now working to roll out Agency-wide projects through the Transformation process that 
will help to institutionalize some of these ideas.  This effort began in response to an Executive 
Order from the President, but, even if that had never happened, I would still have argued for the 
reforms we are planning.  Over the last eight months, I and others at USAID have met with 
Congressional Committees and personal offices nearly 40 times to discuss our plans.  Your input, 
and that of your staff, has been invaluable to our process, and I am deeply appreciative of your 
engagement and support.    
 
Transformation includes many of the proposals I have shared today, including procurement 
reform, as well as streamlining our humanitarian assistance programing.  It also includes 
working with the Administration on cross-cutting government reorganization proposals, such as 
the new U.S. Development Finance Institution and the consolidation of small grants functions 
and expertise into USAID.   
 
To prepare for our work on Transformation, on March 9, Deputy Secretary of State John 
Sullivan wrote to inform me that USAID ""should initiate its own hiring processes to 
accommodate the Agency's staffing needs.""  In line with that directive, we have officially lifted 
8 
 
 
our hiring freeze.  Moving forward, we will use our Hiring and Reassignment Review Board to 
seek to align our workforce-planning with the Administration’s priorities and our plans under the 
Transformation.   
 
Another example of efforts we are undertaking through the Transformation are the metrics that 
we are developing.  If the goal of our development assistance is to help partner countries create 
the commitment and capacity needed to take on their own development journey, we should focus 
our assistance on interventions that will best help them get there.  We are working on metrics 
that will serve as mileposts to help us understand where our partners are going, and what role we 
might play in their journey.   
 
These metrics are still a work in progress, and we will continue to consult with you as we 
develop them, but, if we are successful, they will make our programing more effective, and our 
foreign policy priorities better informed.  The same is true for all of the work that is taking place 
through the Transformation effort.  All of this is in service of helping our partners help 
themselves.  All of it is to provide the proverbial “hand-up.”  And all of it points towards a world 
where foreign assistance is no longer needed -- a world where people are self-reliant, prosperous, 
and capable of crafting their own bright future.  
 
Conclusion 
 
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the Committee, I believe we are shaping an 
Agency that is capable of leveraging our influence, authority, and available resources to advance 
U.S. interests, transform the way we provide humanitarian and development assistance, and, 
alongside the rest of the world, help meet the daunting challenges we all see today.  With your 
support and guidance, we will ensure USAID remains the world’s premier international 
development Agency and continues the important work we do, each day, to protect America’s 
future security and prosperity.  Thank you for allowing me to speak with you today, and I 
welcome your questions.

BEFORE THE 
 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND 
DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES 
 
UNITED STATES SENATE 
 
 
 
April 24, 2018 
 
Good afternoon Chairman Hoeven, Ranking Member Merkley, and Members of the 
Subcommittee.  Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the President’s 
Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget request for FDA.  
First, I would like to thank the Committee for your continued support of the Agency.  FDA 
has received strong bipartisan support throughout the appropriations process in recent years and FY 
2018 was no different.  I believe this support reflects our shared commitment to the vital role FDA 
has protecting and promoting the public health.  The funding this Subcommittee provides is essential 
to the Agency fulfilling its mission.  The professional staff of FDA is grateful for the support of their 
work and the funding increases the Subcommittee provided FDA in FY 2018.   
Last year was a record year for medical products at FDA in several ways: novel drug 
approvals, generic drug approvals, and novel medical device approvals.  The record number of 
approvals in 2017 reflects the remarkable opportunities we have at this critical inflection point in 
science and technology.  Advances in medicine and science are providing opportunities that can 
fundamentally change health in America and the outlook for many patients with life threatening and 
chronic diseases.  At the same time that we have many new opportunities offered by advanced 
medical technologies; we cannot lose sight of our commitment to the public health basics – reducing 
smoking rates, preventing kids from initiating use of tobacco products, supporting healthy food 
choices that can lead to better nutrition and reduced risk of disease, and increasing vaccination rates. 
FDA is committed to all of these and other public health goals.  With your continued support, we 
have more opportunity to deliver on the promises of science than at any other time in the past.   
The funding provided in the President’s FY 2019 Budget (Budget) will allow the Agency to 
sustain its current work—protecting the safety of the food and medical products consumers use every 
day—and build on these efforts by requesting additional resources to make significant progress on 
several important fronts; including, fostering innovation and competition to bring better and more 
1 
 
affordable products to market, combatting the opioid epidemic, and implementing the 21st Century 
Cures Act (Cures).    
Overall, the Budget requests $5.8 billion in total resources for FDA—which is an increase of 
$663 million or 13 percent above the FY 2018 Annualized Continuing Resolution.  At this total level, 
the Budget includes an increase of $473 million in budget authority and an increase of $190 million 
in user fees.  The Budget requests considerable new resources for FDA and makes significant new 
investments in advancing critical areas of science, domestic technology, and public health.  
As the regulatory Agency responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of more than 
$2.4 trillion worth of products used by consumers, I remain steadfast that these funds are critical 
investments in our public health agency. They will allow us to more efficiently advance safe and 
effective new opportunities to Americans. 
I.  FY 2019 Initiatives  
The Budget includes an increase of approximately $400 million in additional resources to 
advance initiatives to promote public health and spur growth in the domestic economy.  These new 
initiatives provide a renewed focus to some of the Agency’s most intensely followed issues—
facilitating regulatory pathways to increase patients’ access to safe and effective drugs, biologics, and 
medical devices, and access to higher quality compounded drugs for the patients who need them; 
better informing patients and providers about pre-and post-market safety of medical products; and, 
increasing competition among generic drugs in order to lower the cost of generic drugs.  
I believe that these new efforts represent discrete areas where targeted additional resources 
can help the Agency make a meaningful difference for American consumers.  A few examples of the 
new initiatives are described below.    
 
 
2 
 
A.  Advancing Modern Drug and Biological Product Manufacturing Technologies, Through 
the Development of Efficient Regulatory Pathways 
Advanced manufacturing technologies, such as continuous manufacturing, can improve the 
agility, flexibility, cost and robustness of drug and biologic manufacturing processes.  These 
technologies have great potential to accelerate new, more targeted therapies, enhance product quality 
and bolster stability in the U.S. drug supply to meet patient needs.  For example, continuous 
manufacturing has the potential to help address and eliminate drug shortages and reduce recalls 
related to problems with product or facility quality.  Further, with continuous manufacturing 
platforms for biologics, vaccine manufacturing, for example, could be ramped up on short notice, and 
vaccines themselves adapted over a shorter time period to address infectious diseases, such as the flu.  
This would help address the challenge we face annually with the flu season. As a result of the long 
manufacturing cycle required when using traditional egg based manufacturing technologies, 
manufacturers must select the flu strain that will be included in the upcoming flu season’s vaccines 
six months prior to the flu season. By reducing the amount of time it takes to ramp up manufacturing, 
we can start manufacturing closer to the start of flu season to minimize or eliminate the matching 
issues we face, to varying degrees, each year and increase the efficacy of the flu vaccine.  Advances 
in manufacturing could provide a more certain, and nearer-term opportunity to address challenges 
with flu vaccine supply and effectiveness while we continue to work on longer term, newer vaccine 
technology such as a universal vaccine. 
Despite the promise of these manufacturing improvements, industry remains reluctant to 
invest in these platforms. Additional regulatory principles and tools to help manufacturers implement 
and assess these platforms could accelerate their adoption.  It would give manufacturers greater 
certainty that products developed through continuous manufacturing can be efficiently reviewed and 
gain market entry.  
3 
 
In these ways, FDA can encourage industry to utilize these new technologies by developing a 
science-based framework that includes the regulatory tools and guidance for how products developed 
in these systems will be evaluated.  As an additional benefit, these small-footprint, high-technology 
manufacturing platforms are likely to be domiciled in the U.S. As a result, their adoption could return 
more product manufacturing to domestic sites, which could help public health, enhance our national 
security, and foster job creation.  The Budget requests $58 million in FY 2019 for advancing this 
initiative.   
B.  Establishing the Outsourcing Facility Sector as a Robust and Reliable Source of 
Compounded Products 
Since Congress passed the Drug Quality and Security Act in 2013 (DQSA), patient access to 
better quality compounded drugs has been a chief concern for the Agency, physicians, and patients 
alike.  Outsourcing facilities have the ability to produce and distribute larger amounts of compounded 
products to meet the needs of individual patients for whom such drugs are appropriate, including by 
making office stock that is used by hospitals and clinics.  Outsourcing facilities are an important 
component to our health system and the Agency is committed to clarifying and appropriately 
tailoring policies so they can continue to provide drugs, based on the clinical need for a compounded 
medicine, so patients have access to the products they need. 
The Budget proposes the creation of a “Center of Excellence on Compounding for 
Outsourcing Facilities” and expanded FDA engagement with outsourcing facilities and states to help 
the pharmacy outsourcing industry grow to meet its intended function and adhere to good 
manufacturing practices (GMPs) to protect patient health.  We see an opportunity to make 
investments in regulatory policy and personnel that could help more compounding pharmacies 
become outsourcing facilities.  This, in turn, would allow these pharmacies to grow and serve more 
patient needs, including through the provision of office stock compounded under GMP standards, 
promoting access to better quality compounded drugs for patients who have medical needs that 
4 
 
otherwise cannot be met by an FDA approved drug.  These new outsourcing facilities would 
represent a largely domestic industry and a new area of growth in the healthcare sector.  The Budget 
requests $25 million in FY 2019 for this initiative.   
C.  Bring MedTech Manufacturing Home: Advance Medical Device Manufacturing and 
Quality 
The Budget proposes to establish a voluntary program for device manufacturers to receive an 
independent assessment of manufacturing and product quality criteria intended to demonstrate 
sustained organizational excellence.  This would make the process for introducing innovations in 
how medical devices are manufactured more efficient and predictable.  In turn, this program would 
encourage device manufacturers to make investments to re-tool their manufacturing processes in 
ways that can facilitate manufacturing innovation, encourage investment in new production methods 
and materials, and lead to better medical products. 
This more modern and nimble framework would make it more efficient for device developers 
to innovate manufacturing processes in ways that can allow devices to better meet the needs of 
patients and the expectations of providers – such as through intelligent, automated processes that 
monitor and record manufacturing quality metrics, incorporating features and technological 
characteristics that can contribute to better options and higher quality that achieves their clinical 
purpose.  Implementing this framework would help increase manufacturing innovation, accelerate 
availability of high-quality devices to patients and foster a competitive marketplace around device 
quality similar to other industries, such as automotive and aerospace, that could advance device 
innovations, reduce manufacturing costs and improve the quality and safety of medical devices.  As 
medical devices become more complex – and given the frequent modifications made to devices –
spurring advanced manufacturing and creating a competitive marketplace for device quality is critical 
for both driving technological innovations and assuring patient safety.  The Budget requests $12 
million in FY 2019 for this initiative.

D.  Create a New Medical Data Enterprise  
  Advances in technology have the potential to improve the availability and utility of real 
world evidence (RWE) and real world data1 (RWD).  This data provides researchers the opportunity 
to answer questions about treatment effects and outcomes more efficiently, saving time and money, 
while yielding answers more relevant to broader populations of patients than might be possible in a 
specialized research environment. This data can also help streamline clinical development and inform 
the safe and effective use of medical products.   
  The Budget proposes to advance the use of this real-world experience to better inform patient 
care and provide more efficient, robust and potentially lower-cost ways to develop clinical data that 
can inform product review and promote innovation.  The Budget requests funding to establish a new 
capability, including the development of data and analytical tools, to conduct near-real-time evidence 
evaluation down to the level of individual electronic health records for at least 10 million individuals 
in a broad range of U.S. healthcare settings.  
  Expanding the FDA’s capacity to use RWE to evaluate medical products would generate 
processes that could improve the efficiency of the regulatory process, better inform patients and 
providers about pre-and post-market safety,  reduce some of the burdens that drive up the time and 
cost required to bring beneficial innovations to the market, and address barriers that can make certain 
important safety and effectiveness information around the real-world use of products hard to collect 
and evaluate.  Harnessing the power and potential of RWE is especially critical for finding treatments 
                                                           
1 Examples of RWD include data derived from electronic health records (EHRs), claims and 
billing data, data from product and disease registries, patient-generated data including in-home 
use settings, and data gathered from other sources such as mobile devices that can provide 
information about health status. 
6 
 
and cures for rare disease.  Establishing a strong understanding of each disease and completing 
clinical trials is especially challenging; however, RWE holds enormous promise for improving 
understanding of disease and thus, development of treatments and cures.  Funding in this area will 
allow FDA to develop regulatory standards for use of RWE to support medical product applications. 
The Budget requests $100 million in FY 2019 for this initiative.   
E.  Facilitate Growth and Spur Transformation of the Digital Health Technology Industry by 
Shifting Regulation to an Efficient and Novel Framework for Reliable Post-Market 
Oversight 
Digital health products are at the forefront of helping us diagnose and treat our society’s 
increasingly complex medical needs. Health care providers use the latest technological tools to help 
them screen, detect and treat diseases ranging from cancers to neurological conditions like 
Alzheimer’s.  Patients utilize mobile medical applications to manage conditions like diabetes and 
treat substance use disorder.  However, the current regulatory framework is not well-suited for these 
modern technologies. Every single day, these technologies are helping patients and doctors make 
health care decisions. 
As part of our efforts to support timely access to safe and effective digital health products, 
the FDA is working collaboratively with industry, patients and providers to establish a new paradigm 
for digital health technologies under which a company could market lower-risk products without 
FDA premarket review and market higher-risk products following a streamlined FDA premarket 
review if  the company receives a prior third-party certification for engaging in high-quality software 
design and testing (validation) and ongoing maintenance.  This regulatory model would be fully 
proven and expanded from its current pilot status to a broader program.  For low-risk products, rather 
than evaluate each individual digital health product before the product comes to market, the FDA 
would instead focus its resources on validating the quality of a firm’s software design and the firm’s 
methods for certifying the quality and reliability of its underlying software performance.  The agency 
7 
 
would further reduce the time and cost of market entry of digital health technologies while assuring 
appropriate patient safeguards by relying on postmarket collection of real-world data to support new 
and evolving product functions.  The Budget also proposes the creation of and resources for a Center 
of Excellence on Digital Health to establish this regulatory paradigm, build new capacity to evaluate 
and recognize third-party certifiers, and support an internal cybersecurity unit and an external public-
private partnership of experts to complement the advances in software-based devices. Implementing 
these regulatory innovations and information technology improvements are essential for advancing 
technologies to improve the health and quality of life of patients while assuring critical safeguards. 
The Budget requests $70 million in FY 2019 for this initiative. 
F.  Modernize Generic Drug Development and Review  
Increasing patients’ access to more affordable prescription drugs is a top issue for Americans 
and one that I am personally dedicated to addressing during my tenure as Commissioner.  Last May, 
in one of my first actions as Commissioner, I announced FDA’s Drug Competition Action Plan.  The 
plan has three overarching principals: eliminate gaming by branded companies that can delay generic 
drug entry; resolving scientific and regulatory obstacles that can make it difficult to earn approval of 
generic versions of certain complex drugs; and improving the efficiency and predictability of FDA’s 
generic review process to reduce the time it takes to get a new generic drug approved and lessen the 
number of review cycles undergone by generic applications before approval. As part of this process, 
we also prioritized review for certain generic applications where there was a lack of competition, a 
situation under which consumers could face high prices for some very old medicines. 
The Budget builds on this plan by proposing to establish a new review platform to modernize 
generic drug review and support efforts to update generics labels.  This investment will foster greater 
use of lower-cost generics as a way to improve patient access and create competition in order to 
lower drug costs. For example, too many generic labels remain out-of-date because there is no longer 
a sponsor involved that is able to update the labels with new information about safe and effective 
8 
 
new uses for these medicines.  If we incorporate into generic drug labels all of the current 
information about their safe and effective use, it could promote more prescribing of generic drugs, 
reducing overall healthcare costs.  The Budget requests $38 million in FY 2019 for this initiative.   
II.  Opioids  
One of my highest priorities as FDA Commissioner is combatting the ongoing crisis of 
opioid addiction. As part of this commitment, we are reexamining the Agency’s authorities and 
policies in this area and working to ensure that FDA has the proper tools and resources to address 
this epidemic as it continues to evolve.   
Thanks to the support of this Subcommittee, FDA received a total of $94 million in the FY 
2018 Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act (P.L. 115-141) signed into law last month to address 
the interdiction of illegal drugs, including narcotics, through our work in the international mail 
facilities.  Recognizing the Agency’s responsibility in helping to curb the flow of these counterfeit 
and illegal drugs from entering our communities, and the critical public health obligation that the 
FDA was entrusted with through these additional resources, I am pleased to report the Agency will 
start to invest this new funding in purchasing equipment and assessing additional technologies we 
might deploy before the end of this fiscal year.   
But FDA’s efforts related to addressing the opioid crisis are broad, and there are many new 
programs we would like to pursue in this mission.  The Budget requests an additional $10 million to 
provide technical assistance related to clinical study design related to medication-assisted treatments, 
and to also accelerate the development of non-opioid treatments, devices to treat chronic pain, and 
generic versions of opioid drug products with abuse deterrent formulations.  One way FDA will use 
the resources is funding studies to identify additional tools and methodologies that can be used to 
evaluate whether differences in formulations impact abuse deterrence.  These are small steps, but 
collectively, over time I am confident they can work together, along with the efforts of so many other 
of our federal, state, and local partners to make a difference.   
9 
 
 
III.  Cures  
  Implementation of Cures has been another top priority of the Agency over the past 16 
months.  Cures includes provisions that have the potential to impart far-reaching effects on scientific 
advancements in medical product development. The new law complements many efforts underway at 
FDA.  All of these efforts are aimed at transforming the way we support product development and 
maintaining FDA’s gold standard for safety and effectiveness.  Toward these efforts, last June, the 
Agency published our required work plan for implementing Cures, which includes details of how the 
Agency will utilize the $500 million in authorized new funds over nine years.  For FY 2019, the 
Budget requests a total of $70 million to support our implementation work. 
I want to thank you for your support on this vital work so far.  I look forward to working with 
you on supporting the Agency’s implementation efforts in the future.   
VI.   Conclusion 
The last year was historic for the Agency.  We are diligently working on a number of fronts 
and the vital work we do provides Americans with better ways to improve their health and welfare, 
and empowers consumers to make informed choices about the products they use and the foods they 
feed to their families.  The Budget will help FDA maintain and complement our current efforts, as 
well as provide a renewed focus and investment in some of the Agency’s and the nation’s top public 
health priorities.  I look forward to answering your questions today and to working with all of you 
going forward.
